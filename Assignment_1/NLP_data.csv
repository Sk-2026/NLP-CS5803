Hyderabad City Police
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Law enforcement agency
Freedom from Fear Forever [1]
Agency overview
28 March 1847; 177 years ago (1847-03-28)
Jurisdictional structure
Hyderabad City Police is the local law enforcement agency for the city of Hyderabad , Telangana and is headed by the Commissioner of Police . The city police traces its origins to 1847 under Hyderabad State . [3]
History
[ edit ]
The Nizam of Hyderabad used to appoint the commissioners of police who were officers of the Hyderabad Civil Service and they used to function during his pleasure. They were answerable to the Nizam directly on various matters of policing in Hyderabad city. However, as far as administrative matters were concerned the commissioner of police used to correspond with the Home Department directly. The commissioner of police was popularly called ""Kotwal"" and was responsible for the maintenance of the law and order, prevention and detection of crime, etc. [3]
Reorganization
[ edit ]
Due to rapid increase in population, there has been a steady increase in crime. In view of the above in 1981 the city police was re-organised, vide G.O.Ms.No.341, Home Department, dated: 1981-05-30. The following structure was instituted:
The disciplinary and administrative control of the force is held by the Commissioner of Police , having powers and functions of additional district magistrate .
The city was divided into five zones: south, east, west, central and north, the four[ clarification needed ] zones were again divided into 12 divisions. Each zone is in the charge of a deputy commissioner of police of the rank of a superintendent of police for maintenance of law and order , criminal investigation and keeping up the morale of the force.
Each division is under the care of an assistant commissioner of police of the rank of deputy superintendent of police, who works under the control of deputy commissioner of police. He is responsible for prevention and detection of crimes, maintenance of law and order and discipline of the force.
Each police station is under the care of an inspector of police who is the station house officer and performs all the duties and exercises all the powers of that office.
The city crimes station was renamed as ""Detective Department"" which works under the deputy commissioner of police, assisted by assistant commissioners of police and inspectors.
In 1992, the Government of Andhra Pradesh sanctioned three joint commissioners of police posts in the rank of deputy inspector general to assist the commissioner of police for effective functioning and better administration of city police each in-charge of co-ordination, crimes and security.
One sub-inspector of police was to be placed in charge of law and order duties and another for crime duties for each police station. A divisional detective inspector for each division was provided for. In order to achieve this functional division it was proposed in the scheme to increases the number of posts of sub-inspectors and head constables and decrease the number of posts of police constables.plus in the corona time the police doing very good and in 2020 rainy season they were protecting still in heavy rain go police
In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was split into two. Hyderabad became a part of Telangana.

Asia - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia,"Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for Asia [87]
Asia has extremely diverse climate features. Climates range from Arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere , and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan.
Climate change
The 2022 South Asian floods , including in Pakistan (pictured) are an example of a climate change impact. [88] [89]
Climate change is particularly important in Asia, as the continent accounts for the majority of the human population. Warming since the 20th century is increasing the threat of heatwaves across the entire continent. [90] : 1459 Heatwaves lead to increased mortality, and the demand for air conditioning is rapidly accelerating as the result. By 2080, around 1 billion people in the cities of South and Southeast Asia are expected to experience around a month of extreme heat every year. [90] : 1460 The impacts on water cycle are more complicated: already arid regions, primarily located in West Asia and Central Asia , will see more droughts , while areas of East , Southeast and South Asia which are already wet due to the monsoons will experience more flooding. [90] : 1459
The waters around Asia are subjected to the same impacts as elsewhere, such as the increased warming and ocean acidification . [90] : 1465 There are many coral reefs in the region, and they are highly vulnerable to climate change, [90] : 1459 to the point practically all of them will be lost if the warming exceeds 1.5 °C (2.7 °F). [91] [92] Asia's distinctive mangrove ecosystems are also highly vulnerable to sea level rise . [90] : 1459 Asia also has more countries with large coastal populations than any other continent, which would cause large economic impacts from sea level rise. [90] : 1459 Water supplies in the Hindu Kush region will become more unstable as its enormous glaciers , known as the ""Asian water towers"", gradually melt. [90] : 1459 These changes to water cycle also affect vector-borne disease distribution, with malaria and dengue fever expected to become more prominent in the tropical and subtropical regions. [90] : 1459 Food security will become more uneven, and South Asian countries could experience significant impacts from global food price volatility. [90] : 1494
Climate change is expected to exacerbate heat stress over at the North China Plain , which is particularly vulnerable as widespread irrigation results in very moist air. There is a risk that agricultural labourers will be physically unable to work outdoors on hot summer days at the end of the century, particularly under the scenario of greatest emissions and warming. [93]
Historical emissions from Asia are lower than those from Europe and North America. However, China has been the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the 21st century, while India is the third-largest. As a whole, Asia currently accounts for 36% of world's primary energy consumption, which is expected to increase to 48% by 2050. By 2040, it is also expected to account for 80% of the world's coal and 26% of the world's natural gas consumption. [90] : 1468 While the United States remains the world's largest oil consumer, by 2050 it is projected to move to third place, behind China and India. [90] : 1470 While nearly half of the world's new renewable energy capacity is built in Asia, [90] : 1470 this is not yet sufficient in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement . They imply that the renewables would account for 35% of total energy consumption in Asia by 2030. [90] : 1471
Climate change adaptation is already a reality for many Asian countries, with a wide range of strategies attempted across the continent. [90] : 1534 Important examples include the growing implementation of climate-smart agriculture in certain countries or the "" sponge city "" planning principles in China. [90] : 1534 While some countries have drawn up extensive frameworks such as the Bangladesh Delta Plan or Japan's Climate Adaptation Act, [90] : 1508 others still rely on localized actions that are not effectively scaled up. [90] : 1534
Economy
Singapore has one of the busiest container ports in the world and is the world's fourth largest foreign exchange trading hub
Asia has the largest continental economy in the world by both GDP nominal and PPP values, and is the fastest growing economic region. [94] As of 2023 [update] , China is by far the largest economy on the continent, making up nearly half of the continent's economy by GDP nominal. It is followed by Japan, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which are all ranked among the top 20 largest economies both by nominal and PPP values. [95] Based on Global Office Locations 2011, Asia dominated the office locations with 4 of the top 5 being in Asia: Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul . Around 68 percent of international firms have an office in Hong Kong. [96]
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economy of China [97] had an average annual growth rate of more than 8%. According to economic historian Angus Maddison , India had the world's largest economy during 1000 BCE and 1 CE. India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century, contributing 25% of the world's industrial output. [98] [99] [100] [101] China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with India. [102] [16] [103] For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in net material product) in 1990 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or APEC ). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy. It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2027. [94]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP by currency exchange rates was almost as large as that of the rest of Asia combined. [94] In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the US as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen /US$. Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim , known as the Asian tigers , which are now all considered developed economies, having among the highest GDP per capita in Asia. [104] [94]
Mumbai is one of the most populous cities on the continent. The city is an infrastructure and tourism hub, and plays a crucial role in the economy of India
Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum , forests , fish , water , rice , copper and silver . Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan , South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations , but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure. [105] [106]
According to Citigroup in 2011, 9 of 11 Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth. They are Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. [107] Asia has three main financial centers: Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore. Call centers and business process outsourcing (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers. The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing. [108]
Trade between Asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for Asia. Individual main routes have emerged from this. The main route leads from the Chinese coast south via Hanoi to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the Strait of Malacca via the Sri Lankan Colombo to the southern tip of India via Malé to East Africa Mombasa (see also: Indo-Pacific ), from there to Djibouti , then through the Red Sea over the Suez Canal into Mediterranean (see also: Indo-Mediterranean ), there via Haifa, Istanbul and Athens to the upper Adriatic to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe or further to Barcelona and around Spain and France to the European northern ports. A far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via South Africa to Europe . A particularly significant part of the Asian goods traffic is carried out across the Pacific towards Los Angeles and Long Beach . The melting of the Arctic is also paving the way for new shipping routes from Northeast Asia to Europe and North America. [109] In contrast to the sea routes, the Silk Road via the land route to Europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope. Intra-Asian trade, including sea trade, is growing rapidly. [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117]
In 2010, Asia had 3.3 million millionaires (people with net worth over US$1 million excluding their homes), slightly below North America with 3.4 million millionaires. In 2011, Asia topped Europe in number of millionaires. [118] Citigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's ""economic center of gravity"" continued moving east. At the end of 2011, there were 18,000 Asian people mainly in Southeast Asia, China and Japan who have at least $100 million in disposable assets, while North America with 17,000 people and Western Europe with 14,000 people.

Kancharla Gopanna ( Telugu : కంచర్ల గోపన్న)  ( c. 1620 – 1688), popularly known as Bhakta Ramadasu or Bhadrachala Ramadasu ( Telugu : భద్రాచల రామదాసు), was a 17th-century devotee of the Hindu god Rama , a saint-poet and a composer of Carnatic music . He is a famous Vaggeyakara (classical composer) [a] from the Telugu classical era. He was born in the village of Nelakondapalli in Khammam district , and orphaned as a teenager. He spent his later years in Bhadrachalam and 12 years in solitary confinement at the Golconda prison during the Qutb Shahi rule. Different mythical stories about his life circulate in the Telugu tradition. He is renowned for constructing the famous Sita Ramachandraswamy Temple and pilgrimage center on the banks of river Godavari at Bhadrachalam. His devotional kirtana lyrics to Rama illustrate the classical Pallavi, Anupallavi and Charanam genre composed mostly in Telugu, some in Sanskrit and with occasional use of Tamil language. These are famous in South Indian classical music as Ramadaasu Keertanalu.[ citation needed ]
Ramadasu was a Sri Vaishnava . [1] Ramadasu was a writer of Telugu satakams . He wrote the Daasarathi Satakamu (దాశరథి శతకము) with a 'makuTamu' (మకుటము) 'Daasarathee Karunaa payonidhee' (దాశరథీ  కరుణా పయోనిధీ), a collection of nearly 108 poems dedicated to Rama. [2]
Early life and background
[ edit ]
Kancherla Gopanna (Goparaju), later known as Bhakta Ramadasu, was born in a moderately well to do Telugu speaking Niyogi Brahmin family to Linganna Mantri and Kamamba in Nelakondapalli village in the Khammam District of Telangana . He was orphaned in the teens, triggering an impoverished life, sustained by singing bhakti songs to Rama and collecting rice door to door. [3] His life story has been largely reconstructed from poems he composed or is assumed to have composed, where there is a mention of events of his life. For example, one bhakti song mentions Narayanadasulu, a term linked to the Narayana mantra, is believed to be linked to Sri Vaishnavism guru Raghunatha Bhattacharya, who initiated him as a boy into the Dasarathi tradition. These and other hagiographic accounts found in Yakshagana or Harikatha compilations present him as a boy-prodigy with an impulsively creative mind composing lyrics on the Hindu god Rama. [4]
His maternal uncles were the Madanna and Akkanna brothers. They had helped Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (Tana Shah) gain power after the death of Abdullah Qutb Shah in 1672, Tana Shah's father-in-law. As reward for their material support during a period of power struggle with Aurangzeb and the Mughal Empire, the brothers were appointed ministers at the court of Tana Shah of the Qutb Shahi dynasty in Kingdom of Golconda . [5] They helped their orphaned nephew Gopanna. Beyond this, little is known about his early life and much is shrouded in mythistory created by the later hagiographic tradition. He is said to have learned Telugu , Sanskrit , Persian , and Urdu . [3]
Career
[ edit ]
In 1650, Gopanna traveled to Hyderabad to meet his maternal uncles, who were at that time working in the tax department of Golconda Sultanate under the minister Mirza Mohammed Sayyad. They persuaded the minister to give a job to their nephew Gopanna. Mirza Mohammed Sayyad appointed Gopanna in tax collection department in Bhadrachalam, where the temple dedicated to Rama already existed. [6]
A different version of his career is found in Ramadasu Charitra, a hagiographic Telugu text. It states that sometime after 1672, Ramadasu in his early 50s, was appointed as the tahsildar (tax collector) of 'Palvoncha Paragana' by Akkanna, his uncle, who was then a minister and the administrative head in the court of Qutub Shahi Sultan Abul Hassan Tana Shah . [6]
There are contradictory stories about his life after he became the tehsildar and led the tax collection activities at Bhadrachalam. All these stories share a common theme – he collecting Jizya religious tax from Hindus in Bhadrachalam area, he reconstructing or building anew the famed large Rama temple of Bhadrachalam, partly with donations and partly with tax he had collected for the Golconda Sultanate, his arrest on charges of fraud and misuse of the taxes, he spending 12 years in solitary confinement in Golconda prison where he composed poems for the Lord Rama, his release and return to Bhadrachalam. In some version, god Rama and his brother Lakshmana reappear on earth and pay the ransom demanded by Golconda Sultanate for his release. In other versions, the Sultan under attack from Aurangzeb forces and facing imminent collapse, opens a new trial, finds him innocent and acquits him. The varying accounts are found in the records of the Dutch East India company, the temple's hagiography, and the regional Telugu oral traditions. [6] [7]
Reconstruction of temple
Sri Ramanavami Kalyanam utsava at Bhadrachalam Temple , in Telangana
Once, Ramadasu visited Bhadrachalam for a Jatara (fair) and was disturbed by the dilapidated state of the Rama temple there. Bhadrachalam is significant to devotees of Rama for many reasons. Lord Rama stayed near the Parnasala there with Sita and Lakshmana during his exile and also visited Shabari near Bhadrachalam (although it is believed that Shabari used to live near Kishkindha , the kingdom of Vanaras in Ramayana which is believed to be near Hampi ). Pothana is believed to have been given direction by Rama to translate the Bhagavata Purana into Telugu here. In spite of its significance, the temple was utterly neglected. So, Ramadasu started to raise funds for the renovation and reconstruction of the temple. After he emptied his coffers and could raise no more money, the villagers appealed him to spend his revenue collections for the reconstruction and promised to repay the amount after harvesting crops. As such, Ramadas finished the reconstruction of the temple with six hundred thousand rupees collected from land revenues - without the permission of the Abul Hasan Qutb Shah .
As the temple was nearing completion, he was perplexed one night about fixing the Sudarshana Chakra at the crest of the main temple. On the same night, it is believed that he saw Rama in his dream and asked him to have a holy dip in the Godavari River . When Gopanna did so the next day, it is believed that he found the holy Sudarshana Chakra in the river very easily.
Incarceration
[ edit ]
The story continues that soon after the reconstruction, his miseries started. He was dismissed from his job by his enemies who spread a lot of fake news. [8] (near Hyderabad ) Ramadas was cast into jail with orders that he be released only after the exchequer received all the taxes in full. Ramadas implores Rama through many emotional songs that were popularized from the stanzas of 'Dasaradhi Sathakam ' and 'Keertanas' of Bhakta Ramadasa. They praise the Lord for all his mysterious ways in popularizing his devotees and Ramadas regularly sings to the Lord. The songs end in a state of total and unconditional surrender to the will of the Almighty.
Release and Sultan's unanticipated devotion towards Rama
[ edit ]
After twelve years, Sultan Tana Shah saw Rama in his dream and found Rama mudras (golden coins with Rama's image on it) beside him.Thereafter he released Ramadasu and established a tradition to send Pearls to the Bhadrachalam temple on every Rama Navami festival and this tradition was continued by the next rulers like Nizams of Hyderabad . [9]
Compositions
[ edit ]
Ramadasu is one of the bhakti movement poet-saints of Hinduism, and a revered composer in the Carnatic music tradition. His compositions are largely kirtan genre, all focused on the Hindu god Rama of the Ramayana fame. He is most known for his pallavi, anupallavi and caranam compositions in Telugu and some in Sanskrit. His musical mudras vary and are remembered by his name or his favorite place Bhadrachalam; for example, Ramadas, Bhadrachalavasa, Bhadradri, Bhadragiri, Bhadrasyla and others. His compositions were popular in his days, and influenced many into the modern age. This includes Tyagaraja who dedicated 5 of his own compositions in praise of Ramadasu, with one equating him to figures such as the Narada muni and bhakta Prahlada, legendary and much loved personalities in Hinduism. [10]
He composed Dasarathi Satakam, a bhakti poem with didactic metric style whose lines and stanzas are often sung or shared in the regional Telugu tradition. [11] However, like the works of many poet-saints and philosophers on the Indian subcontinent, it is unclear which of the poems attributed to Ramadasu were authentically composed by him. There are six compilations named after Ramadasu, four of which are all called Ramadasu Charitra, one called Bhadrachala Ramadasu and another called Bhakta Ramadasu. These are in the form of a Yakshagana or Harikatha about Ramadasu and his songs. They are from six authors – Yadavadasu, Singaridasu, Krishnadasu, Ayyagiri Veerbhadra Rao, Balaji Dasu, and Pentapati Rao. Many contain between 100 and 108, but one has 137 songs attributed to Ramadasu. Taken together, a total of 190 different compositions have been attributed to him, with one critical edition attributing 37 songs before he was arrested by Islamic authorities, 64 while he was held in jail for 12 years, and 31 songs in the final years after his release. Thus, 132 songs are likely to have been composed by Ramadasu. Further, a notable feature of Ramadasu's compositions is his knowledge and his use of ragas from both South Indian schools (20 ragas) and North Indian schools (17 ragas), thereby uniting the two classical musical traditions. [12]
In non-scholarly claims feeding the popular imagination, many more compositions are attributed to him. For example, according to the Indian newspaper The Hindu, Ramadasu composed nearly 300 songs and his works on Rama moved the Sultan. [13] The Navaratna krithis of Ramadasu are as follows:

Ahmedabad ( /ˈɑːmədəbæd, -bɑːd/ AH-mə-də-ba(h)d ), also spelled as Amdavad (
Gujarati: [ˈəmd̪ɑʋɑd̪] ), is the most populous city in the Indian state of Gujarat . It is the administrative headquarters of the Ahmedabad district and the seat of the Gujarat High Court . Ahmedabad's population of 5,570,585 (per the 2011 population census) makes it the fifth-most populous city in India, [14] and the encompassing urban agglomeration population estimated at 6,357,693 is the seventh-most populous in India. Ahmedabad's 2024 population is now estimated at 8,854,444. [15] Ahmedabad is located near the banks of the Sabarmati River , [16] 25 km (16 mi) [17] from the capital of Gujarat , Gandhinagar , also known as its twin city. [18]
Ahmedabad has emerged as an important economic and industrial hub in India. It is the second-largest producer of cotton in India, due to which it was known as the ' Manchester of India' along with Kanpur . Ahmedabad's stock exchange (before it was shut down in 2018) was the country's second oldest. Cricket is a popular sport in Ahmedabad; a newly built stadium, called Narendra Modi Stadium , at Motera can accommodate 132,000 spectators, making it the largest stadium in the world . The world-class Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave is currently under construction and once complete, it will be one of the biggest sports centers (Sports City) in India. The effects of the liberalisation of the Indian economy have energised the city's economy towards tertiary sector activities such as commerce, communication and construction. [19] Ahmedabad's increasing population has resulted in an increase in the construction and housing industries, resulting in the development of skyscrapers. [20]
In 2010, Ahmedabad was ranked third in Forbes 's list of fastest growing cities of the decade. [21] In 2012, The Times of India chose Ahmedabad as India's best city to live in. [22] The gross domestic product of Ahmedabad metro was estimated at $136.1 billion in 2023. [23] [24] In 2020, Ahmedabad was ranked as the third-best city in India to live by the Ease of Living Index. [25] In July 2022, Time magazine included Ahmedabad in its list of world's 50 greatest places of 2022. [26]
Ahmedabad has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under the Government of India 's flagship Smart Cities Mission . [27] In July 2017, the historic city of Ahmedabad , or Old Ahmedabad, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage City . [28]
History
[ edit ]
Based on relics found in several neighbourhoods of the old city and on writings of the Persian historian al-Biruni , it is surmised that an early Bhil tribal group settlement was known as Ashaval . [29] [30]
According to Merutunga , Karna , the Chaulukya (Solanki) ruler of Anhilvada (modern Patan ), successfully launched a military campaign against Ashaval and founded a city nearby called Karnavati. [29] The location of Karnavati is not definitively known. [30] References from the 14th and 15th centuries mention Ashaval but do not mention Karnavati. [30]
Ahmad Shah I of the Gujarat Sultanate transferred its capital from Anhilvada to Ashaval in 1411 CE; as was custom, the city was subsequently renamed Ahmedabad after the Sultan. [31]
Early history
[ edit ]
The area around Ahmedabad has been inhabited since the 11th century, when it was known as Ashaval . [32] At that time, Karna , the Chaulukya (Solanki) ruler of Anhilwara (modern Patan ), waged a successful war against the Bhil king of Ashaval, [33] and established a city called Karnavati on the banks of the Sabarmati. [34] Solanki rule lasted until the 13th century, when Gujarat came under the control of the Vaghela dynasty of Dholka . Gujarat subsequently came under the control of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century. However, by the earlier 15th century, the local Muslim governor Zafar Khan Muzaffar established his independence from the Delhi Sultanate and crowned himself Sultan of Gujarat as Muzaffar Shah I , thereby founding the Muzaffarid dynasty . [35] [36] [37] In 1411, the area came under the control of his grandson, Sultan Ahmed Shah , who selected the forested area along the banks of the Sabarmati river for his new capital. He laid the foundation of a new walled city near Karnavati and named it Ahmedabad after himself. [38] [39] According to other versions, he named the city after four Muslim saints in the area who all had the name Ahmed. [40] Ahmed Shah I laid the foundation of the city on 26 February 1411 [41] (at 1.20 pm, Thursday, the second day of Dhu al-Qi'dah , Hijri year 813 [42] ) at Manek Burj . Manek Burj is named after the legendary 15th-century Hindu saint, Maneknath , who intervened to help Ahmed Shah I build Bhadra Fort in 1411. [38] [43] [44] [45] Ahmed Shah I chose it as the new capital on 4 March 1411. [46] Chandan and Rajesh Nath, 13th generation descendants of Saint Maneknath, perform puja and hoist the flag on Manek Burj on Ahmedabad's foundation day and for the Vijayadashami festival every year. [38] [44] [47] [48]
City Walls of Ahmedabad, 1866
In 1487, Mahmud Begada , the grandson of Ahmed Shah, fortified the city with an outer wall 10 km (6.2 mi) in circumference and consisting of twelve gates , 189 bastions, and over 6,000 battlements. [49] In 1535 Humayun briefly occupied Ahmedabad after capturing Champaner when the ruler of Gujarat, Bahadur Shah , fled to Diu . [50] Ahmedabad was then reoccupied by the Muzaffarid dynasty until 1573 when Gujarat was conquered by the Mughal emperor Akbar . During the Mughal reign, Ahmedabad became one of the Empire's thriving centres of trade, mainly in textiles, which were exported as far as Europe. The Mughal ruler Shah Jahan spent the prime of his life in the city, sponsoring the construction of the Moti Shahi Mahal in Shahibaug . The Deccan Famine of 1630–32 affected the city, as did famines in 1650 and 1686. [51] Ahmedabad remained the provincial headquarters of the Mughals until 1758, when they surrendered the city to the Marathas . [52]
Modern history
[ edit ]
A market scene in Ahmedabad, 1901.
During the period of Maratha governance, the city became the centre of a conflict between the Peshwa of Poona and the Gaekwad of Baroda . [53] In 1780, during the First Anglo-Maratha War , a British force under James Hartley stormed and captured Ahmedabad, but it was handed back to the Marathas at the end of the war. The British East India Company took over the city in 1818 during the Third Anglo-Maratha War . [40] A military cantonment was established in 1824 and a municipal government in 1858. [40] Incorporated into the Bombay Presidency during British rule , Ahmedabad became one of the most important cities in the Gujarat region. In 1864, a railway link between Ahmedabad and Mumbai (then Bombay) was established by the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway (BB&CI), enabling traffic and trade between northern and southern India via the city. [40] Over time, the city established itself as the home of a developing textile industry, which earned it the nickname "" Manchester of the East"". [54]
Ahmedabad and its environs, ca 1914
The Indian independence movement developed roots in the city when Mahatma Gandhi established two ashrams – the Kochrab Ashram near Paldi in 1915 and the Satyagraha Ashram (now Sabarmati Ashram ) on the banks of the Sabarmati in 1917 – which would become centres of nationalist activities. [40] [55] During the mass protests against the Rowlatt Act in 1919, textile workers burned down 51 government buildings across the city in protest at a British attempt to extend wartime regulations after the First World War . In the 1920s, textile workers and teachers went on strike, demanding civil rights and better pay and working conditions. In 1930, Gandhi initiated the Salt Satyagraha from Ahmedabad by embarking from his ashram on the Dandi Salt March . The city's administration and economic institutions were rendered inoperative in the early 1930s by the large numbers of people who took to the streets in peaceful protests, and again in 1942 during the Quit India Movement .
Post-Independence
[ edit ]
Following independence and the partition of India in 1947, the city was scarred by the intense communal violence that broke out between Hindus and Muslims in 1947. Ahmedabad was the focus of settlement by Hindu migrants from Pakistan, [56] who expanded the city's population and transformed its demographics and economy.
By 1960, Ahmedabad had become a metropolis with a population of slightly under half a million people, with classical and colonial European-style buildings lining the city's thoroughfares. [57] It was chosen as the capital of Gujarat after the partition of the State of Bombay on 1 May 1960. [58] During this period, a large number of educational and research institutions were founded in the city, making it a centre for higher education , science, and technology. [59] Ahmedabad's economic base became more diverse with the establishment of heavy and chemical industry during the same period. Many countries sought to emulate India's economic planning strategy and one of them, South Korea , copied Ahmedabad's second ""Five-Year Plan"". [60] Post independence Ahmedabad has seen development in manufacturing and infrastructure. [61] [62]
Sabarmati Ashram , established by Mahatma Gandhi
In the late 1970s, the capital shifted to the newly built city of Gandhinagar . This marked the start of a long period of decline in Ahmedabad, marked by a lack of development. The 1974 Navnirman agitation – a protest against a 20% hike in the hostel food fees at the L.D. College of Engineering in Ahmedabad – snowballed into a movement to remove Chimanbhai Patel , then chief minister of Gujarat. [63] In the 1980s, a reservation policy was introduced in the country, which led to anti-reservation protests in 1981 and 1985. The protests witnessed violent clashes between people belonging to various castes . [64] The city was considerably impacted by the 2001 Gujarat earthquake ; up to 50 multi-storey buildings collapsed, killing 752 people and causing much damage. [65] The following year, a three-day period of violence between Hindus and Muslims in the western Indian state of Gujarat, known as the 2002 Gujarat riots , spread to Ahmedabad; in eastern Chamanpura , 69 people were killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre on 28 February 2002. [66] Refugee camps were set up around the city, housing 50,000 Muslims, as well as some small Hindu camps. [67]
The 2008 Ahmedabad bombings , a series of seventeen bomb blasts, killed and injured several people. [68] The terrorist group Harkat-ul-Jihad claimed responsibility for the attacks. [69]
Ahmedabad is one of few cities in India that has hosted the premiers of major economies such as the US, China, and Canada. On 24 February 2020, President Donald Trump became the first US president to visit the city. The event was named Namaste Trump . Earlier, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited the city. [70] [71] [72]

Indus Valley Civilisation, at peak phase (2600–1900 BCE)
Anatomically modern humans first arrived on the Indian subcontinent between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago. [1] The earliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years ago. Sedentariness began in South Asia around 7000 BCE; by 4500 BCE, settled life had spread, [2] and gradually evolved into the Indus Valley Civilisation , one of three early cradles of civilisation in the Old World , [3] [4] which flourished between 2500 BCE and 1900 BCE in present-day Pakistan and north-western India. Early in the second millennium BCE, persistent drought caused the population of the Indus Valley to scatter from large urban centres to villages. Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration . The Vedic Period of the Vedic people in northern India (1500–500 BCE) was marked by the composition of their extensive collections of hymns ( Vedas ). The social structure was loosely stratified via the varna system , incorporated into the highly evolved present-day Jāti system. The pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain . Around 600 BCE, a new, interregional culture arose; then, small chieftaincies ( janapadas ) were consolidated into larger states ( mahajanapadas ). Second urbanization took place, which came with the rise of new ascetic movements and religious concepts, [5] including the rise of Jainism and Buddhism . The latter was synthesized with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, giving rise to Hinduism .
Indian cultural influence ( Greater India )
Timeline of Indian history
Chandragupta Maurya overthrew the Nanda Empire and established the first great empire in ancient India, the Maurya Empire . India's Mauryan king Ashoka is widely recognised for his historical acceptance of Buddhism and his attempts to spread nonviolence and peace across his empire. The Maurya Empire would collapse in 185 BCE, on the assassination of the then-emperor Brihadratha by his general Pushyamitra Shunga . Shunga would form the Shunga Empire in the north and north-east of the subcontinent, while the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom would claim the north-west and found the Indo-Greek Kingdom . Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties, including the Gupta Empire , in the 4th to 6th centuries CE. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence is known as the Classical or Golden Age of India . Aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion spread to much of Asia, which led to the establishment of Indianised kingdoms in the region, forming Greater India . [6] [5] The most significant event between the 7th and 11th centuries was the Tripartite struggle centred on Kannauj . Southern India saw the rise of multiple imperial powers from the middle of the fifth century. The Chola dynasty conquered southern India in the 11th century. In the early medieval period, Indian mathematics , including Hindu numerals , influenced the development of mathematics and astronomy in the Arab world , including the creation of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system . [7]
Islamic conquests made limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Sindh as early as the 8th century, [8] followed by the invasions of Mahmud Ghazni . [9] The Delhi Sultanate , established in 1206 by Central Asian Turks, ruled much of northern India in the 14th century. It was governed by various Turkic and Afghan dynasties, including the Indo-Turkic Tughlaqs . [10] [11] The empire declined in the late 14th century following the invasions of Timur [12] and saw the advent of the Malwa , Gujarat , and Bahmani sultanates, the last of which split in 1518 into the five Deccan sultanates . The wealthy Bengal Sultanate also emerged as a major power, lasting over three centuries. [13] During this period, multiple strong Hindu kingdoms, notably the Vijayanagara Empire and Rajput states , emerged and played significant roles in shaping the cultural and political landscape of India.
The early modern period began in the 16th century, when the Mughal Empire conquered most of the Indian subcontinent, [14] signaling the proto-industrialisation , becoming the biggest global economy and manufacturing power. [15] [16] [17] The Mughals suffered a gradual decline in the early 18th century, largely due to the rising power of the Marathas , who took control of extensive regions of the Indian subcontinent, and numerous Afghan invasions . [18] [19] [20] The East India Company , acting as a sovereign force on behalf of the British government , gradually acquired control of huge areas of India between the middle of the 18th and the middle of the 19th centuries. Policies of company rule in India led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . India was afterwards ruled directly by the British Crown , in the British Raj . After World War I , a nationwide struggle for independence was launched by the Indian National Congress , led by Mahatma Gandhi . Later, the All-India Muslim League would advocate for a separate Muslim-majority nation state . The British Indian Empire was partitioned in August 1947 into the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan , each gaining its independence.

Main article: South Asian Stone Age
Hominin expansion from Africa is estimated to have reached the Indian subcontinent approximately two million years ago, and possibly as early as 2.2 million years ago. [24] [25] [26] This dating is based on the known presence of Homo erectus in Indonesia by 1.8 million years ago and in East Asia by 1.36 million years ago, as well as the discovery of stone tools at Riwat in Pakistan . [25] [27] Although some older discoveries have been claimed, the suggested dates, based on the dating of fluvial sediments , have not been independently verified. [26] [28]
The oldest hominin fossil remains in the Indian subcontinent are those of Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis , from the Narmada Valley in central India, and are dated to approximately half a million years ago. [25] [28] Older fossil finds have been claimed, but are considered unreliable. [28] Reviews of archaeological evidence have suggested that occupation of the Indian subcontinent by hominins was sporadic until approximately 700,000 years ago, and was geographically widespread by approximately 250,000 years ago. [28] [26]
According to a historical demographer of South Asia, Tim Dyson:
Modern human beings—Homo sapiens—originated in Africa. Then, intermittently, sometime between 60,000 and 80,000 years ago, tiny groups of them began to enter the north-west of the Indian subcontinent. It seems likely that initially they came by way of the coast. It is virtually certain that there were Homo sapiens in the subcontinent 55,000 years ago, even though the earliest fossils that have been found of them date to only about 30,000 years before the present. [29]
According to Michael D. Petraglia and Bridget Allchin :
Y-Chromosome and Mt-DNA data support the colonisation of South Asia by modern humans originating in Africa. ... Coalescence dates for most non-European populations average to between 73–55 ka. [30]
Historian of South Asia, Michael H. Fisher , states:
Scholars estimate that the first successful expansion of the Homo sapiens range beyond Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula occurred from as early as 80,000 years ago to as late as 40,000 years ago, although there may have been prior unsuccessful emigrations. Some of their descendants extended the human range ever further in each generation, spreading into each habitable land they encountered. One human channel was along the warm and productive coastal lands of the Persian Gulf and northern Indian Ocean. Eventually, various bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and 35,000 years ago. [31]
Archaeological evidence has been interpreted to suggest the presence of anatomically modern humans in the Indian subcontinent 78,000–74,000 years ago, [32] although this interpretation is disputed. [33] [34] The occupation of South Asia by modern humans, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has turned it into a highly diverse one, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. [35]
According to Tim Dyson:
Genetic research has contributed to knowledge of the prehistory of the subcontinent's people in other respects. In particular, the level of genetic diversity in the region is extremely high. Indeed, only Africa's population is genetically more diverse. Related to this, there is strong evidence of 'founder' events in the subcontinent. By this is meant circumstances where a subgroup—such as a tribe—derives from a tiny number of 'original' individuals. Further, compared to most world regions, the subcontinent's people are relatively distinct in having practised comparatively high levels of endogamy. [35]
Neolithic
Mehrgarh site in Beluchistan , Pakistan
Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus River alluvium approximately 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. [2] [36] According to Tim Dyson: ""By 7,000 years ago agriculture was firmly established in Baluchistan... [and] slowly spread eastwards into the Indus valley."" Michael Fisher adds: [37]
The earliest discovered instance ... of well-established, settled agricultural society is at Mehrgarh in the hills between the Bolan Pass and the Indus plain (today in Pakistan) (see Map 3.1). From as early as 7000 BCE, communities there started investing increased labor in preparing the land and selecting, planting, tending, and harvesting particular grain-producing plants. They also domesticated animals, including sheep, goats, pigs, and oxen (both humped zebu [Bos indicus] and unhumped [Bos taurus]). Castrating oxen, for instance, turned them from mainly meat sources into domesticated draft-animals as well. [37]

Indus Valley Civilisation

Harappan Period at peak, c. 2600 - 1900 BCE
The Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent began around 3300 BCE.[ citation needed ] The Indus Valley region was one of three early cradles of civilisation in the Old World ; the Indus Valley civilisation was the most expansive, [3] and at its peak, may have had a population of over five million. [4]
The civilisation was primarily centred in modern-day Pakistan, in the Indus river basin, and secondarily in the Ghaggar-Hakra River basin. The mature Indus civilisation flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE, marking the beginning of urban civilisation on the Indian subcontinent. It included cities such as Harappa , Ganweriwal , and Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan, and Dholavira , Kalibangan , Rakhigarhi , and Lothal in modern-day India.

Inhabitants of the ancient Indus River valley, the Harappans, developed new techniques in metallurgy and handicraft, and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin. [39] The civilisation is noted for its cities built of brick, and its roadside drainage systems, and is thought to have had some kind of municipal organisation. The civilisation also developed an Indus script , the earliest of the ancient Indian scripts , which is presently undeciphered. [40] This is the reason why Harappan language is not directly attested, and its affiliation is uncertain. [41]

After the collapse of Indus Valley civilisation, the inhabitants migrated from the river valleys of Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra, towards the Himalayan foothills of Ganga-Yamuna basin. [42]
Ochre Coloured Pottery culture
During the 2nd millennium BCE, Ochre Coloured Pottery culture was in Ganga Yamuna Doab region. These were rural settlements with agriculture and hunting. They were using copper tools such as axes, spears, arrows, and swords, and had domesticated animals. [44]
Iron Age (c. 1800 – 200 BCE)
See also: Indo-Aryan peoples and Indo-Aryan migrations
Starting c. 1900 BCE, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration . [45] [46] The Vedic period is when the Vedas were composed of liturgical hymns from the Indo-Aryan people. The Vedic culture was located in part of north-west India, while other parts of India had a distinct cultural identity. Many regions of the Indian subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age in this period. [47]
The Vedic culture is described in the texts of Vedas , still sacred to Hindus, which were orally composed and transmitted in Vedic Sanskrit . The Vedas are some of the oldest extant texts in India. [48] The Vedic period, lasting from about 1500 to 500 BCE, [49] [50] contributed to the foundations of several cultural aspects of the Indian subcontinent.
Vedic society
An early 19th century manuscript in the Devanagari script of the Rigveda , originally transmitted orally [51]
Historians have analysed the Vedas to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab , and the upper Gangetic Plain . [47] The Peepal tree and cow were sanctified by the time of the Atharva Veda . [52] Many of the concepts of Indian philosophy espoused later, like dharma , trace their roots to Vedic antecedents. [53]
Early Vedic society is described in the Rigveda , the oldest Vedic text, believed to have been compiled during the 2nd millennium BCE, [54] [55] in the north-western region of the Indian subcontinent. [56] At this time, Aryan society consisted of predominantly tribal and pastoral groups, distinct from the Harappan urbanisation which had been abandoned. [57] The early Indo-Aryan presence probably corresponds, in part, to the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture in archaeological contexts. [58] [59]
At the end of the Rigvedic period, the Aryan society expanded from the north-western region of the Indian subcontinent into the western Ganges plain. It became increasingly agricultural and was socially organised around the hierarchy of the four varnas , or social classes. This social structure was characterised both by syncretising with the native cultures of northern India [60] but also eventually by the exclusion of some indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure. [61] During this period, many of the previous small tribal units and chiefdoms began to coalesce into Janapadas (monarchical, state-level polities). [62]
Sanskrit epics
Manuscript illustration of the Battle of Kurukshetra .
The Sanskrit epics Ramayana and Mahabharata were composed during this period. [63] The Mahabharata remains the longest single poem in the world. [64] Historians formerly postulated an ""epic age"" as the milieu of these two epic poems, but now recognise that the texts went through multiple stages of development over centuries. [65] The existing texts of these epics are believed to belong to the post-Vedic age, between c. 400 BCE and 400 CE. [65] [66]
Janapadas

Late Vedic era map showing the boundaries of Āryāvarta with Janapadas in northern India, beginning of Iron Age kingdoms in India – Kuru , Panchala , Kosala , Videha
The Iron Age in the Indian subcontinent from about 1200 BCE to the 6th century BCE is defined by the rise of Janapadas, which are realms , republics and kingdoms —notably the Iron Age Kingdoms of Kuru , Panchala , Kosala and Videha . [67] [68]
The Kuru Kingdom ( c. 1200–450 BCE) was the first state-level society of the Vedic period, corresponding to the beginning of the Iron Age in north-western India, around 1200–800 BCE, [69] as well as with the composition of the Atharvaveda . [70] The Kuru state organised the Vedic hymns into collections and developed the srauta ritual to uphold the social order. [70] Two key figures of the Kuru state were king Parikshit and his successor Janamejaya , who transformed this realm into the dominant political, social, and cultural power of northern India. [70] When the Kuru kingdom declined, the centre of Vedic culture shifted to their eastern neighbours, the Panchala kingdom. [70] The archaeological PGW (Painted Grey Ware) culture, which flourished in north-eastern India's Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh regions from about 1100 to 600 BCE, [58] is believed to correspond to the Kuru and Panchala kingdoms. [70] [71]
During the Late Vedic Period, the kingdom of Videha emerged as a new centre of Vedic culture, situated even farther to the East (in what is today Nepal and Bihar state); [59] reaching its prominence under the king Janaka , whose court provided patronage for Brahmin sages and philosophers such as Yajnavalkya , Aruni , and Gārgī Vāchaknavī . [72] The later part of this period corresponds with a consolidation of increasingly large states and kingdoms, called Mahajanapadas , across Northern India.
Second urbanisation (c. 600 – 200 BCE)
City of Kushinagar in the 5th century BCE according to a 1st-century BCE frieze in Sanchi Stupa 1 Southern Gate
The period between 800 and 200 BCE saw the formation of the Śramaṇa movement, from which Jainism and Buddhism originated. The first Upanishads were written during this period. After 500 BCE, the so-called ""second urbanisation"" [note 1] started, with new urban settlements arising at the Ganges plain. [73] The foundations for the ""second urbanisation"" were laid prior to 600 BCE, in the Painted Grey Ware culture of the Ghaggar-Hakra and Upper Ganges Plain; although most PGW sites were small farming villages, ""several dozen"" PGW sites eventually emerged as relatively large settlements that can be characterised as towns, the largest of which were fortified by ditches or moats and embankments made of piled earth with wooden palisades. [74]
The Central Ganges Plain, where Magadha gained prominence, forming the base of the Maurya Empire , was a distinct cultural area, [75] with new states arising after 500 BCE. [76] [77] It was influenced by the Vedic culture, [78] but differed markedly from the Kuru-Panchala region. [75] ""It was the area of the earliest known cultivation of rice in South Asia and by 1800 BCE was the location of an advanced Neolithic population associated with the sites of Chirand and Chechar"". [79] In this region, the Śramaṇic movements flourished, and Jainism and Buddhism originated. [73]
Buddhism and Jainism
Gautama Buddha 's cremation stupa, Kushinagar (Kushinara).
The time between 800 BCE and 400 BCE witnessed the composition of the earliest Upanishads , [80] [81] [82] which form the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism , and are also known as the Vedanta (conclusion of the Vedas ). [83]
The increasing urbanisation of India in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the rise of new ascetic or ""Śramaṇa movements"" which challenged the orthodoxy of rituals. [80] Mahavira ( c. 599–527 BCE), proponent of Jainism , and Gautama Buddha ( c. 563–483 BCE), founder of Buddhism, were the most prominent icons of this movement. Śramaṇa gave rise to the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of samsara , and the concept of liberation. [84] Buddha found a Middle Way that ameliorated the extreme asceticism found in the Śramaṇa religions. [85]
Around the same time, Mahavira (the 24th Tirthankara in Jainism) propagated a theology that was to later become Jainism. [86] However, Jain orthodoxy believes the teachings of the Tirthankaras predates all known time and scholars believe Parshvanatha (c. 872 – c. 772 BCE), accorded status as the 23rd Tirthankara, was a historical figure. The Vedas are believed to have documented a few Tirthankaras and an ascetic order similar to the Śramaṇa movement. [87]
Mahajanapadas
Main article: Mahajanapadas
The Mahajanapadas were sixteen powerful polities located mainly within the Indo-Gangetic Plain
The period from c. 600 BCE to c. 300 BCE featured the rise of the Mahajanapadas , sixteen powerful kingdoms and oligarchic republics in a belt stretching from Gandhara in the north-west to Bengal in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent—including parts of the trans- Vindhyan region. [88] Ancient Buddhist texts , like the Aṅguttara Nikāya , [89] make frequent reference to these sixteen great kingdoms and republics— Anga , Assaka , Avanti , Chedi , Gandhara , Kashi , Kamboja , Kosala , Kuru , Magadha , Malla , Matsya (or Machcha), Panchala , Surasena , Vṛji , and Vatsa . This period saw the second major rise of urbanism in India after the Indus Valley Civilisation . [90]
Early ""republics"" or gaṇasaṅgha , [91] such as Shakyas , Koliyas , Mallakas , and Licchavis had republican governments. Gaṇasaṅghas, [91] such as the Mallakas, centered in the city of Kusinagara , and the Vajjika League , centred in the city of Vaishali , existed as early as the 6th century BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century CE. [92] The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate clans of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the Licchavis . [93]
This period corresponds in an archaeological context to the Northern Black Polished Ware culture. Especially focused in the Central Ganges plain but also spreading across vast areas of the northern and central Indian subcontinent, this culture is characterised by the emergence of large cities with massive fortifications, significant population growth, increased social stratification, wide-ranging trade networks, construction of public architecture and water channels, specialised craft industries, a system of weights, punch-marked coins , and the introduction of writing in the form of Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts. [94] [95] The language of the gentry at that time was Sanskrit , while the languages of the general population of northern India are referred to as Prakrits .
Many of the sixteen kingdoms had merged into four major ones by the time of Gautama Buddha . These four were Vatsa, Avanti, Kosala, and Magadha. [90]

Magadha formed one of the sixteen Mahajanapadas ( Sanskrit : ""Great Realms"") or kingdoms in ancient India . The core of the kingdom was the area of Bihar south of the Ganges ; its first capital was Rajagriha (modern Rajgir) then Pataliputra (modern Patna ). Magadha expanded to include most of Bihar and Bengal with the conquest of Licchavi and Anga respectively, [96] followed by much of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Orissa. The ancient kingdom of Magadha is heavily mentioned in Jain and Buddhist texts. It is also mentioned in the Ramayana , Mahabharata and Puranas . [97] The earliest reference to the Magadha people occurs in the Atharva-Veda where they are found listed along with the Angas , Gandharis , and Mujavats. Magadha played an important role in the development of Jainism and Buddhism . Republican communities (such as the community of Rajakumara) are merged into Magadha kingdom. Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas. Their administrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions.
Early sources, from the Buddhist Pāli Canon , the Jain Agamas and the Hindu Puranas , mention Magadha being ruled by the Pradyota dynasty and Haryanka dynasty ( c. 544–413 BCE) for some 200 years, c. 600–413 BCE. King Bimbisara of the Haryanka dynasty led an active and expansive policy, conquering Anga in what is now eastern Bihar and West Bengal . King Bimbisara was overthrown and killed by his son, Prince Ajatashatru , who continued the expansionist policy of Magadha. During this period, Gautama Buddha , the founder of Buddhism, lived much of his life in the Magadha kingdom. He attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya , gave his first sermon in Sarnath and the first Buddhist council was held in Rajgriha. [98] The Haryanka dynasty was overthrown by the Shaishunaga dynasty ( c. 413–345 BCE). The last Shishunaga ruler, Kalasoka, was assassinated by Mahapadma Nanda in 345 BCE, the first of the so-called Nine Nandas (Mahapadma Nanda and his eight sons).
Nanda Empire and Alexander's campaign
See also: Indian campaign of Alexander the Great
The Nanda Empire ( c. 345–322 BCE), at its peak, extended from Bengal in the east, to the Punjab in the west and as far south as the Vindhya Range . [99] The Nanda dynasty built on the foundations laid by their Haryanka and Shishunaga predecessors. [100] Nanda empire have built a vast army, consisting of 200,000 infantry , 20,000 cavalry , 2,000 war chariots and 3,000 war elephants (at the lowest estimates). [101] [102]
Maurya Empire

The Maurya Empire (322–185 BCE) unified most of the Indian subcontinent into one state, and was the largest empire ever to exist on the Indian subcontinent. [103] At its greatest extent, the Mauryan Empire stretched to the north up to the natural boundaries of the Himalayas and to the east into what is now Assam . To the west, it reached beyond modern Pakistan, to the Hindu Kush mountains in what is now Afghanistan. The empire was established by Chandragupta Maurya assisted by Chanakya ( Kautilya ) in Magadha (in modern Bihar ) when he overthrew the Nanda Empire . [104]
Chandragupta rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India, and by 317 BCE the empire had fully occupied north-western India. The Mauryan Empire defeated Seleucus I , founder of the Seleucid Empire , during the Seleucid–Mauryan war , thus gained additional territory west of the Indus River. Chandragupta's son Bindusara succeeded to the throne around 297 BCE. By the time he died in c. 272 BCE, a large part of the Indian subcontinent was under Mauryan suzerainty. However, the region of Kalinga (around modern day Odisha ) remained outside Mauryan control, perhaps interfering with trade with the south. [105]
The Mauryan carved door of Lomas Rishi , one of the Barabar Caves , c. 250 BCE
Bindusara was succeeded by Ashoka , whose reign lasted until his death in about 232 BCE. [106] His campaign against the Kalingans in about 260 BCE, though successful, led to immense loss of life and misery. This led Ashoka to shun violence, and subsequently to embrace Buddhism. [105] The empire began to decline after his death and the last Mauryan ruler, Brihadratha , was assassinated by Pushyamitra Shunga to establish the Shunga Empire . [106]
Under Chandragupta Maurya and his successors, internal and external trade, agriculture, and economic activities all thrived and expanded across India thanks to the creation of a single efficient system of finance, administration, and security. The Mauryans built the Grand Trunk Road , one of Asia's oldest and longest major roads connecting the Indian subcontinent with Central Asia. [107] After the Kalinga War , the Empire experienced nearly half a century of peace and security under Ashoka. Mauryan India also enjoyed an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of scientific knowledge. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of Jainism increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and non-violence across India.[ citation needed ] Ashoka sponsored Buddhist missions across the Indo-Mediterranean , into Sri Lanka , Southeast Asia , West Asia , North Africa , and Mediterranean Europe . [108]
The Arthashastra written by Chanakya and the Edicts of Ashoka are the primary written records of the Mauryan times. Archaeologically, this period falls in the era of Northern Black Polished Ware . The Mauryan Empire was based on a modern and efficient economy and society in which the sale of merchandise was closely regulated by the government. [109] Although there was no banking in the Mauryan society, usury was customary. A significant amount of written records on slavery are found, suggesting a prevalence thereof. [110] During this period, a high-quality steel called Wootz steel was developed in south India and was later exported to China and Arabia. [111]
Sangam period
Ilango Adigal , author of Silappatikaram , one of the five great epics of Tamil literature . [112]
During the Sangam period Tamil literature flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 4th century CE. Three Tamil dynasties, collectively known as the Three Crowned Kings of Tamilakam : Chera dynasty , Chola dynasty , and the Pandya dynasty ruled parts of southern India. [113]
The Sangam literature deals with the history, politics, wars, and culture of the Tamil people of this period. [114] Unlike Sanskrit writers who were mostly Brahmins, Sangam writers came from diverse classes and social backgrounds and were mostly non-Brahmins. [115]
Around c. 300 BCE – c. 200 CE, Pathupattu , an anthology of ten mid-length book collections, which is considered part of Sangam Literature , were composed; the composition of eight anthologies of poetic works Ettuthogai as well as the composition of eighteen minor poetic works Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku ; while Tolkāppiyam , the earliest grammarian work in the Tamil language was developed. [116] Also, during Sangam period, two of the Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature were composed. Ilango Adigal composed Silappatikaram , which is a non-religious work, that revolves around Kannagi , [117] and Manimekalai , composed by Chithalai Chathanar , is a sequel to Silappatikaram, and tells the story of the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi , who became a Buddhist Bhikkhuni . [118] [119]

The time between the Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BCE and the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE is referred to as the ""Classical"" period of India. [122] The Gupta Empire (4th–6th century) is regarded as the Golden Age of India , although a host of kingdoms ruled over India in these centuries. Also, the Sangam literature flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE in southern India. [123] During this period, India's economy is estimated to have been the largest in the world, having between one-third and one-quarter of the world's wealth, from 1 CE to 1000 CE. [124] [125]

Shunga Empire

The Shungas originated from Magadha , and controlled large areas of the central and eastern Indian subcontinent from around 187 to 78 BCE. The dynasty was established by Pushyamitra Shunga , who overthrew the last Maurya emperor . Its capital was Pataliputra , but later emperors, such as Bhagabhadra , also held court at Vidisha , modern Besnagar . [126]
Pushyamitra Shunga ruled for 36 years and was succeeded by his son Agnimitra . There were ten Shunga rulers. However, after the death of Agnimitra, the empire rapidly disintegrated; [127] inscriptions and coins indicate that much of northern and central India consisted of small kingdoms and city-states that were independent of any Shunga hegemony. [128] The empire is noted for its numerous wars with both foreign and indigenous powers. They fought with the Mahameghavahana dynasty of Kalinga , Satavahana dynasty of Deccan , the Indo-Greeks , and possibly the Panchalas and Mitras of Mathura .
Art, education, philosophy, and other forms of learning flowered during this period including architectural monuments such as the Stupa at Bharhut and the renowned Great Stupa at Sanchi . The Shunga rulers helped to establish the tradition of royal sponsorship of learning and art. The script used by the empire was a variant of Brahmi and was used to write the Sanskrit language . The Shunga Empire played an imperative role in patronising Indian culture at a time when some of the most important developments in Hindu thought were taking place.

The Śātavāhanas were based from Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh as well as Junnar ( Pune ) and Prathisthan ( Paithan ) in Maharashtra . The territory of the empire covered large parts of India from the 1st century BCE onward. The Sātavāhanas started out as feudatories to the Mauryan dynasty , but declared independence with its decline.
The Sātavāhanas are known for their patronage of Hinduism and Buddhism, which resulted in Buddhist monuments from Ellora (a UNESCO World Heritage Site ) to Amaravati . They were one of the first Indian states to issue coins with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India.
They had to compete with the Shunga Empire and then the Kanva dynasty of Magadha to establish their rule. Later, they played a crucial role to protect large part of India against foreign invaders like the Sakas , Yavanas and Pahlavas . In particular, their struggles with the Western Kshatrapas went on for a long time. The notable rulers of the Satavahana Dynasty Gautamiputra Satakarni and Sri Yajna Sātakarni were able to defeat the foreign invaders like the Western Kshatrapas and to stop their expansion. In the 3rd century CE, the empire was split into smaller states. [129]
Trade and travels to India
Further information: Silk Road transmission of Buddhism
Silk Road and Spice trade , ancient trade routes that linked India with the Old World ; carried goods and ideas between the ancient civilisations of the Old World and India. The land routes are marked as red, and the water routes are marked as blue.
The spice trade in Kerala attracted traders from all over the Old World to India. India's Southwest coastal port Muziris had established itself as a major spice trade centre from as early as 3,000 BCE, according to Sumerian records . Jewish traders arrived in Kochi , Kerala, India as early as 562 BCE. [130] The Greco-Roman world followed by trading along the incense route and the Roman-India routes . [131] During the 2nd century BCE Greek and Indian ships met to trade at Arabian ports such as Aden . [132] During the first millennium, the sea routes to India were controlled by the Indians and Ethiopians that became the maritime trading power of the Red Sea .
Indian merchants involved in spice trade took Indian cuisine to Southeast Asia, where spice mixtures and curries became popular with the native inhabitants. [133] Buddhism entered China through the Silk Road in the 1st or 2nd century CE. [134] Hindu and Buddhist religious establishments of South and Southeast Asia came to be centres of production and commerce as they accumulated capital donated by patrons. They engaged in estate management, craftsmanship, and trade. Buddhism in particular travelled alongside the maritime trade, promoting literacy, art, and the use of coinage. [135]

Depiction of the Buddha in Kanishka's coinage, Mathura art , 2nd century CE
The Kushan Empire expanded out of what is now Afghanistan into the northwest of the Indian subcontinent under the leadership of their first emperor, Kujula Kadphises , about the middle of the 1st century CE. The Kushans were possibly a Tocharian speaking tribe, [136] one of five branches of the Yuezhi confederation. [137] [138] By the time of his grandson, Kanishka the Great , the empire spread to encompass much of Afghanistan , [139] and then the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent. [140]
Emperor Kanishka was a great patron of Buddhism; however, as Kushans expanded southward, the deities of their later coinage came to reflect its new Hindu majority. [141] [142] Historian Vincent Smith said about Kanishka:
He played the part of a second Ashoka in the history of Buddhism. [143]
The empire linked the Indian Ocean maritime trade with the commerce of the Silk Road through the Indus valley, encouraging long-distance trade, particularly between China and Rome . The Kushans brought new trends to the budding and blossoming Gandhara art and Mathura art , which reached its peak during Kushan rule. [144] The period of peace under Kushan rule is known as Pax Kushana . By the 3rd century, their empire in India was disintegrating and their last known great emperor was Vasudeva I . [145] [146]

The Gupta period was noted for cultural creativity, especially in literature, architecture, sculpture, and painting. [147] The Gupta period produced scholars such as Kalidasa , Aryabhata , Varahamihira , Vishnu Sharma , and Vatsyayana . The Gupta period marked a watershed of Indian culture: the Guptas performed Vedic sacrifices to legitimise their rule, but they also patronised Buddhism, an alternative to Brahmanical orthodoxy. The military exploits of the first three rulers – Chandragupta I , Samudragupta , and Chandragupta II – brought much of India under their leadership. [148] Science and political administration reached new heights during the Gupta era. Strong trade ties also made the region an important cultural centre and established it as a base that would influence nearby kingdoms and regions. [149] [150] The period of peace under Gupta rule is known as Pax Gupta .
The latter Guptas successfully resisted the northwestern kingdoms until the arrival of the Alchon Huns , who established themselves in Afghanistan by the first half of the 5th century CE, with their capital at Bamiyan . [151] However, much of the southern India including Deccan were largely unaffected by these events. [152] [153]
Vakataka Empire
Main article: Vakataka Empire
The Vākāṭaka Empire originated from the Deccan in the mid-third century CE. Their state is believed to have extended from the southern edges of Malwa and Gujarat in the north to the Tungabhadra River in the south as well as from the Arabian Sea in the western to the edges of Chhattisgarh in the east. They were the most important successors of the Satavahanas in the Deccan , contemporaneous with the Guptas in northern India and succeeded by the Vishnukundina dynasty .
The Vakatakas are noted for having been patrons of the arts, architecture and literature. The rock-cut Buddhist viharas and chaityas of Ajanta Caves (a UNESCO World Heritage Site ) were built under the patronage of Vakataka emperor, Harishena . [154] [155]

Kamarupa Kingdom
Main article: Kamarupa Kingdom
Copper Plate Seal of Kamarupa Kings at Madan Kamdev ruins.
Samudragupta 's 4th-century Allahabad pillar inscription mentions Kamarupa ( Western Assam ) [156] and Davaka (Central Assam) [157] as frontier kingdoms of the Gupta Empire. Davaka was later absorbed by Kamarupa, which grew into a large kingdom that spanned from Karatoya river to near present Sadiya and covered the entire Brahmaputra valley, North Bengal , parts of Bangladesh and, at times Purnea and parts of West Bengal . [158]
Ruled by three dynasties Varmanas (c. 350–650 CE), Mlechchha dynasty (c. 655–900 CE) and Kamarupa-Palas (c. 900–1100 CE), from their capitals in present-day Guwahati ( Pragjyotishpura ), Tezpur ( Haruppeswara ) and North Gauhati ( Durjaya ) respectively. All three dynasties claimed their descent from Narakasura .[ citation needed ] In the reign of the Varman king, Bhaskar Varman (c. 600–650 CE), the Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the region and recorded his travels. Later, after weakening and disintegration (after the Kamarupa-Palas), the Kamarupa tradition was somewhat extended until c. 1255 CE by the Lunar I (c. 1120–1185 CE) and Lunar II (c. 1155–1255 CE) dynasties. [159] The Kamarupa kingdom came to an end in the middle of the 13th century when the Khen dynasty under Sandhya of Kamarupanagara (North Guwahati), moved his capital to Kamatapur (North Bengal) after the invasion of Muslim Turks, and established the Kamata kingdom . [160]
Pallava Empire

The Pallavas , during the 4th to 9th centuries were, alongside the Guptas of the North , great patronisers of Sanskrit development in the South of the Indian subcontinent. The Pallava reign saw the first Sanskrit inscriptions in a script called Grantha . [161] Early Pallavas had different connexions to Southeast Asian countries. The Pallavas used Dravidian architecture to build some very important Hindu temples and academies in Mamallapuram , Kanchipuram and other places; their rule saw the rise of great poets. The practice of dedicating temples to different deities came into vogue followed by fine artistic temple architecture and sculpture style of Vastu Shastra . [162]
Pallavas reached the height of power during the reign of Mahendravarman I (571–630 CE) and Narasimhavarman I (630–668 CE) and dominated the Telugu and northern parts of the Tamil region until the end of the 9th century. [163]
Kadamba Empire

Kadambas originated from Karnataka , was founded by Mayurasharma in 345 CE which at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions. King Mayurasharma defeated the armies of Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with help of some native tribes. The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma , a notable ruler with whom the kings of Gupta Dynasty of northern India cultivated marital alliances. The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy. The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires, for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties ( Kadambas of Goa , Kadambas of Halasi and Kadambas of Hangal ).
Empire of Harsha
Main articles: Harsha and Pushyabhuti dynasty
Harsha ruled northern India from 606 to 647 CE. He was the son of Prabhakarvardhana and the younger brother of Rajyavardhana , who were members of the Vardhana dynasty and ruled Thanesar , in present-day Haryana .
Coin of Emperor Harsha , c. 606–647 CE. [164]
After the downfall of the prior Gupta Empire in the middle of the 6th century, North India reverted to smaller republics and monarchical states. The power vacuum resulted in the rise of the Vardhanas of Thanesar, who began uniting the republics and monarchies from the Punjab to central India. After the death of Harsha's father and brother, representatives of the empire crowned Harsha emperor in April 606 CE, giving him the title of Maharaja. [165] At the peak, his Empire covered much of North and Northwestern India, extended East until Kamarupa , and South until Narmada River ; and eventually made Kannauj (in present Uttar Pradesh ) his capital, and ruled until 647 CE. [166]
The peace and prosperity that prevailed made his court a centre of cosmopolitanism, attracting scholars, artists and religious visitors. [166] During this time, Harsha converted to Buddhism from Surya worship. [167] The Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the court of Harsha and wrote a very favourable account of him, praising his justice and generosity. [166] His biography Harshacharita (""Deeds of Harsha"") written by Sanskrit poet Banabhatta , describes his association with Thanesar and the palace with a two-storied Dhavalagriha (White Mansion). [168] [169]
Early medieval period (c. 650 – 1200)
Main articles: Medieval India , Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent , and Tripartite Struggle
Early medieval India began after the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE. [122] This period also covers the ""Late Classical Age"" of Hinduism, which began after the collapse of the Empire of Harsha in the 7th century, [170] and ended in the 13th century with the rise of the Delhi Sultanate in Northern India; [171] the beginning of Imperial Kannauj , leading to the Tripartite struggle ; and the end of the Later Cholas with the death of Rajendra Chola III in 1279 in Southern India; however some aspects of the Classical period continued until the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in the south around the 17th century.
From the fifth century to the thirteenth, Śrauta sacrifices declined, and support for Shaivism , Vaishnavism and Shaktism expanded in royal courts, while the support for Buddhism declined. [172] Lack of appeal among the rural masses, who instead embraced Brahmanical Hinduism formed in the Hindu synthesis , and dwindling financial support from trading communities and royal elites, were major factors in the decline of Buddhism. [173]
In the 7th century, Kumārila Bhaṭṭa formulated his school of Mimamsa philosophy and defended the position on Vedic rituals. [174]
From the 8th to the 10th century, three dynasties contested for control of northern India: the Gurjara Pratiharas of Malwa, the Palas of Bengal, and the Rashtrakutas of the Deccan. The Sena dynasty would later assume control of the Pala Empire; the Gurjara Pratiharas fragmented into various states, notably the Kingdom of Malwa , the Kingdom of Bundelkhand , the Kingdom of Dahala , the Tomaras of Haryana , and the Kingdom of Sambhar , these states were some of the earliest Rajput kingdoms ; [175] while the Rashtrakutas were annexed by the Western Chalukyas . [176] During this period, the Chaulukya dynasty emerged; the Chaulukyas constructed the Dilwara Temples , Modhera Sun Temple , Rani ki vav [177] in the style of Māru-Gurjara architecture , and their capital Anhilwara (modern Patan, Gujarat ) was one of the largest cities in the Indian subcontinent, with the population estimated at 100,000 in c. 1000.
The Chola Empire emerged as a major power during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I who successfully invaded parts of Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka in the 11th century. [178] Lalitaditya Muktapida (r. 724–760) was an emperor of the Kashmiri Karkoṭa dynasty , which exercised influence in northwestern India from 625 until 1003, and was followed by Lohara dynasty . Kalhana in his Rajatarangini credits king Lalitaditya with leading an aggressive military campaign in Northern India and Central Asia. [179] [180] [181]
The Hindu Shahi dynasty ruled portions of eastern Afghanistan, northern Pakistan, and Kashmir from the mid-7th century to the early 11th century. While in Odisha, the Eastern Ganga Empire rose to power; noted for the advancement of Hindu architecture , most notable being Jagannath Temple and Konark Sun Temple , as well as being patrons of art and literature.

Map of the Later Guptas
The Later Gupta dynasty ruled the Magadha region in eastern India between the 6th and 7th centuries AD. The Later Guptas succeeded the imperial Guptas as the rulers of Magadha, but there is no evidence connecting the two dynasties; these appear to be two distinct families. [182] The Later Guptas are so-called because the names of their rulers ended with the suffix ""-gupta"", which they might have adopted to portray themselves as the legitimate successors of the imperial Guptas. [183]
Chalukya Empire
Main article: Chalukya dynasty
The Chalukya Empire ruled large parts of southern and central India between the 6th and the 12th centuries, as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the ""Badami Chalukyas"", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami ) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II . The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka . The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada Rivers . The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called ""Chalukyan architecture"". The Chalukya dynasty ruled parts of southern and central India from Badami in Karnataka between 550 and 750, and then again from Kalyani between 970 and 1190.

Rashtrakuta Empire
Main article: Rashtrakuta Empire
Founded by Dantidurga around 753, [184] the Rashtrakuta Empire ruled from its capital at Manyakheta for almost two centuries. [185] At its peak, the Rashtrakutas ruled from the Ganges-Yamuna Doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a fruitful time of architectural and literary achievements. [186] [187]
The early rulers of this dynasty were Hindu, but the later rulers were strongly influenced by Jainism. [188] Govinda III and Amoghavarsha were the most famous of the long line of able administrators produced by the dynasty. Amoghavarsha was also an author and wrote Kavirajamarga , the earliest known Kannada work on poetics. [185] [189] Architecture reached a milestone in the Dravidian style, the finest example of which is seen in the Kailasanath Temple at Ellora. Other important contributions are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka.
The Arab traveller Suleiman described the Rashtrakuta Empire as one of the four great Empires of the world. [190] The Rashtrakuta period marked the beginning of the golden age of southern Indian mathematics. The great south Indian mathematician Mahāvīra had a huge impact on medieval south Indian mathematicians. [191] The Rashtrakuta rulers also patronised men of letters in a variety of languages. [185]

The Gurjara-Pratiharas were instrumental in containing Arab armies moving east of the Indus River . Nagabhata I defeated the Arab army under Junaid and Tamin during the Umayyad campaigns in India . [192] Under Nagabhata II , the Gurjara-Pratiharas became the most powerful dynasty in northern India. He was succeeded by his son Ramabhadra , who ruled briefly before being succeeded by his son, Mihira Bhoja . Under Bhoja and his successor Mahendrapala I , the Pratihara Empire reached its peak of prosperity and power. By the time of Mahendrapala, its territory stretched from the border of Sindh in the west to Bihar in the east and from the Himalayas in the north to around the Narmada River in the south. [193] The expansion triggered a tripartite power struggle with the Rashtrakuta and Pala empires for control of the Indian subcontinent.

In 1097 AD, the Karnat dynasty of Mithila emerged on the Bihar/Nepal border area and maintained capitals in Darbhanga and Simraongadh . The dynasty was established by Nanyadeva , a military commander of Karnataka origin. Under this dynasty, the Maithili language started to develop with the first piece of Maithili literature, the Varna Ratnakara being produced in the 14th century by Jyotirishwar Thakur. The Karnats also carried out raids into Nepal . They fell in 1324 following the invasion of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq . [197] [198]
Pala Empire
Main article: Pala Empire
The Pala Empire was founded by Gopala I . [199] [200] [201] It was ruled by a Buddhist dynasty from Bengal. The Palas reunified Bengal after the fall of Shashanka 's Gauda Kingdom . [202]
The Palas were followers of the Mahayana and Tantric schools of Buddhism, [203] they also patronised Shaivism and Vaishnavism . [204] The empire reached its peak under Dharmapala and Devapala . Dharmapala is believed to have conquered Kanauj and extended his sway up to the farthest limits of India in the north-west. [204]
The Pala Empire can be considered as the golden era of Bengal. [205] Dharmapala founded the Vikramashila and revived Nalanda, [204] considered one of the first great universities in recorded history. Nalanda reached its height under the patronage of the Pala Empire. [205] [206] The Palas also built many viharas . They maintained close cultural and commercial ties with countries of Southeast Asia and Tibet . Sea trade added greatly to the prosperity of the Pala Empire.
Cholas
Chola Empire under Rajendra Chola , c. 1030
Medieval Cholas rose to prominence during the middle of the 9th century and established the greatest empire South India had seen. [207] They successfully united the South India under their rule and through their naval strength extended their influence in the Southeast Asian countries such as Srivijaya. [178] Under Rajaraja Chola I and his successors Rajendra Chola I , Rajadhiraja Chola , Virarajendra Chola and Kulothunga Chola I the dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in South Asia and South-East Asia. [208] [209] Rajendra Chola I's navies occupied the sea coasts from Burma to Vietnam, [210] the Andaman and Nicobar Islands , the Lakshadweep (Laccadive) islands, Sumatra , and the Malay Peninsula . The power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra Chola I undertook and by the occupation of cities of the maritime empire of Srivijaya in Southeast Asia, as well as by the repeated embassies to China. [211]
They dominated the political affairs of Sri Lanka for over two centuries through repeated invasions and occupation. They also had continuing trade contacts with the Arabs and the Chinese empire. [212] Rajaraja Chola I and his son Rajendra Chola I gave political unity to the whole of Southern India and established the Chola Empire as a respected sea power. [213] Under the Cholas, the South India reached new heights of excellence in art, religion and literature. In all of these spheres, the Chola period marked the culmination of movements that had begun in an earlier age under the Pallavas. Monumental architecture in the form of majestic temples and sculpture in stone and bronze reached a finesse never before achieved in India. [214]

Western Chalukya Empire
Main article: Western Chalukya Empire
The Western Chalukya Empire ruled most of the western Deccan , South India, between the 10th and 12th centuries. [216] Vast areas between the Narmada River in the north and Kaveri River in the south came under Chalukya control. [216] During this period the other major ruling families of the Deccan, the Hoysalas , the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri , the Kakatiya dynasty and the Southern Kalachuris , were subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only when the power of the Chalukya waned during the latter half of the 12th century. [217]
The Western Chalukyas developed an architectural style known today as a transitional style, an architectural link between the style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the later Hoysala empire. Most of its monuments are in the districts bordering the Tungabhadra River in central Karnataka. Well known examples are the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi , the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti, the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali, Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri, and the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi. [218] This was an important period in the development of fine arts in Southern India, especially in literature as the Western Chalukya kings encouraged writers in the native language of Kannada , and Sanskrit like the philosopher and statesman Basava and the great mathematician Bhāskara II .

Late medieval period (c. 1200 – 1526)
The late medieval period is marked by repeated invasions by Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, [221] [222] the rule of the Delhi Sultanate, and by the growth of other states, built upon military technology of the sultanate. [223]
Delhi Sultanate
Main article: Delhi Sultanate
The Delhi Sultanate was a series of successive Islamic states based in Delhi, ruled by several dynasties of varying origins. The polity ruled over large parts of the Indian subcontinent from the 13th to early 16th centuries. [224] The sultanate was founded in the 12th and 13th centuries by Central Asian Turks, who invaded parts of northern India and established the state atop former Hindu holdings. [225] The subsequent Mamluk dynasty of Delhi managed to conquer large areas of northern India. The Khalji dynasty conquered much of central India while forcing the principal Hindu kingdoms of South India to become vassal states . [224]
The sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance. The resulting ""Indo-Muslim"" fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing. It is surmised that the language of Urdu was born during the period of the Delhi Sultanate. The sultanate was the only Indo-Islamic state to enthrone one of the few female rulers in India, Razia Sultana ( r. 1236–1240).
While initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslim elites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing world system, drawing India into a wider international network, which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society. [226] However, the Delhi Sultanate also caused large-scale destruction and desecration of temples in the Indian subcontinent. [227]
The Mongol invasions of India were successfully repelled by the Delhi Sultanate during the rule of Alauddin Khalji . A major factor in their success was their Turkic Mamluk slave army, who were highly skilled in the same style of nomadic cavalry warfare as the Mongols. It is possible that the Mongol Empire may have expanded into India were it not for the Delhi Sultanate's role in repelling them. [228] By repeatedly repulsing the Mongol raiders, [229] the sultanate saved India from the devastation waged on West and Central Asia. Soldiers from that region and learned men and administrators fleeing Mongol invasions of Iran migrated into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. [228]
A Turco-Mongol conqueror from Central Asia, Timur (Tamerlane), attacked the reigning sultan Nasir-u Din Mehmud of the Tughlaq dynasty in Delhi. [230] The sultan's army was defeated on 17 December 1398. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins after Timur's army had killed and plundered for three days and nights. He ordered the whole city to be sacked except for the sayyids , scholars, and the ""other Muslims"" (artists); 100,000 war prisoners were said to have been put to death in one day. [231] The sultanate suffered significantly from the sacking of Delhi. Though revived briefly under the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties, it was but a shadow of the former. Lodi rule lasted in Delhi until the defeat of the last sultan, Ibrahim Khan Lodi , in 1526 to the forces of Babur . [232]

Vijayanagara Empire
Map of the Sangama dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire
The Vijayanagara Empire was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty , [233] which originated as a political heir of the Hoysala Empire , Kakatiya Empire , [234] and the Pandyan Empire . [235] The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the south Indian powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates . The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara , whose ruins surround present day Hampi , now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India. [236]
In the first two decades after the founding of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara (""master of the eastern and western seas""). By 1374 Bukka Raya I, successor to Harihara I, had defeated the chiefdom of Arcot , the Reddys of Kondavidu, and the Sultan of Madurai and had gained control over Goa in the west and the Tungabhadra-Krishna doab in the north. [237] [238]
Harihara II , the second son of Bukka Raya I, further consolidated the kingdom beyond the Krishna River and brought the whole of South India under the Vijayanagara umbrella. [239] The next ruler, Deva Raya I , emerged successful against the Gajapatis of Odisha and undertook important works of fortification and irrigation. [240] Italian traveller Niccolo de Conti wrote of him as the most powerful ruler of India. [241] Deva Raya II succeeded to the throne in 1424 and was possibly the most capable of the Sangama Dynasty rulers. [242] He quelled rebelling feudal lords as well as the Zamorin of Calicut and Quilon in the south. He invaded the island of Sri Lanka and became overlord of the kings of Burma at Pegu and Tanasserim . [243] [244] [245]
The Vijayanagara Emperors were tolerant of all religions and sects, as writings by foreign visitors show. [246] The kings used titles such as Gobrahamana Pratipalanacharya (literally, ""protector of cows and Brahmins"") and Hindurayasuratrana (lit, ""upholder of Hindu faith"") that testified to their intention of protecting Hinduism and yet were at the same time staunchly Islamicate in their court ceremonials and dress. [247] The empire's founders, Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, were devout Shaivas (worshippers of Shiva ), but made grants to the Vaishnava order of Sringeri with Vidyaranya as their patron saint, and designated Varaha (an avatar of Vishnu) as their emblem. [248] Nobles from Central Asia's Timurid kingdoms also came to Vijayanagara. [249] The later Saluva and Tuluva kings were Vaishnava by faith, but worshipped at the feet of Lord Virupaksha (Shiva) at Hampi as well as Lord Venkateshwara (Vishnu) at Tirupati . [250] A Sanskrit work, Jambavati Kalyanam by King Krishnadevaraya, called Lord Virupaksha Karnata Rajya Raksha Mani (""protective jewel of Karnata Empire""). [251] The kings patronised the saints of the dvaita order (philosophy of dualism) of Madhvacharya at Udupi . [252]

The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of Hindu temple construction. South Indian mathematics flourished under the protection of the Vijayanagara Empire in Kerala. The south Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama founded the famous Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics in the 14th century which produced a lot of great south Indian mathematicians like Parameshvara , Nilakantha Somayaji and Jyeṣṭhadeva . [255] Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. [256] The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. [257]
Vijayanagara went into decline after the defeat in the Battle of Talikota (1565). After the death of Aliya Rama Raya in the Battle of Talikota, Tirumala Deva Raya started the Aravidu dynasty , moved and founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the destroyed Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire. [258] Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons, and pursued a religious life until his death in 1578. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others. [259] [260] [261] During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara. These include the Mysore Kingdom , Keladi Nayaka , Nayaks of Madurai , Nayaks of Tanjore , Nayakas of Chitradurga and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee – all of which declared independence and went on to have a significant impact on the history of South India in the coming centuries. [259]

For two and a half centuries from the mid-13th century, politics in Northern India was dominated by the Delhi Sultanate , and in Southern India by the Vijayanagar Empire. However, there were other regional powers present as well. After fall of Pala Empire, the Chero dynasty ruled much of Eastern Uttar Pradesh , Bihar and Jharkhand from the 12th to the 18th centuries. [262] [263] [264] The Reddy dynasty successfully defeated the Delhi Sultanate and extended their rule from Cuttack in the north to Kanchi in the south, eventually being absorbed into the expanding Vijayanagara Empire. [265]
In the north, the Rajput kingdoms remained the dominant force in Western and Central India. The Mewar dynasty under Maharana Hammir defeated and captured Muhammad Tughlaq with the Bargujars as his main allies. Tughlaq had to pay a huge ransom and relinquish all of Mewar's lands. After this event, the Delhi Sultanate did not attack Chittor for a few hundred years. The Rajputs re-established their independence, and Rajput states were established as far east as Bengal and north into the Punjab . The Tomaras established themselves at Gwalior , and Man Singh Tomar reconstructed the Gwalior Fort . [266] During this period, Mewar emerged as the leading Rajput state; and Rana Kumbha expanded his kingdom at the expense of the Sultanates of Malwa and Gujarat . [266] [267] The next great Rajput ruler, Rana Sanga of Mewar, became the principal player in Northern India . His objectives grew in scope – he planned to conquer Delhi. But, his defeat in the Battle of Khanwa consolidated the new Mughal dynasty in India. [266] The Mewar dynasty under Maharana Udai Singh II faced further defeat by Mughal emperor Akbar , with their capital Chittor being captured. Due to this event, Udai Singh II founded Udaipur , which became the new capital of the Mewar kingdom . His son, Maharana Pratap of Mewar, firmly resisted the Mughals. Akbar sent many missions against him. He survived to ultimately gain control of all of Mewar, excluding the Chittor Fort . [268]
In the south, the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan, born from a rebellion in 1347 against the Tughlaq dynasty , [269] was the chief rival of Vijayanagara, and frequently created difficulties for them. [270] Starting in 1490, the Bahmani Sultanate's governors revolted, their independent states composing the five Deccan sultanates ; Ahmadnagar declared independence, followed by Bijapur and Berar in the same year; Golkonda became independent in 1518 and Bidar in 1528. [271] Although generally rivals, they allied against the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, permanently weakening Vijayanagar in the Battle of Talikota. [272] [273]
In the East, the Gajapati Kingdom remained a strong regional power to reckon with, associated with a high point in the growth of regional culture and architecture. Under Kapilendradeva , Gajapatis became an empire stretching from the lower Ganga in the north to the Kaveri in the south. [274] In Northeast India , the Ahom Kingdom was a major power for six centuries; [275] [276] led by Lachit Borphukan , the Ahoms decisively defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Saraighat during the Ahom-Mughal conflicts . [277] Further east in Northeastern India was the Kingdom of Manipur , which ruled from their seat of power at Kangla Fort and developed a sophisticated Hindu Gaudiya Vaishnavite culture. [278] [279] [280]
The Sultanate of Bengal was the dominant power of the Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta , with a network of mint towns spread across the region. It was a Sunni Muslim monarchy with Indo-Turkic, Arab, Abyssinian and Bengali Muslim elites. The sultanate was known for its religious pluralism where non-Muslim communities co-existed peacefully. The Bengal Sultanate had a circle of vassal states , including Odisha in the southwest, Arakan in the southeast, and Tripura in the east. In the early 16th century, the Bengal Sultanate reached the peak of its territorial growth with control over Kamrup and Kamata in the northeast and Jaunpur and Bihar in the west. It was reputed as a thriving trading nation and one of Asia's strongest states. The Bengal Sultanate was described by contemporary European and Chinese visitors as a relatively prosperous kingdom and the ""richest country to trade with"". The Bengal Sultanate left a strong architectural legacy. Buildings from the period show foreign influences merged into a distinct Bengali style. The Bengal Sultanate was also the largest and most prestigious authority among the independent medieval Muslim-ruled states in the history of Bengal . Its decline began with an interregnum by the Suri Empire , followed by Mughal conquest and disintegration into petty kingdoms.
Bhakti movement and Sikhism
See also: History of Sikhism
The Bhakti movement refers to the theistic devotional trend that emerged in medieval Hinduism [281] and later revolutionised in Sikhism . [282] It originated in the seventh-century south India (now parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala), and spread northwards. [281] It swept over east and north India from the 15th century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century. [283]
The Bhakti movement regionally developed around different gods and goddesses, such as Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva), Shaktism (Shakti goddesses), and Smartism . [284] [285] [286] The movement was inspired by many poet-saints, who championed a wide range of philosophical positions ranging from theistic dualism of Dvaita to absolute monism of Advaita Vedanta . [287] [288]
Sikhism is a monotheistic and panentheistic religion based on the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak , the first Guru, [289] and the ten successive Sikh gurus . After the death of the tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh , the Sikh scripture, Guru Granth Sahib , became the literal embodiment of the eternal, impersonal Guru, where the scripture's word serves as the spiritual guide for Sikhs. [290] [291] [292]
Buddhism in India flourished in the Himalayan kingdoms of Namgyal Kingdom in Ladakh , Sikkim Kingdom in Sikkim , and Chutia Kingdom in Arunachal Pradesh of the Late medieval period.

Early modern period (1526–1858)
The early modern period of Indian history is dated from 1526 to 1858, corresponding to the rise and fall of the Mughal Empire , which inherited from the Timurid Renaissance . During this age India's economy expanded, relative peace was maintained and arts were patronised. This period witnessed the further development of Indo-Islamic architecture ; [293] [294] the growth of Marathas and Sikhs enabled them to rule significant regions of India in the waning days of the Mughal empire. [14] With the discovery of the Cape route in the 1500s, the first Europeans to arrive by sea and establish themselves, were the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay . [295]

In 1526, Babur swept across the Khyber Pass and established the Mughal Empire, which at its zenith covered much of South Asia. [297] However, his son Humayun was defeated by the Afghan warrior Sher Shah Suri in 1540, and Humayun was forced to retreat to Kabul . After Sher Shah's death, his son Islam Shah Suri and his Hindu general Hemu Vikramaditya established secular rule in North India from Delhi until 1556, when Akbar ( r. 1556–1605), grandson of Babur, defeated Hemu in the Second Battle of Panipat on 6 November 1556 after winning Battle of Delhi . Akbar tried to establish a good relationship with the Hindus. Akbar declared ""Amari"" or non-killing of animals in the holy days of Jainism. He rolled back the jizya tax for non-Muslims. The Mughal emperors married local royalty, allied themselves with local maharajas , and attempted to fuse their Turko-Persian culture with ancient Indian styles, creating a unique Indo-Persian culture and Indo-Saracenic architecture .
Akbar married a Rajput princess, Mariam-uz-Zamani , and they had a son, Jahangir ( r. 1605–1627). [298] Jahangir followed his father's policy. The Mughal dynasty ruled most of the Indian subcontinent by 1600. The reign of Shah Jahan ( r. 1628–1658) was the golden age of Mughal architecture. He erected several large monuments, the most famous of which is the Taj Mahal at Agra.
It was one of the largest empires to have existed in the Indian subcontinent, [299] and surpassed China to become the world's largest economic power, controlling 24.4% of the world economy , [300] and the world leader in manufacturing, [301] producing 25% of global industrial output. [302] The economic and demographic upsurge was stimulated by Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production, [303] and a relatively high degree of urbanisation . [304]

The Mughal Empire reached the zenith of its territorial expanse during the reign of Aurangzeb ( r. 1658–1707), under whose reign India surpassed Qing China as the world's largest economy. [305] [306] Aurangzeb was less tolerant than his predecessors, reintroducing the jizya tax and destroying several historical temples, while at the same time building more Hindu temples than he destroyed, [307] employing significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors, and advancing administrators based on ability rather than religion. [308] However, he is often blamed for the erosion of the tolerant syncretic tradition of his predecessors, as well as increasing religious controversy and centralisation. The English East India Company suffered a defeat in the Anglo-Mughal War . [309] [310]
18th-century political formation in India
The Mughals suffered several blows due to invasions from Marathas , Rajputs , Jats and Afghans . In 1737, the Maratha general Bajirao of the Maratha Empire invaded and plundered Delhi. Under the general Amir Khan Umrao Al Udat, the Mughal Emperor sent 8,000 troops to drive away the 5,000 Maratha cavalry soldiers. Baji Rao easily routed the novice Mughal general. In 1737, in the final defeat of Mughal Empire, the commander-in-chief of the Mughal Army, Nizam-ul-mulk, was routed at Bhopal by the Maratha army. This essentially brought an end to the Mughal Empire.[ citation needed ] While Bharatpur State under Jat ruler Suraj Mal , overran the Mughal garrison at Agra and plundered the city. [311] In 1739, Nader Shah , emperor of Iran, defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Karnal . [312] After this victory, Nader captured and sacked Delhi, carrying away treasures including the Peacock Throne . [313] Ahmad Shah Durrani commenced his own invasions as ruler of the Durrani Empire , eventually sacking Delhi in 1757 . [314] Mughal rule was further weakened by constant native Indian resistance; Banda Singh Bahadur led the Sikh Khalsa against Mughal religious oppression; Hindu Rajas of Bengal, Pratapaditya and Raja Sitaram Ray revolted; and Maharaja Chhatrasal , of Bundela Rajputs, fought the Mughals and established the Panna State . [315] The Mughal dynasty was reduced to puppet rulers by 1757. Vadda Ghalughara took place under the Muslim provincial government based at Lahore to wipe out the Sikhs, with 30,000 Sikhs being killed, an offensive that had begun with the Mughals, with the Chhota Ghallughara , [316] and lasted several decades under its Muslim successor states. [317]

Maratha Empire

The Maratha kingdom was founded and consolidated by Chatrapati Shivaji . [318] However, the credit for making the Marathas formidable power nationally goes to Peshwa (chief minister) Bajirao I . Historian K.K. Datta wrote that Bajirao I ""may very well be regarded as the second founder of the Maratha Empire"". [319]
In the early 18th century, under the Peshwas, the Marathas consolidated and ruled over much of South Asia. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending Mughal rule in India. [320] [321] [322] In 1737, the Marathas defeated a Mughal army in their capital, in the Battle of Delhi. The Marathas continued their military campaigns against the Mughals, Nizam , Nawab of Bengal and the Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. At its peak, the domain of the Marathas encompassed most of the Indian subcontinent. [323] The Marathas even attempted to capture Delhi and discussed putting Vishwasrao Peshwa on the throne there in place of the Mughal emperor. [324]
The Maratha empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south, [325] to Peshawar (modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Pakistan [326] [note 2] ) in the north, and Bengal in the east. The Northwestern expansion of the Marathas was stopped after the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). However, the Maratha authority in the north was re-established within a decade under Peshwa Madhavrao I . [328]
Under Madhavrao I, the strongest knights were granted semi-autonomy, creating a confederacy of United Maratha states under the Gaekwads of Baroda , the Holkars of Indore and Malwa , the Scindias of Gwalior and Ujjain , the Bhonsales of Nagpur and the Puars of Dhar and Dewas . In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in Pune , which led to the First Anglo-Maratha War , resulting in a Maratha victory. [329] The Marathas remained a major power in India until their defeat in the Second and Third Anglo-Maratha Wars (1805–1818).
Sikh Empire
See also: Sikh architecture
The Sikh Empire was a political entity that governed the Northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent, based around the Punjab , from 1799 to 1849. It was forged, on the foundations of the Khalsa , under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839).[ citation needed ]
Maharaja Ranjit Singh consolidated much of northern India into an empire using his Sikh Khalsa Army , trained in European military techniques and equipped with modern military technologies. Ranjit Singh proved himself to be a master strategist and selected well-qualified generals for his army. He successfully ended the Afghan-Sikh Wars . In stages, he added central Punjab, the provinces of Multan and Kashmir, and the Peshawar Valley to his empire. [330] [331]
At its peak in the 19th century, the empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west, to Kashmir in the north, to Sindh in the south, running along Sutlej river to Himachal in the east. After the death of Ranjit Singh, the empire weakened, leading to conflict with the British East India Company. The First Anglo-Sikh War and Second Anglo-Sikh War marked the downfall of the Sikh Empire, making it among the last areas of the Indian subcontinent to be conquered by the British.
Other kingdoms
Territories of India in 1763
The Kingdom of Mysore in southern India expanded to its greatest extent under Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan in the later half of the 18th century. Under their rule, Mysore fought series of wars against the Marathas and British or their combined forces. The Maratha–Mysore War ended in April 1787, following the finalising of treaty of Gajendragad, in which Tipu Sultan was obligated to pay tribute to the Marathas. Concurrently, the Anglo-Mysore Wars took place, where the Mysoreans used the Mysorean rockets . The Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798–1799) saw the death of Tipu. Mysore's alliance with the French was seen as a threat to the British East India Company, and Mysore was attacked from all four sides. The Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas launched an invasion from the north. The British won a decisive victory at the Siege of Seringapatam (1799) .
Hyderabad was founded by the Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda in 1591. Following a brief Mughal rule, Asif Jah, a Mughal official, seized control of Hyderabad and declared himself Nizam-al-Mulk of Hyderabad in 1724. The Nizams lost considerable territory and paid tribute to the Maratha Empire after being routed in multiple battles, such as the Battle of Palkhed . [332] However, the Nizams maintained their sovereignty from 1724 until 1948 through paying tributes to the Marathas, and later, being vassals of the British. Hyderabad State became a princely state in British India in 1798.
The Nawabs of Bengal had become the de facto rulers of Bengal following the decline of Mughal Empire. However, their rule was interrupted by Marathas who carried out six expeditions in Bengal from 1741 to 1748, as a result of which Bengal became a tributary state of Marathas. On 23 June 1757, Siraj ud-Daulah , the last independent Nawab of Bengal was betrayed in the Battle of Plassey by Mir Jafar . He lost to the British, who took over the charge of Bengal in 1757, installed Mir Jafar on the Masnad (throne) and established itself to a political power in Bengal. [333] In 1765 the system of Dual Government was established, in which the Nawabs ruled on behalf of the British and were mere puppets to the British. In 1772 the system was abolished and Bengal was brought under the direct control of the British. In 1793, when the Nizamat (governorship) of the Nawab was also taken away, they remained as mere pensioners of the British East India Company . [334] [335]
In the 18th century, the whole of Rajputana was virtually subdued by the Marathas. The Second Anglo-Maratha War distracted the Marathas from 1807 to 1809, but afterward Maratha domination of Rajputana resumed. In 1817, the British went to war with the Pindaris , raiders who were fled in Maratha territory, which quickly became the Third Anglo-Maratha War , and the British government offered its protection to the Rajput rulers from the Pindaris and the Marathas. By the end of 1818 similar treaties had been executed between the other Rajput states and Britain. The Maratha Sindhia ruler of Gwalior gave up the district of Ajmer-Merwara to the British, and Maratha influence in Rajasthan came to an end. [336] Most of the Rajput princes remained loyal to Britain in the Revolt of 1857 , and few political changes were made in Rajputana until Indian independence in 1947. The Rajputana Agency contained more than 20 princely states, most notable being Udaipur State , Jaipur State , Bikaner State and Jodhpur State .
After the fall of the Maratha Empire, many Maratha dynasties and states became vassals in a subsidiary alliance with the British. With the decline of the Sikh Empire, after the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846, under the terms of the Treaty of Amritsar , the British government sold Kashmir to Maharaja Gulab Singh and the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, the second-largest princely state in British India, was created by the Dogra dynasty . [337] [338] While in eastern and north-eastern India, the Hindu and Buddhist states of Cooch Behar Kingdom , Twipra Kingdom and Kingdom of Sikkim were annexed by the British and made vassal princely state.
After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire , Polygar states emerged in Southern India; and managed to weather invasions and flourished until the Polygar Wars , where they were defeated by the British East India Company forces. [339] Around the 18th century, the Kingdom of Nepal was formed by Rajput rulers. [340]
European exploration
Main article: Colonial India
The route followed in Vasco da Gama 's first voyage (1497–1499)p
In 1498, a Portuguese fleet under Vasco da Gama discovered a new sea route from Europe to India, which paved the way for direct Indo-European commerce. The Portuguese soon set up trading posts in Velha Goa , Damaon , Dio island , and Bombay . The Portuguese instituted the Goa Inquisition , where new Indian converts were punished for suspected heresy against Christianity and non-Christians were condemned. [341] Goa remained the main Portuguese territory until it was annexed by India in 1961 . [342]
The next to arrive were the Dutch , with their main base in Ceylon . They established ports in Malabar . However, their expansion into India was halted after their defeat in the Battle of Colachel by the Kingdom of Travancore during the Travancore-Dutch War . The Dutch never recovered from the defeat and no longer posed a large colonial threat to India. [343] [344]
The internal conflicts among Indian kingdoms gave opportunities to the European traders to gradually establish political influence and appropriate lands. Following the Dutch, the British — who set up in the west coast port of Surat in 1619 — and the French both established trading outposts in India. Although continental European powers controlled various coastal regions of southern and eastern India during the ensuing century, they eventually lost all their territories in India to the British, with the exception of the French outposts of Pondichéry and Chandernagore , and the Portuguese colonies of Goa, Daman and Diu . [345] [346]

The English East India Company was founded in 1600. It gained a foothold in India with the establishment of a factory in Masulipatnam on the Eastern coast of India in 1611 and a grant of rights by the Mughal emperor Jahangir to establish a factory in Surat in 1612. In 1640, after receiving similar permission from the Vijayanagara ruler farther south, a second factory was established in Madras on the southeastern coast. The islet of Bom Bahia in present-day Mumbai (Bombay), was a Portuguese outpost not far from Surat, it was presented to Charles II of England as dowry , in his marriage to Catherine of Braganza ; Charles in turn leased Bombay to the Company in 1668. Two decades later, the company established a trade post in the River Ganges delta. During this time other companies established by the Portuguese , Dutch , French , and Danish were similarly expanding in the subcontinent.
The company's victory under Robert Clive in the 1757 Battle of Plassey and another victory in the 1764 Battle of Buxar (in Bihar), consolidated the company's power, and forced emperor Shah Alam II to appoint it the diwan , or revenue collector, of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa . The company thus became the de facto ruler of large areas of the lower Gangetic plain by 1773. It also proceeded by degrees to expand its dominions around Bombay and Madras. The Anglo-Mysore Wars (1766–99) and the Anglo-Maratha Wars (1772–1818) left it in control of large areas of India south of the Sutlej River . With the defeat of the Marathas , no native power represented a threat for the company any longer. [347]
The expansion of the company's power chiefly took two forms. The first of these was the outright annexation of Indian states and subsequent direct governance of the underlying regions that collectively came to comprise British India. The annexed regions included the North-Western Provinces (comprising Rohilkhand , Gorakhpur , and the Doab ) (1801), Delhi (1803), Assam ( Ahom Kingdom 1828) and Sindh (1843). Punjab , North-West Frontier Province , and Kashmir were annexed after the Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1849–56 (Period of tenure of Marquess of Dalhousie Governor General). However, Kashmir was immediately sold under the Treaty of Amritsar (1850) to the Dogra Dynasty of Jammu and thereby became a princely state. In 1854, Berar was annexed along with the state of Oudh two years later.[ citation needed ]

The second form of asserting power involved treaties in which Indian rulers acknowledged the company's hegemony in return for limited internal autonomy . Since the company operated under financial constraints, it had to set up political underpinnings for its rule. [348] The most important such support came from the subsidiary alliances with Indian princes. [348] In the early 19th century, the territories of these princes accounted for two-thirds of India. [348] When an Indian ruler who was able to secure his territory wanted to enter such an alliance, the company welcomed it as an economical method of indirect rule that did not involve the economic costs of direct administration or the political costs of gaining the support of alien subjects. [349]
In return, the company undertook the ""defense of these subordinate allies and treated them with traditional respect and marks of honor."" [349] Subsidiary alliances created the Princely States of the Hindu maharajas and the Muslim nawabs . Prominent among the princely states were Cochin (1791), Jaipur (1794), Travancore (1795), Hyderabad (1798), Mysore (1799), Cis-Sutlej Hill States (1815), Central India Agency (1819), Cutch and Gujarat Gaikwad territories (1819), Rajputana (1818), [350] and Bahawalpur (1833).
Indian indenture system
Main article: Indian indenture system
The Indian indenture system was an ongoing system of indenture, a form of debt bondage, by which 3.5 million Indians were transported to colonies of European powers to provide labour for the (mainly sugar) plantations. It started from the end of slavery in 1833 and continued until 1920. This resulted in the development of a large Indian diaspora that spread from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean and the growth of large Indo-Caribbean and Indo-African populations.
Late modern period and contemporary history (1857–1947)
Rebellion of 1857 and its consequences

Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi , one of the principal leaders of the rebellion who earlier had lost her kingdom as a result of the Doctrine of lapse .
Bahadur Shah Zafar , the last Mughal Emperor. Crowned Emperor of India by the rebels, he was deposed by the British and died in exile in Burma.
Charles Canning , the Governor-General of India during the rebellion.
Lord Dalhousie , the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the Doctrine of Lapse .
The Indian rebellion of 1857 was a large-scale rebellion by soldiers employed by the British East India Company in northern and central India against the company's rule. The spark that led to the mutiny was the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the Enfield rifle, which was insensitive to local religious prohibition. The key mutineer was Mangal Pandey . [351] In addition, the underlying grievances over British taxation, the ethnic gulf between the British officers and their Indian troops and land annexations played a significant role in the rebellion. Within weeks after Pandey's mutiny, dozens of units of the Indian army joined peasant armies in widespread rebellion. The rebel soldiers were later joined by Indian nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the Doctrine of Lapse and felt that the company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as Nana Sahib and the Rani of Jhansi belonged to this group. [352]
After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut , the rebels very quickly reached Delhi. The rebels had also captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). Most notably, in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British presence. [353] However, the British East India Company mobilised rapidly with the assistance of friendly Princely states , but it took the British the better part of 1858 to suppress the rebellion. Due to the rebels being poorly equipped and having no outside support or funding, they were brutally subdued. [354]
In the aftermath, all power was transferred from the British East India Company to the British Crown , which began to administer most of India as provinces. The Crown controlled the company's lands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of the Princely states ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, but only 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad, and Kashmir). They were absorbed into the independent nation in 1947–48. [355]

After 1857, the colonial government strengthened and expanded its infrastructure via the court system, legal procedures, and statutes. The Indian Penal Code came into being. [356] In education, Thomas Babington Macaulay had made schooling a priority for the Raj in 1835 and succeeded in implementing the use of English for instruction. By 1890 some 60,000 Indians had matriculated. [357] The Indian economy grew at about 1% per year from 1880 to 1920, and the population also grew at 1%. However, from 1910s Indian private industry began to grow significantly. India built a modern railway system in the late 19th century which was the fourth largest in the world. [358] Historians have been divided on issues of economic history, with the Nationalist school arguing that India was poorer due to British rule. [359]
In 1905, Lord Curzon split the large province of Bengal into a largely Hindu western half and ""Eastern Bengal and Assam"", a largely Muslim eastern half. The British goal was said to be efficient administration but the people of Bengal were outraged at the apparent ""divide and rule"" strategy. It also marked the beginning of the organised anti-colonial movement. When the Liberal party in Britain came to power in 1906, he was removed. Bengal was reunified in 1911. The new Viceroy Gilbert Minto and the new Secretary of State for India John Morley consulted with Congress leaders on political reforms. The Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 provided for Indian membership of the provincial executive councils as well as the Viceroy's executive council. The Imperial Legislative Council was enlarged from 25 to 60 members and separate communal representation for Muslims was established in a dramatic step towards representative and responsible government. [360] Several socio-religious organisations came into being at that time. Muslims set up the All India Muslim League in 1906 to protect the interests of the aristocratic Muslims. The Hindu Mahasabha and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) sought to represent Hindu interests though the latter always claimed it to be a ""cultural"" organisation. [361] Sikhs founded the Shiromani Akali Dal in 1920. [362] However, the largest and oldest political party Indian National Congress , founded in 1885, attempted to keep a distance from the socio-religious movements and identity politics. [363]

Indian Renaissance

Pandita Ramabai (1858–1922) was a social reformer , and a pioneer in the education and emancipation of women in India
Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) was a Bengali language poet, short-story writer, and playwright, and in addition a music composer and painter, who won the Nobel prize for Literature in 1913
Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887–1920) was an Indian mathematician who made seminal contributions to number theory
The Bengali Renaissance refers to a social reform movement, dominated by Bengali Hindus , in the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a period of British rule. Historian Nitish Sengupta describes the renaissance as having started with reformer and humanitarian Raja Ram Mohan Roy (1775–1833), and ended with Asia's first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941). [364] This flowering of religious and social reformers, scholars, and writers is described by historian David Kopf as ""one of the most creative periods in Indian history."" [365]
During this period, Bengal witnessed an intellectual awakening that is in some way similar to the Renaissance . This movement questioned existing orthodoxies, particularly with respect to women, marriage, the dowry system, the caste system , and religion. One of the earliest social movements that emerged during this time was the Young Bengal movement, which espoused rationalism and atheism as the common denominators of civil conduct among upper caste educated Hindus. [366] It played an important role in reawakening Indian minds and intellect across the Indian subcontinent.

During British East India Company and British Crown rule, India experienced some of deadliest ever recorded famines . These famines, usually resulting from crop failures and often exacerbated by policies of the colonial government, [367] included the Great Famine of 1876–1878 in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died, [368] the Great Bengal famine of 1770 where between 1 and 10 million people died, [369] [370] the Indian famine of 1899–1900 in which 1.25 to 10 million people died, [367] and the Bengal famine of 1943 where between 2.1 and 3.8 million people died. [371] The Third plague pandemic in the mid-19th century killed 10 million people in India. [372] Despite persistent diseases and famines, the population of the Indian subcontinent, which stood at up to 200 million in 1750, [373] had reached 389 million by 1941. [374]

The largest of all indian's railway bridges is the Chenab Bridge , located on the Jammu–Baramulla line that connects the Jammu region and the Kashmir Valley , which turned out to be the most expensive line of Indian's railway network. The Chenab Bridge was the highest arch bridge in the world when opening in 2022 with a deck 322 m (1,056 ft) above the Chenab River , it's still the highest railway bridge on earth nowadays. [41] [42]
Extradosed bridges have experienced remarkable growth in India since the 2010s with a large number of multi-span bridges built on rivers such as the Ganges , which has significant widths in certain places. Their advantages are as follows:
They allow longer spans than conventional beam bridges and therefore a reduced number of foundations .
The thickness of the deck is considerably reduced (the Arrah–Chhapra bridge deck is 3.4 m (11 ft) thick), thereby minimizing the amount of concrete.
They can be made up of precast segments even for medium spans and then be erected much more quickly and easily than the typical in-situ concrete construction.
A more elegant aesthetic appearance than conventional beam bridges. [43]
The first major extradosed bridge built in India is the Second Vivekananda Bridge between Howrah and Kolkata . It has 8 pylons and a suspended length of 880 m (2,890 ft), which was among the longest in its category at the time. Additionally it had one of the largest numbers of spans at the time. Another main feature of the bridge is its 29 m (95 ft) width with 6 road lanes for a single plane axial suspension. [44]
The Arrah–Chhapra Bridge held the record for the longest total extradosed span length in the world when it was inaugurated in 2017, with 16 pylons and 1,920 m (6,300 ft), surpassing the well-known Twinkle Ibigawa Bridge [ ja ] in Japan . [43] This record will be largely beaten by the new Kacchi Dargah–Bidupur Bridge under construction with 66 pylons and an extradose length of 9,750 m (31,990 ft). [45]
The Rajendra Setu was the first rail-cum-road bridge in independent India on the river Ganga , one of the major rivers in the country.
This table presents the structures with spans greater than 120 metres (390 ft) (non-exhaustive list).

Kakatiya dynasty - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakatiya_Dynasty,"12th–14th century Indian dynasty
Kakatiya dynasty
Map of the Kakatiyas, circa 1150–1300 CE. [2]
Status
e
The Kakatiya dynasty ( IAST : Kākatīya) [a] was a Telugu dynasty that ruled most of eastern Deccan region in present-day India between 12th and 14th centuries. [6] Their territory comprised much of the present day Telangana and Andhra Pradesh , and parts of eastern Karnataka , northern Tamil Nadu , and southern Odisha . [7] [8] Their capital was Orugallu, now known as Warangal .
Early Kakatiya rulers served as feudatories to Rashtrakutas and Western Chalukyas for more than two centuries. They assumed sovereignty under Prataparudra I in 1163 CE by suppressing other Chalukya subordinates in the Telangana region. [9] Ganapati Deva (r. 1199–1262) significantly expanded Kakatiya lands during the 1230s and brought under Kakatiya control the Telugu-speaking lowland delta areas around the Godavari and Krishna rivers. Ganapati Deva was succeeded by Rudrama Devi (r. 1262–1289) who is one of the few queens in Indian history. Marco Polo , who visited India around 1289–1293, made note of Rudrama Devi's rule and nature in flattering terms. She successfully repelled the attacks of Yadavas (Seuna) of Devagiri into the Kakatiyan territory. [9]
In 1303, Alauddin Khalji , the emperor of the Delhi Sultanate invaded the Kakatiya territory which ended up as a disaster for the Turks. [b] But after the successful siege of Warangal in 1310, Prataparudra II was forced to pay annual tribute to Delhi. Another attack by Ulugh Khan (i.e. Tughluq) in 1323 saw stiff resistance by the Kakatiyan army, but they were finally defeated. The demise of the Kakatiya dynasty resulted in confusion and anarchy under alien rulers for some time, before Musunuri Nayakas united the various Telugu clans and recovered Warangal from the Delhi Sultanate . [10]
Kakatiyas unified the distinct upland and lowland cultures of Telugu lands, which brought into being a feeling of cultural affinity between those who spoke the Telugu language . Kakatiya period also saw the construction of reservoirs for irrigation in the uplands called ""tanks"" many of which are still used today. They were egalitarian in nature and anyone, regardless of birth, could acquire the nayaka title that denoted the warrior status. They recruited peasants into the military which resulted in a new warrior class and provided social mobility. Kakatiya era also saw the development of a distinct style of architecture that improved and innovated upon the existing modes. [11] Most notable examples are the Thousand Pillar Temple in Hanamkonda , Ramappa Temple in Palampet, Warangal Fort , Golconda Fort and Kota Gullu in Ghanpur .
Etymology and names
Studies of the inscriptions and coinage by the historian Dineshchandra Sircar reveal that there was no contemporary standard spelling of the family name. Variants include Kakatiya, Kakatiyya, Kakita, Kakati and Kakatya. The family name was often prefixed to the name of the monarch, giving constructs such as Kakatiya-Prataparudra. Some of the monarchs also had alternate names; for example, Venkata and Venkataraya may have been alternate names of Prataparuda I, with the former appearing on a coin in the form Venkata-Kakatiya. [12] [c]
According to Kakatiya inscriptions, the family's name derives from the name of a place called Kakati. However, Kumarasvami Somapithin, in his 15th-century commentary on Vidynatha's Prataparudra-Yashobhushanam or Prataparudriya states that the family was named after their tutelary goddess Kakati, a form of Durga . [13] [14] It is possible that the early Kakatiya chiefs resided at a place called Kakati, which had a shrine of their tutelary goddess. [15] [16]
Although the Hindu mythological texts do not mention any such form of Durga, the worship of a goddess named Kakati is attested by several other sources. For example, Vallabharaya's Krida-bhiramamu mentions an image of Kakatamma (""Mother Kakati"") in the Kakatiya capital Orugallu. The 16th century Shitap Khan inscription mentions the reinstallation of the image of goddess Jaganmatruka (mother of the universe) and the lotus seat of the Kakatirajya, which had been destroyed by the Turushkas (Turkic people). [17] According to one theory, Kakati was originally a Jain goddess (possibly Padmavati ) and later came to be regarded as a form of Durga. [14]
The Bayyaram tank inscription from the reign of Ganapati-deva states that the Kakatiya chief Venna (c. 9th century) resided at Kakati, because of which his descendants came to be known as Kakatishas (""lords of Kakati""). [18] Ganapati-deva's Garavapadu charter traces the family's ancestry to Durjaya , a legendary chieftain of ancient Andhra, arrived at a town called Kakati during a hunting expedition, and set up his camp there. [16] The modern identity of Kakati is uncertain: different historians have variously attempted to identify it with modern Kakati village in Karnataka and Kanker in Chhattisgarh . Siddheshvara-Charitra, a later literary work, states that the ancestors of the Kakatiya family lived at Kandarapura (identified with modern Kandhar in Maharashtra ). However, no other evidence supports this tradition. [19] Later, the Kakatiya capital Orugallu (present-day Warangal) was also called ""Kakati-pura"" (""Kakati town""), as attested by some inscriptions of the dynasty. [15]
Sources
Vishnu with his mount, Garuda, his consort, Lakshmi, and attendants, 12-13th century, Kakatiya period. Kalyani region, Andhra Pradesh , India
Much of the information about the Kakatiya period comes from inscriptions, including around 1,000 stone inscriptions, and 12 copper-plate inscriptions. [20] Most of these inscriptions document matters relating to religion, such as donations to Hindu temples. They are particularly abundant for the period 1175–1324 CE, which is the period when the dynasty most flourished and are a reflection of that. The probability is that many inscriptions have been lost due to buildings falling into disuse and also the ravages of subsequent rulers, most notably the Muslim Mughal Empire in the Telangana region. Inscriptions are still being discovered today but governmental agencies tend to concentrate on recording those that are already known rather than searching for new examples. [21] A 1978 book written by P.V.P. Sastry on the history of the Kakatiyas, published by the Government of Andhra Pradesh also constitutes one of the sources. Tamil stone inscription from Kakatiya king Prataparudra was found in Motupalli , Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh. [22]
Information about the Kakatiya period also comes from Sanskrit and Telugu literary works written during Kakatiya and post-Kakatiya period. The most notable among these works include Prataparudriyam, Krida-bhiramamu, Panditaradhya-charitamu, Sivayogasaramu, Nitisara, Niti-sastra-muktavali, Nrutya-ratnavali, Pratapa-charita, Siddhesvara-charitra, Somadeva-rajiyamu, Palnativira-charitra, Velugotivari-vamsavali, and Velugotivari-vamsacharitra. [23] Chronicles by Muslim authors such as Isami and Firishta describe Prataparudra's defeats against the Muslim armies. The Kannada text Kumara-Ramana-charita also provides information about Prataparudra's relations with the Kampili kingdom . [24]
Besides epigraphs and literature, the forts, temples and tanks constructed during the Kakatiya period are an important source of information about contemporary society, art and architecture. [25]

The Kakatiya rulers traced their ancestry to a legendary chief or ruler named Durjaya . [16] Many other ruling dynasties of Andhra also claimed descent from Durjaya. Nothing further is known about this chief. [26]
Most of the Kakatiya records do not mention the Varna (social class) of the family, but the majority of the ones that do, proudly describe them as Shudra . [27] Examples include the Bothpur and Vaddamanu inscriptions of Ganapati's general Malyala Gunda senani. The Kakatiyas also maintained marital relations with other Shudra families, such as the Kotas and the Natavadi chiefs. All this evidence indicates that the Kakatiyas were of Shudra origin. [28]
A few copper-plate inscriptions of the Kakatiya family describe them as belonging to the Kshatriya (warrior) varna. These inscriptions primarily document grants to Brahmans , and appear to be inspired by the genealogies of the Imperial Cholas . [27] For example, the Motupalli inscription of Ganapati counts legendary solar dynasty kings such as Rama among the ancestors of Durjaya, the progenitor of the Kakatiya family. The Malkapuram inscription of Visvesvara Sivacharya, the preceptor of Kakatiya rulers Ganapati-deva and Rudrama-devi, also connects the Kakatiyas to the solar dynasty (Sūryavaṃsa). [29] The term ""Kshatriya"" in these panegyric records appears to signify the family's warrior-like qualities rather than their actual varna. [30]
Relationship to the Rashtrakutas
Kubera, Hoysala-Kakatiya period, 1100-1350 CE.
According to an interpretation of the Mangallu and the Bayyaram inscriptions, the Kakatiyas were not just Rashtrakuta vassals, but also a branch of the Rashtrakuta family. [31]
The 956 CE Mangallu inscription was issued by the Vengi Chalukya prince Dānārnava, at the request of the Kakatiya chief Gunda IV . [32] The inscription names Gundyana's ancestors as Gundiya-Rashtrakuta ( Gunda III ) and Eriya-Rashtrakuta ( Erra ). [33] This suggests that Gunda IV was a Rashtrakuta general, and not a Vengi Chalukya subordinate, as assumed by some earlier historians. [33]
The Bayyaram tank inscription, which records the construction of the Dharma-kirti-samudra tank by Ganapati's sister Mailama (or Mailamba), provides another genealogical list. [34] The similarities of names mentioned in the Mangallu and Bayyaram inscriptions lists suggest that both of these refer to the same family: [35]

The significance of the suffix ""Rashtrakuta"" in the names of the early Kakatiya chiefs is debated. According to one theory, the suffix only implies that these chiefs were Rashtrakuta's subordinates. This theory is based on the fact that the phrase Rashtrakuta-kutumbinah appears in several Rashtrakuta-era copper-plate inscriptions, and refers to the officers and subjects of the Rashtrakuta kingdom. [37]
According to another theory, the suffix implies that the Kakatiyas were a branch of the Rashtrakuta family because the term Rashtrakuta-kutumbinah was used for officers employed by the Rashtrakuta administration, not feudatory chiefs: the early records of the Kakatiya chiefs describe them as samantas (feudatory chiefs). [38] The Kazipet Darga inscription of Durgaraja states that his father Beta II was born in the family of Samanta Viṣṭi. [39] Historian P.V.P. Sastry theorises that ""Viṣṭi"" is a corruption of Vrishni , the name of a clan from which some Rashtrakutas claimed descent. He notes that some chiefs of Rashtrakuta origin adopted the title ""Viṭṭi-narayana"", which means ""as great as Narayana ( Krishna ) of the Vitti (Vrishni) family. [40] Sastry further proposes that the term ""Voddi"", which appears in the phrase Voddi-kula (""Voddi family"") in the Mangallu inscription may be same as ""Viṣṭi"". [41] Sastry also believes that the early Kakatiya chiefs followed Jainism , which was also patronized by the Rashtrakutas, thus strengthening the view that the two dynasties were connected (see Religion section below). [14]
The Kakatiyas seemed to have adopted the mythical bird Garuda as their royal insignia, as attested by the Ekamranatha temple inscription of Ganapati-deva, the Palampet inscription of the Kakatiya general Recharla Rudra , and Vidyanatha's Prataparudriya. [39] The Bayyaram tank inscription calls the Kakatiya chief Beta I (son of Gunda IV) Garudamka-Beta, and ""Garuda"" here appears to refer to the family's emblem. [42] In Hindu mythology, Garuda is the vahana of god Vishnu . The Rashtrakutas and some other dynasties of Deccan claimed descent from the Vrishni clan (associated with Vishnu's avatar Krishna ) and had adopted Garuda as their royal insignia. [38] According to Sastry, this corroborates the theory that the Kakatiyas were associated with the Rashtrakuta family. [5] Sastry further speculates that the Kakatiyas may have adopted the Garuda symbol because of Jain influence: the yaksha of the Jain tirthankara Shantinatha is represented by the Garuda symbol. [5] However, when the Kakatiyas switched their allegiance to the Chalukyas of Kalyani , they also adopted the varaha symbol used by the Chalukyas. [43]
Based on Ganapati-deva's Garavapadu inscription, which names Karikala Chola among the family's ancestors, epigraphist C.R.K. Charlu theorised that the Kakatiyas were a branch of the Telugu Chodas . However, no other Kakatiya record mentions Karikala, and unlike the Telugu Chodas, the Kakatiyas did not claim to belong to the Kashyapa - gotra . Therefore, Sastry dismisses Charlu's theory as untenable. [41]
Early feudatory chiefs
The regnal years of the early members of the Kakatiya family are not certain. The earliest known Kakatiya chief is Venna or Vanna (r. c. 800-815), who claimed descent from Durjaya ,  legendary chieftain of ancient Andhra. According to Kakatiya inscriptions, he ruled from a town called Kakati, because of which his family was called Kakatishas (""lords of Kakati""). Not much is known about his successors Gunda I and Gunda II, who ruled during c. 815-865 CE. [44] The Bayyaram tank inscription compares his successors - Gunda I, Gunda II, and Gunda III - to the three Ramas ( Parashurama , Dasharatha-Rama , and Balarama ).
The c. 956 CE Mangallu inscription suggests that the Kakatiyas came to the Telugu -speaking region as commanders of the Rashtrakuta armies. [15] The earliest of these was Venna's son Gunda III , who died during Krishna II 's invasion of the Vengi Chalukya kingdom around 895 CE. [45] Krishna II captured the Kurravadi (possibly present-day Kuravi ) region from the Vengi Chalukyas, and probably appointed Gunda III's son Erra as a governor there. Not much is known about Erra's son Betiya. [46]
As a Rashtrakuta vassal, Betiya's son Gunda IV (r. c. 955-995) helped the Vengi Chalukya prince Danarnava ascend the throne after a succession dispute. In 973 CE, after the collapse of the Rashtrakuta empire and the murder of Danarnava, he attempted to carve out an independent principality at Kuravi . The Mudugonda Chalukyas, whom he had displaced from Kuravi, sought help from the Kalyani Chalukyas , who had usurped the power from the Rashtrakutas. The Kalyani Chalukya forces probably defeated and killed Gunda IV. [47] His son Beta I (r. c. 1000-1052 CE) accepted the Kalyani Chalukya suzerainty and received from them the fief of Anumakonda (modern Hanamakonda), which later became the Kakatiya capital. He distinguished himself in the Chalukya campaigns against the Cholas, during the reign of Someshvara I . [48]
Prola I (r. c. 1052-1076), the son of Beta I, participated in various Chalukya military campaigns, consolidated the Kakatiya control around Anumakonda by defeating local chiefs, and obtained Anumakonda as a hereditary fief. [49] [50] The Chalukya king granted his son Beta II (r. c. 996-1051) the Sabbi-1000 province (the historical Sabbi-nadu region with 1000 villages, centred around Vemulavada ). [51] He was succeeded by his sons, first Durga-raja  and then Prola II (r. c. 1116–1157). [52]
After the decline of the Rashtrakuta power, the Kakatiyas served as vassals of the Kalyani Chalukyas . After the decline of the Chalukya power in the 12th century, they assumed sovereignty by suppressing other Chalukya subordinates in the Telangana region. [53]

The 1149 Sanigaram inscription of Prola II is the last known record of the Kakatiyas as vassals. The 1163 Anumakonda inscription of Rudradeva alias Prataparudra I is the earliest known record that describes the Kakatiyas as a sovereign power. [56]
According to Sastry, Prataparudra I reigned between around 1158 – 1195, [52] while Sircar gives the dates 1163–1195. He was also known as Rudra Deva, Kakatiya Rudradeva, Venkata, and Venkataraya [12] [57] He was the son of Prola II, who had made efforts to assert greater Kakatiya influence on territories in the eastern parts of the declining Western Chalukyan empire and who died in a battle fought against the Velanati Choda ruler Gonka II around 1157/1158 while doing so. [58] [59] It was during Prataparudra's reign, in 1163, that the Kakatiyas declared an end to their status as feudatory chiefs of the Chalukyas. [d] It is notable that inscriptions were henceforth written using the Kakatiya chiefs' vernacular Telugu rather than the Kannada language that had prevailed until that point. [60]
Mahadeva succeeded Prataparudra I as king, reigning probably from 1195 to 1199. [52]
Ganapati
Just as the Yadava and Hoysala dynasties took control of linguistically related areas during the 13th century, so too did the Kakatiyas under the rule of Ganapati. [60] He is also known as Ganapathi Deva and, according to Sastry, reigned between 1199 and 1262; Sircar gives regnal dates of 1199–1260. [52] [57] He significantly expanded Kakatiya lands during the 1230s when he launched a series of attacks outside the dynasty's traditional Telangana region and thus brought under Kakatiya control the Telugu-speaking lowland delta areas around the Godavari and Krishna rivers. The outcome in the case of all three dynasties, says historian Richard Eaton, was that they ""catalysed processes of supralocal identity formation and community building"". [60]
The Kakatiya capital at Orugallu, established in 1195, was not forgotten while Ganapati expanded his territory. He organised the building of a massive granite wall around the city, complete with ramps designed for ease of access to its ramparts from within. A moat and numerous bastions were also constructed. [61]
Ganapati was keen to bolster the dynasty's economy. He encouraged merchants to trade abroad, abolishing all taxes except for a fixed duty and supporting those who risked their lives to travel afar. [62] He created the man-made Pakhal Lake .
Rudrama Devi
Statue of Rudrama Devi .
Rudrama Devi , also known as Rudramadevi, reigned around 1262–1289 CE (alternative dates: 1261–1295 CE) and is one of the few queens in Indian history. [52] [63] [64] Sources disagree regarding whether she was the widow of Ganapati or his daughter. [65]
Marco Polo , who visited India probably sometime around 1289–1293, made note of Rudrama Devi's rule and nature in flattering terms. [66] [e] She continued the planned fortification of the capital, raising the height of Ganapati's wall as well as adding a second earthen curtain wall 1.5 miles (2.4 km) in diameter and with an additional 150 feet (46 m)-wide moat. [61]
A fragmentary Kannada language inscription also states that the Kakatiya general Bhairava defeated the Yadava army probably in or after 1263 CE, which may be a reference to his repulsion of Mahadeva 's invasion. A coin of Mahadeva bears the Kakatiya emblem varaha with the Yadava symbols; this varaha may have been stuck on Mahadeva's coins to mark the Kakatiya victory. [9]
Rudrama was married to Virabhadra, an Eastern Chalukyan prince of Nidadavolu who had been selected for that purpose by her father. [67] Having no son as an heir, [61] Rudrama abdicated in favour of her grandson when it became apparent that the expansionist sultan Alauddin Khalji was encroaching on the Deccan and might in due course attack the Kakatiyas. [65]
Prataparudra II
The earliest biography of Rudrama Devi's successor, Prataparudra II , is the Prataparudra Caritramu, dating from the 16th century. [68] His reign began in 1289 (alternative date: 1295) and ended with the demise of the dynasty in 1323. [52] [64] It is described by Eaton as the ""first chapter in a larger story"" that saw the style of polity in the Deccan change from being regional kingdoms to transregional sultanates that survived until the arrival of the British East India Company in the 18th century. [69]
Decline
A replica of the Koh-i-Noor diamond. The diamond was originally owned by the Kakatiya dynasty.
The Kakatiya kingdom attracted the attention of the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji because of the possibility of plunder. [70] The first foray into the Kakatiya kingdom was made in 1303 by Malik Chajju, the nephew of the Indian Muslim Wazir Nusrat Khan Jalesari of Delhi, and Fakhruddin Jauna , [71] [72] which was a disaster due to the resistance of the Kakatiya army in the Battle of Upparapalli . [73] [f] In 1309 the Gujarati general, Malik Kafur , [74] in an attempt to force Prataparudra into acceptance of a position subordinate to the sultanate at Delhi. Kafur organised a month-long siege of Orugallu that ended with success in February 1310. Prataparudra was forced to make various symbolic acts of obeisance designed to demonstrate his new position as a subordinate but, as was Alauddin's plan, he was not removed as ruler of the area but rather forced thereafter to pay annual tribute to Delhi. [75] It was probably at this time that the Koh-i-Noor diamond passed from Kakatiya ownership to that of Alauddin, along with 20,000 horses and 100 elephants. [70]
In 1311, Prataparudra formed a part of the sultanate forces that attacked the Pandyan empire in the south, and he took advantage of that situation to quell some of his vassals in Nellore who had seen his reduced status as an opportunity for independence. Later, though, in 1318, he failed to provide the annual tribute to Delhi, claiming that the potential for being attacked on the journey made it impossible. The succeeding Sultan Mubarak Shah responded by sending another of his Gujarati generals, Khusrau Khan , [76] to Orugallu with a force that bristled with technology previously unknown in the area, including trebuchet -like machines. Prataparudra had to submit once more , with his obeisance on this occasion being arranged by the sultanate to include a very public display whereby he bowed towards Delhi from the ramparts of Orugallu. The amount of his annual tribute was changed, becoming 100 elephants and 12,000 horses. [77]
The new arrangements did not last long. Taking advantage of a revolution in Delhi that saw the Khalji dynasty removed and the Punjab-born Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq installed as sultan, [78] Prataparudra again asserted his independence in 1320. Tughlaq sent his son, Jauna Khan , to defeat the defiant Kakatiya king in 1321. Khan's army was riven with internal dissension due to rumours of the king's death, which caused many officers to leave the army. [79] This caused the siege on this occasion to last much longer — six months, rather than the few weeks that had previously been the case. The attackers were initially repulsed and Khan's forces retreated to regroup in Devagiri. Prataparudra celebrated the apparent victory by opening up his grain stores for public feasting. Khan returned in 1323 with his revitalised and reinforced army and, with few supplies left, Prataparudra was forced into submission after a five-month siege. The unprepared and battle-weary army of Orugallu was finally defeated, and Orugallu was renamed Sultanpur. It seems probable, from combining various contemporary and near-contemporary accounts, that Prataparudra committed suicide near the Narmada River while being taken as a prisoner to Delhi. [80] [81]
Characterization
Geography
The Kakatiya base was the city of Orugallu [82] in the dry uplands of northern Telangana on the Deccan Plateau . From there they expanded their influence into Coastal Andhra , the delta between the Godavari and Krishna rivers that feed into the Bay of Bengal . According to Rao and Shulman, the latter contained a high proportion of Brahmins while the former was the haunt of ""peasants, artisans and warriors"". [83] Under the Kakatiyas, cultural innovation often began in the uplands, was refined in the lowlands and then recycled back into the Deccan. This bi-directional flow of cultural influences brought into being a feeling of cultural affinity between those who spoke the Telugu language where nothing of that nature had previously existed. [g] The unification of the distinct upland and lowland cultures was their most significant political achievement, achieved through a process of binding many locally powerful figures in allegiance to the empire. [82]
The area of land under Kakatiya control reached its zenith around the 13th century CE during the rule of Ganapati Deva. By this time, South India and the Deccan were essentially under the aegis of four Hindu monarchies , of which the Kakatiyas were one. [h] The four dynasties were in a constant state of warfare with each other, with the Kakatiyas eventually exercising control from close to Anagondi in the west to Kalyani in the north-east, and down to Kanei and Ganjam district in southern Orissa . [7]
Architecture
13th century Ramappa Temple in Telangana .
A notable trend during the dynastic period was the construction of reservoirs for irrigation in the uplands, around 5000 of which were built by warrior families subordinate to the Kakatiyas. This dramatically altered the possibilities for development in the sparsely populated dry areas. Many of these edifices, often called ""tanks"", including the large examples at Pakala and Ramappa, are still used today. [84]
Another notable architectural feature of the dynasty relates to temples. Even before the arrival of the dynasty, there were large, well-established and well-endowed Hindu places of worship in the relatively populous delta areas; however, the temples of the uplands, which were smaller and less cosmopolitan in origin and funding, did not exist until the Kakatiya period. In the lowlands, where Brahmins were numerous, the temples had long benefited from a desire to build social networks for the purposes of domestic and foreign trade, as well as for obtaining grazing rights in the face of competition; in the uplands, the endowment of the buildings was often associated with the construction and continued maintenance of reservoirs and enabled a different type of networking based on political hierarchies. The strengthening of those hierarchies, which was achieved in part by donating land for the temples and then attending worship, was necessary as the inland agrarian society grew rapidly in number and location. [85]
Society
There is a disparity between the analysis of inscriptions, of which the work of Cynthia Talbot has been in the vanguard and the traditional works of Vedic Hinduism that described pre-colonial India in terms of a reverent and static society that was subject to the strictures of the caste system . Colonial British administrators found much that appealed to them in the latter works but the Kakatiya inscriptions of Andhra Pradesh, which depict a far wider range of society and events, suggest that the reality was far more fluid and very different from the idealised image. [86]
Caste itself seems to have been of low importance as a social identifier. [87] There was a lack of consistency regarding the varna rank of Kakatiyas. In most of their inscriptions, no varna affiliation was specified. In the case of a few where it was specified, they were mostly recorded to have been Kshatriyas. A handful of the inscriptions however tried to portray them as Kshatriyas. [i] Anyone, regardless of birth, could acquire the nayaka title to denote warrior statusKshatriy and this they did. There is also little evidence that Kakatiya society paid much regard to caste identities, in the sense of jāti . Although occupation does appear to have been an important designator of social position, the inscriptions suggest that people were not bound to an occupation by birth. [88] [89]
The population became more settled in geographic terms. The growth of an agricultural peasant class subsumed many tribal people who previously had been nomadic.  The nexus of politics and military was a significant feature of the era, and the Kakatiya recruitment of peasants into the military did much to create a new warrior class, develop social mobility and to extend the influence of the dynasty into areas of its kingdom that previously would have been untouched. [90] The Kakatiya kings, and in particular the last two, encouraged an egalitarian ethos. The entrenched landed nobility that had existed before the dynasty found its power to be on the wane; the royal gifting of lands formerly in the possession of nobles to people of lesser status did much to effect this dilution. [68]
Religion
Historian P.V.P. Sastry theorizes that the early Kakatiya chiefs were followers of Jainism . A story in the Siddhesvara-charita states that Madhavavarman, an ancestor of the Kakatiyas, obtained military strength by the grace of goddess Padmakshi . The 1123 Govindapuram Jain inscription of Polavasa, another family of feudatory chiefs, contains a similar account of how their ancestor Madhavavarman obtained military strength by the grace of the Jain goddess Yakshesvari. [91]
According to tradition, Prola II became a Veerahaivite , initiated by the Kalamukha preceptor Ramesvara Panditabefor and established Shaivism as his family's religion. The Shaivism-affiliated personal names of the later Kakatiya kings (such as Rudra, Mahadeva, Harihara, and Ganapati) also indicate a shift towards Shaivism. This, according to Sastry, strengthens the theory that the early Kakatiya chiefs were Jains. [5]

In the corporate world, a logo is meant to convey a brand promise. The logo of the government of the new Telangana state , which will come into existence on June 2, has a picture of the Kakatiya arch or the Warangal gate respresenting the Kakatiya dynasty that ruled the region before it came under the Delhi Sultanate.
It also has the more than 400 year old Charminar in Hyderabad. As is apparent, what is highlighted is the rich cultural history of the region and perhaps through it a promise to build on it.
All eyes will now be on the future and on what the new government does as it gets down to work.

Kakatiya Kala Thoranam
The architecture of Telangana dates back over two thousand years.  The Indian state of Telangana is in the Deccan plateau, bordering the coastal plain of Andhra Pradesh .   It has produced regional variants of wider styles of Indian architecture , both in Hindu temple architecture and Indo-Islamic architecture .
Buddhist architecture
[ edit ]
The Nelakondapalli stupa belongs to the Buddhist period.  It is located on the edge of the coastal plain.  ASI excavations in recent decades have found remains of a typical monastic complex, and a few works of art. The site seems to have remained active until the 6th century AD.
Hindu temple architecture
The 7th-century Navabrahma Temples at Alampur were built by the Badami Chalukayas .
Kakatiya
One of the Qutb Shahi tombs .
Golconda Sultanate
Further information: Indo-Islamic architecture § Bahmani and Deccan Sultanates
The architecture of the Golconda Sultanate is very similar to that of other Deccan Sultanates . This Indo-Islamic style is unique to the states of Telangana , Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka and Maharashtra . The ruins of the Golconda Fort is the earliest example. [4] [5] They built elaborate tombs and mosques out of mortared stone.
The 16th-century Charminar , a centerpiece of Hyderabad , is a mosque with four minarets at four corners, elaborately decorated with stucco work. It stands at the confluence of four roads. It overlooks the Mecca Masjid , one of the largest mosques in India. [6]
The Qutb Shahi tombs at Hyderabad contain the tombs of the sultans, other royals and important noblemen. Other examples include the Toli Mosque , Khairtabad Mosque and Taramati Baradari .
Colonial architecture
During the British colonial period , Telangana was ruled by the Nizams of Hyderabad . The seat of the Nizam was Chowmahalla Palace , which showcases a wide variety of Indian and European styles.
Neoclassical
The British Residency [7] and Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad built in the neoclassical style is another great example of this period.
Art Deco
Art deco buildings in Hyderabad include the Monda Market and SBH Building . [8]
Indo-Saracenic
The High Court , City College , Osmania General Hospital and Kacheguda Railway Station in Hyderabad were designed by British architect Vincent Esch in the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture. The Moazzam Jahi market , although not designed by him, is clearly inspired from Esch's designs.[ citation needed ]
Post-Independence
Building built in contemporary styles are common in the HITEC City and surrounding neighborhoods of Hyderabad. IIT Hyderabad is also designed in contemporary style by Christopher Benninger .

Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Hindu concept
Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava is a concept coined by Mahatma Gandhi that embodies the equality of the destination of the paths followed by all religions. [1]
The phrase is attributed to Mahātmā Gāndhi , who first used it in September 1930 in his communications to his followers to quell divisions that had begun to develop between Hindus and Muslims . [2] The concept played a role in Gandhi's movement to unite people belonging to various castes and communities into a huge anti-colonial movement. [3]
The concept is one of the key tenets of secularism in India , which do not separate church and state , but instead is an attempt by the state to embrace all religions. [4] [5] As per Amartya Sen India's pluralism has always been the doctrine of state manifested through its policy of secularism that is based on Upanishads idea of Sarva dharma sama bhav.
Sarva dharma sama bhav is often translated as ""All religions are the same"" or ""All path's lead to the same destination (In a religious sense)"", although its literal meaning is closer to ""Same feeling towards all religions"".

[14] Asia's first hydro-electric power station, still functional, is located at the waterfall. [15] This station was commissioned by the Diwan of Mysore , Sir K. Seshadri Iyer . The electricity produced here was initially used in the Kolar Gold Fields . Thus, Kolar Gold Fields became the first town in Asia to get hydro-electricity.

During the British colonial era from 1700 to 1912, Kolkata was the capital of British India and witnessed a spate of frenzied construction of buildings, largely influenced by the conscious intermingling of Neo-Gothic, Baroque, Neo-Classical, Oriental and Islamic schools of design. Unlike many north Indian cities, whose construction stresses minimalism, the layout of much of the architectural variety in Kolkata owes its origins to European styles and tastes imported by the British and to a much lesser extent, by the Portuguese and French.

Architectural and geographical
The Great Banyan Tree as a whole
The state of West Bengal has significant architectural and natural heritage. The capital of the state, Kolkata is also known as the ""City of Palaces"". It is also known as the ""City of Joy"" as coined by French author Dominique Lappierre through his synonymous book. [6] [7] West Bengal is famous for its terracotta temples of Bishnupur . [8] [9]
Hazarduari Palace , a tourist attraction, is known to have the second largest chandelier in the world and also the largest staircase in India. This three-storey palace was built in 1837 by Duncan McLeod for Nawab Nazim Humaun Jah , the then Nawab of Bengal . The palace was built in the Indo-European style. [10] It derives its name from the thousand doors in the palace (among which only 900 are real). In 1985, the palace was handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for better preservation. [11] [12] The Hazarduari Palace Museum is regarded as the biggest site museum of ASI and has 20 displayed galleries containing 4742 antiquities, 1034 of which are displayed for the public. They include various weapons, oil paintings of Dutch, French and Italian artists, marble statues, rare books, old maps, land revenue records and palanquins (mostly belonging to 18th and 19th centuries). Cooch Behar Palace built in 1887, was designed on the model of Buckingham Palace in London, during the reign of Maharaja Nripendra Narayan .
The Victoria Memorial , Howrah Bridge (Rabindra Setu) and the Second Hooghly Bridge (Vidyasagar Setu) are iconic of Kolkata. Aside from colonial and heritage buildings, there are also high rising monuments and skyscrapers in the city. There are also a couple of cemeteries established by the British when Kolkata was the capital of British India . These include the South Park Street Cemetery and Scottish Cemetery . [13]

The River Ganga flows through the state. [14] World heritage sites in West Bengal include the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway and the Sundarbans National Park . Neora Valley National Park , which is one of the richest biological zones in the entire Northeast, situated in the Kalimpong subdivision under Darjeeling District , is in West Bengal.
The Ganges Delta (also known as the Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta, [15] the Sunderbans Delta, or the Bengalla Delta) is in the South Asia region of Bengal , consisting of West Bengal and its neighbouring country of Bangladesh . It is the world's largest delta, and empties into the Bay of Bengal . It is one of the most fertile regions in the world, thus earning the nickname ""The Green Delta"". It stretches from the Hooghly River on the west to the Meghna River on the east. It is approximately 350 km (220 mi) across at the Bay of Bengal. [15] Kolkata and Haldia are the principal Indian seaports on the delta.
The Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden or Calcutta Botanical Garden (previously known as Indian Botanic Garden) [16] is the largest and oldest reserve of greeneries of its kind in Southeast Asia . It is also a premier institution for botanical and horticultural research in India. The garden is situated on the west bank of the River Hooghly in Shibpur , Howrah , nearly 8 km from center of city Kolkata. Located here is the Great Banyan Tree . It was the widest tree in the world in terms of the area of its canopy and is estimated to be about 200 to 250 years old. It became diseased after it was struck by lightning, so in 1925 the middle of the tree was excised to keep the remainder healthy.
West Bengal also has some more geographical indications like Nakshi Kantha (handicraft), Darjeeling tea (agricultural), Santipore saree (handicraft), Shantiniketan leather goods (handicraft), Fazli mango (agricultural), Khirsapati or Himsagar mango (agricultural), Laxman Bhog mango (agricultural), Baluchari saree (handicraft) and Dhaniakhali saree (handicraft).

Flora and fauna
A Bengal tiger
As of 2009, recorded forest area in the state is 11,879 km2 (4,587 sq mi) which is 13.38% of the state's geographical area, [20] compared to the national average of 21.02%. [21] [22] Part of the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans , is located in southern West Bengal. [23]
The southern part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. [24] The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous sundari (Heritiera fomes), from which the forest gets its name. [25]
The distribution of vegetation in northern West Bengal is dictated by elevation and precipitation . For example, the foothills of the Himalayas, the Dooars , are densely wooded with Sal and other tropical evergreen trees. [26] However, above an elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), the forest becomes predominantly subtropical. In Darjeeling, which is above 1,500 metres (4,900 ft), temperate-forest trees such as oaks , conifers , and rhododendrons predominate. [26]

Wildlife include Indian rhinoceros , Indian elephant , deer, bison , leopard , gaur , tiger and crocodiles, as well as many bird species. Migratory birds come to the state during the winter. [27] The high-altitude forests of Singalila National Park shelter barking deer , red panda , chinkara , takin , serow , pangolin , minivet and Kalij pheasants . The Sundarbans are noted for a reserve project conserving the endangered Bengal tiger , although the forest hosts many other endangered species, such as the Gangetic dolphin , river terrapin and estuarine crocodile . [28] The mangrove forest also acts as a natural fish nursery, supporting coastal fishes along the Bay of Bengal. [28] Recognizing its special conservation value, Sundarban area has been declared as a Biosphere Reserve . [20]
Culture
[ edit ]
The culture of West Bengal attracts tourists from around the world. It has its roots in literature , music , fine arts, drama and cinema . The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region shows a different cultural aspect. Rabindranath Tagore is Asia's first Nobel laureate and composer of India's national anthem . Swami Vivekananda was a key figure in introducing Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and the USA. [29] They all belong from West Bengal, and their houses and residencies like Shantiniketan and Jorasanko Thakur Bari attract many tourists.
West Bengal also has a long tradition of popular literature, music and drama largely based on Bengali folklore and Hindu epics and Puranas .
Baul singers at Basanta-Utsab , Shantiniketan
The Baul tradition is a unique heritage of Bengali folk music, which has also been influenced by regional music traditions. [30] Other folk music forms include Gombhira and Bhawaiya . Folk music in West Bengal is often accompanied by the ektara , a one-stringed instrument. West Bengal also has a heritage in North Indian classical music . "" Rabindrasangeet "", songs composed and set into tune by Rabindranath Tagore, and "" Nazrul geeti "" (by Kazi Nazrul Islam) are popular. Also prominent are other musical forms like Dwijendralal , Atulprasad and Rajanikanta 's songs and ""adhunik"" or modern music from films and other composers.
However, since the early 1990s, there has been an emergence and popularisation of new genres of music, including fusions of Baul and jazz by several Bangla bands , as well as the emergence of Jeebonmukhi Gaan (a modern genre based on realism). Bengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance traditions. Chau dance of Purulia is a rare form of mask dance. West Bengal is known for Bengali folk music such as baul and kirtans and gajan, and modern songs including Bengali ""adhunik"" (modern) songs.

The state is home to a thriving cinema industry , dubbed ""Tollywood"". Tollygunj e in Kolkata is the location of numerous Bengali movie studios, and the name ""Tollywood"" (similar to Hollywood and Bollywood ) is derived from that name. The Bengali film industry is well known for its art films , and has produced acclaimed directors like Satyajit Ray and actors like Uttam Kumar and singers like Arijit Singh .
Among other types of theatre, West Bengal has a tradition of folk drama known as jatra . [31] [32]
West Bengal has been the harbinger of modernism in fine arts.
Kolkata was also the workplace of several social reformers, like Raja Ram Mohan Ray, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar and Swami Vivekananda. These social reforms have eventually led to a cultural atmosphere where practices like sati, dowry and caste-based discrimination or untouchability, the evils that crept into the Hindu society, were abolished.
Kumortuli is a famous tourist attraction in Kolkata. It is traditionally a potters' quarter in North Kolkata. By virtue of their artistic productions these potters have moved from obscurity to prominence. This Kolkata neighbourhood not only supplies clay idols of Hindu gods and goddesses to barowari pujas in Kolkata and its neighbourhoods, but also exports a number of idols. It is one of the seven wonders in Kolkata. [33] Bengal is also well known for its variety of handwoven Sarees. [34] It is home to exquisite sarees such as Jamdani Sarees, Baluchari Sarees, [35] Kantha stitch Sarees, Tussar Silk Sarees, Muslin Sarees and Matka Sarees. These variety of handwoven sarees in a single place is a rarity in today's modern times.
Cuisine
[ edit ]
Rice and fish are traditional favourite foods, leading to a saying in Bengali, machhe bhate bangali ( Bengali language :মাছে ভাতে বাঙালী) that translates as ""fish and rice make a Bengali"". [36] Bengal's vast repertoire of fish-based dishes includes hilsa preparations, a favourite among Bengalis. There are numerous ways of cooking fish depending on the texture, size, fat content and bones.
Sweets occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and at their social ceremonies. It is an ancient custom among both Hindu and Muslim Bengalis to distribute sweets during festivities. The confectionery industry has flourished because of its close association with social and religious ceremonies. Competition and changing tastes have helped to create many new sweets. Bengalis make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including rôshogolla , chômchôm, kalojam and several kinds of sondesh . Pitha , a kind of sweet cake, bread or dim sum are specialties of winter season. Sweets like coconut-naru, til-naru, moa, and payesh are prepared during the festival of Lakshmi puja. Popular street food includes aloor chop, beguni , kati roll and phuchka . [37] [38]

The Tibetan ethnic groups like the Lepchas, Bhutias, Gurungs, and Tamangs celebrate new year called Losar in January/February, Maghe Sankranti , Chotrul Duchen , Buddha Jayanti and Tendong Lho Rumfaat , to name a few, which provide the ""regional distinctness"" of Darjeeling's local culture from the rest of West Bengal. [39]
A popular food in Darjeeling is the momo , a steamed dumpling containing either mutton, pork, beef or vegetables cooked in a doughy wrapping served with a watery vegetable soup and spicy tomato sauce/chutney. Wai-Wai is a favourite packaged snack of Darjeeling hills comprising noodles which are eaten either dry or with soup.

Tourism in India is 4.6% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike other sectors, tourism is not a priority sector for the Government of India . The World Travel and Tourism Council calculated that tourism generated ₹13.2 lakh crore (US$150 billion) or 5.8% of India 's GDP and supported 32.1 million jobs in 2021. Even though, these numbers were lower than the pre-pandemic figures; the country's economy witnessed a significant growth in 2021 after the massive downturn during 2020. The sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 7.8% to ₹33.8 lakh crore (US$390 billion) by 2031 (7.2% of GDP). [1] India has established itself as the 5th largest global travel healthcare destination with an estimated market size of around $9 billion in 2019, out of the total global travel healthcare industry of $44.8 billion(2019). [2] [3] In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients travelled to India to seek medical treatment. [4]
According to the Ministry of Tourism , over 6.19 million and 1.52 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2022 and 2021 respectively compared to 10.93 million in 2019, representing a -44% degrowth. [5] [6] This makes India the 22nd most visited nation in the world and 8th in Asia and Pacific . [7] In 2022, Gujarat Tops India in Foreign Tourism with 20.17% Share in 2022. Gujarat rose as a global tourism hotspot continues with over 15.40 lakh tourists visiting in 2023. [8] In 2023, 2509.63 million Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) were recorded (provisionally) compared to 1731.01 Million DTVs in 2022. [9]
The World Economic Forum 's Travel and Tourism Development Index 2021, which replaced its previous Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report , ranks India 54th out of 117 countries overall. [10] The last edition of the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, published in 2019, had ranked India 34th out of 140 countries overall. The report ranked the price competitiveness of India's tourism sector 13th out of 140 countries. It mentioned that India has quite good air transport infrastructure (ranked 33rd), particularly given the country's stage of development, and reasonable ground and port infrastructure (ranked 28th). The country also scored high on natural resources (ranked 14th), and cultural resources and business travel (ranked 8th). [11] The World Tourism Organization reported that India's receipts from tourism during 2012 ranked 16th in the world, and 7th among Asian and Pacific countries. [12]
The Ministry of Tourism designs national policies for the development and promotion of tourism. In the process, the Ministry consults and collaborates with other stakeholders in the sector including various central ministries / agencies , state governments , union territories and private sector representatives. Concerted efforts are being made to promote niche tourism products such as rural, cruise, medical and eco-tourism. [13] The Ministry of Tourism maintains the Incredible India campaign focused on promoting tourism in India.
Visa policy of India
Main article: Visa policy of India
India requires citizens of most countries to hold a valid passport and apply for a travel visa at their local Indian embassy or consulate before their visit. Travellers can apply directly by mail or in person, or through their local travel services company . In 2014, India implemented an online method for citizens of 156 countries to apply for an e-Tourist Visa . [14] [15]
Nationals of Bhutan , Maldives , and Nepal do not require a travel visa to enter India. Citizens of Afghanistan, Argentina , Bangladesh, DPR Korea, Jamaica, Maldives, Mauritius, Mongolia, Nepal, South Africa and Uruguay are not required to pay a fee when obtaining an Indian visa. [16] [17]
During the pandemic year 2020, India had access to just 23 countries for travel, whereas now the Indian passport holders can travel visa-free to 60 countries. [18]
A Protected Area Permit (PAP) is required to enter the states of Nagaland and Sikkim and some parts of the states of Arunachal Pradesh , Himachal Pradesh , Jammu and Kashmir , Manipur , Mizoram , Rajasthan and Uttarakhand . A Restricted Area Permit (RAP) is required to enter the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and parts of Sikkim . Special permits are needed to visit the Lakshadweep islands. [19]
e-Tourist Visa
As a measure to boost tourism, [20] the Indian Government implemented a new visa policy in November 2014, allowing tourists and business visitors to obtain a ""visa on arrival"" at 28 international airports, by acquiring an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) online before arrival, without having to visit an Indian consulate or visa centre. [21] In April 2015, the ""visa on arrival"" scheme was renamed ""e-Tourist Visa"" (or ""e-TV"") to avoid confusion. [22]
The e-Tourist Visa facility requires a tourist to apply online on a secure Government of India website, at least four to thirty days before the date of travel. If approved, the visitor must print and carry the approved visa with their travel documents. The visa allows holders of an ETA to enter and stay anywhere in India for a period of ninety days except for citizens of US, UK, Japan and Canada. Citizens of these countries can stay for up to 180 days at a time. an ETA can be obtained twice in a single calendar year. [14]
India first introduced its ""visa on arrival"" facility on 27 November 2014, to citizens of the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Cook Islands, Djibouti, Fiji, Finland, Germany, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Laos, Luxembourg, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Myanmar, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Norway, Oman, Palau, Palestine , Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Russia, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Thailand, Tonga, Tuvalu, UAE, Ukraine, USA, Vanuatu and Vietnam. [14] On 30 July 2015, the facility was extended to China, Macau and Hong Kong.

In the 2011 Census of India , an urban agglomeration was defined as ""An urban agglomeration is a continuous urban spread constituting a town and its adjoining outgrowths, or two or more physically contiguous towns together with or without outgrowths of such towns. An Urban Agglomeration must consist of at least a statutory town and its total population (i.e. all the constituents put together) should not be less than 20,000 as per the 2001 Census."" [1] [2] [3]

Nalgonda - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalgonda,"[ edit ]
There is archaeological evidence that Paleolithic people lived in the area that is now Nalgonda, fashioning tools and weapons out of stone.  Some of these implements have been found in the Nalgonda area, similar to those discovered at the Sloan archaeological site in Arkansas .
Neolithic Age
Traces of Neolithic culture were found at Chota Yelupu, where sling stones and other contemporary objects were excavated.  Evidence of Megalithic culture was also found via the discovery of innumerable burials at various places around Nalgonda.
The Mauryas and Satavahanas (230 BC – 218 BC)
[ edit ]
The political history of the Nalgonda district commences with the Mauryas .  During the reign of Ashoka the Great, the Mauryas maintained control over the Nalgonda region.  Later, the Satavahanas , who ruled between 230 BC and 218 BC, took control of the area.
During this period, the region established trade contacts with the Roman Empire .
Ikshvakus (227 AD – 306 AD)
In 227 AD, the Ikshvaku dynasty took control of the region.  During this period, members of various Saka tribes migrated to the area. Buddhism flourished during this time.
Invasion of Samudragupta
[ edit ]
After the Ikshvakus, the Pallavas and Yadavas fought for supremacy over the region.  However, after Samudragupta (c. 335 AD – c. 375 AD) invaded and conquered most of India, the area fell under the control of his Gupta Empire .  The Empire fell in the 6th century.
The Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas
[ edit ]
Starting in the 6th century, the Chalukya dynasty ruled the modern-day Nalgonda region, as well as much of southern and central India.  A major portion of the Nalgonda area appears to have passed from the Chalukyas of Badami to the Rashtrakutas .  However, the Rashtrakutas fell in 973, and power shifted to the Chalukyas of Kalyani .  The Chalukyas continued to rule the area until the end of the 12th century.
Medieval period
[ edit ]
During the medieval era, the Kakatiya dynasty took control of the region from the western Chalukyas.  During the reign of Prataparudra II , in 1323, the kingdom was annexed to the Tughluq Empire.
When Muhammad bin Tughluq ruled (around 1324–1351), Musunuri chief Kapayanayaka ceded a part of Nalgonda to Ala-ud-din Hasan Bahman Shah of the Bahmani Sultanate.  He annexed the region to the Bahmani Kingdom.
In 1455, Jalal Khan he declared himself king at Nalgonda, but this was short-lived.  He was quickly defeated and the region brought back to the Bahmani Kingdom.
During the time of the Bahmani Sultan Shihabud-din Mahmun, Sultan Quli was appointed as tarafdar of the Telangana region (now the state of Telangana).  Quli's son, Jamshid, took control of the region from his father.  Later, Qutub Shahis took control of the region, and maintained it until 1687.
Modern period: Mughals and Asaf Jahis
[ edit ]
Nizam-ul-Mulk ( Asaf Jah I ) defeated Mubasiz Khan at Shaker Khere in Berar and ruled the Deccan autonomously.  This district, like the other districts of Telangana, was controlled by Asaf Jahis , and remained under their rule for nearly two hundred and twenty-five years.

Arch - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch,")
Rossgraben bridge ( Rüeggisberg ) near Bern, Switzerland, showing the hinge at mid-span of this three-hinged arch.
The practical arch bridges are built either as a fixed arch, a two-hinged arch, or a three-hinged arch. [103] The fixed arch is most often used in reinforced concrete bridges and tunnels, which have short spans. Because it is subject to additional internal stress from thermal expansion and contraction, this kind of arch is statically indeterminate (the internal state is impossible to determine based on the external forces alone). [45]
The two-hinged arch is most often used to bridge long spans. [45] This kind of arch has pinned connections at its base. Unlike that of the fixed arch, the pinned base can rotate, [104] thus allowing the structure to move freely and compensate for the thermal expansion and contraction that changes in outdoor temperature cause. However, this can result in additional stresses, and therefore the two-hinged arch is also statically indeterminate, although not as much as the fixed arch. [45]
The three-hinged arch is not only hinged at its base, like the two-hinged arch, yet also at its apex. The additional apical connection allows the three-hinged arch to move in two opposite directions and compensate for any expansion and contraction. This kind of arch is thus not subject to additional stress from thermal change. Unlike the other two kinds of arch, the three-hinged arch is therefore statically determinate. [103] It is most often used for spans of medial length, such as those of roofs of large buildings. Another advantage of the three-hinged arch is that the reaction of the pinned bases is more predictable than the one for the fixed arch, allowing shallow, bearing-type foundations in spans of medial length. In the three-hinged arch ""thermal expansion and contraction of the arch will cause vertical movements at the peak pin joint but will have no appreciable effect on the bases,"" which further simplifies foundational design. [45]
History
The arch became popular in the Roman times and mostly spread alongside the European influence, although it was known and occasionally used much earlier. Many ancient architectures avoided the use of arches, including the Viking and Hindu ones. [2]
Bronze Age: ancient Near East
[ edit ]
True arches, as opposed to corbel arches , were known by a number of civilizations in the ancient Near East including the Levant , but their use was infrequent and mostly confined to underground structures, such as drains where the problem of lateral thrust is greatly diminished. [105] An example of the latter would be the Nippur arch, built before 3800 BC, [106] and dated by H. V. Hilprecht (1859–1925) to even before 4000 BC. [107] Rare exceptions are an arched mudbrick home doorway dated to c. 2000 BC from Tell Taya in Iraq [108] and two Bronze Age arched Canaanite city gates, one at Ashkelon (dated to c. 1850 BC), [109] and one at Tel Dan (dated to c. 1750 BC), both in modern-day Israel . [110] [111] An Elamite tomb dated 1500 BC from Haft Teppe contains a parabolic vault which is considered one of the earliest evidences of arches in Iran.
The use of true arches in Egypt also originated in the 4th millennium BC (underground barrel vaults at the Dendera cemetery). Standing arches were known since at least the Third Dynasty , but very few examples survived, since the arches were mostly used in non-durable secular buildings and made of mud brick voussoirs that were not wedge-shaped, but simply held in place by mortar , and thus susceptible to a collapse (the oldest arch still standing is at Ramesseum ). Sacred buildings exhibited either lintel design or corbelled arches. Arches were mostly missing in Egypt temples even after the Roman conquest , even though Egyptians thought of the arch as a spiritual shape and used it in the rock-cut tombs and portable shrines. [112] Auguste Mariette suggested that this choice was based on a relative fragility of a vault: ""what would remain of the tombs and temples of Egyptians today, if they had preferred the vault?"" [27]
Mycenaean architecture utilized only the corbel arches in their beehive tombs with triangular openings. [112] Mycenaeans had also built probably the oldest still standing[ citation needed ] stone-arch bridge in the world, Arkadiko Bridge , in Greece.
As evidenced by their imitations of the parabolic arches, Hittites most likely were exposed to the Egyptian designs, but used the corbelled technique to build them. [112]

Classical Persia and Greece
[ edit ]
The Assyrians , also apparently under the Egyptian influence, adopted the true arch (with a slightly pointed profile) early in the 8th century. [112] In ancient Persia , the Achaemenid Empire (550 BC–330 BC) built small barrel vaults (essentially a series of arches built together to form a hall) known as iwan , which became massive, monumental structures during the later Parthian Empire (247 BC–AD 224). [113] [114] [115] This architectural tradition was continued by the Sasanian Empire (224–651), which built the Taq Kasra at Ctesiphon in the 6th century AD, the largest free-standing vault until modern times. [116]
An early European example of a voussoir arch appears in the 4th century BC Greek Rhodes Footbridge . [117] [118] Proto-true arches can also be found under the stairs of the temple of Apollo at Didyma and the stadium at Olympia . [30] .

Ancient Rome
[ edit ]
The ancient Romans learned the semicircular arch from the Etruscans (both cultures apparently adopted the design in the 4th century BC [30] ), refined it and were the first builders in Europe to tap its full potential for above ground buildings:
The Romans were the first builders in Europe, perhaps the first in the world, to fully appreciate the advantages of the arch, the vault and the dome. [119]
Throughout the Roman Empire , from Syria to Scotland , engineers erected arch structures. The first use of arches was for civic structures, like drains and city gates. Later the arches were utilized for major civic buildings bridges and aqueducts , with the outstanding 1st century AD examples provided by the Colosseum , Pont Du Gard , and the aqueduct of Segovia . [30] The introduction of the ceremonial triumphal arch dates back to Roman Republic , although the best examples are from the imperial times ( Arch of Augustus at Susa, Arch of Titus ). [30]
Romans initially avoided using the arch in the religious buildings and, in Rome, arched temples were quite rare until the recognition of Christianity in 313 AD (with the exceptions provided by the Pantheon and the ""temple of Minerva Medica"" [ verification needed ]). Away from the capital, arched temples were more common ( temple of Hadrian at Ephesus [ de ], temple of Jupiter at Sbeitla , Severan temple at Djemila ). [30] Arrival of Christianity prompted creation of the new type of temple, a Christian basilica , that made a thorough break with the pagan tradition with arches as one of the main elements of the design, along with the  exposed brick walls ( Santa Sabina in Rome, Sant'Apollinare in Classe ). For a long period, from the late 5th century to the 20th century, arcades were a standard staple for the Western Christian architecture . [30]
Vaults began to be used for roofing large interior spaces such as halls and temples, a function that was also assumed by domed structures from the 1st century BC onwards.
The segmental arch was first built by the Romans who realized that an arch in a bridge did not have to be a semicircle, [120] [121] such as in Alconétar Bridge or Ponte San Lorenzo . The utilitarian and mass residential ( insulae ) buildings, as found in Ostia Antica and Pompeii , mostly used low segmental arches made of bricks and architraves made of wood, while the concrete lintel arches can be found in villas and palaces.

Ancient China
[ edit ]
Ancient architecture of China (and Japan) used mostly timber-framed construction and trabeated system. [5] Arches were little-used, although there are few arch bridges known from literature and one artistic depiction in stone-carved relief . [122] [123] [124] Since the only surviving artefacts of architecture from the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) are rammed earth defensive walls and towers, ceramic roof tiles from no longer existent wooden buildings, [125] [126] [127] stone gate towers , [128] [129] and underground brick tombs, the known vaults, domes, and archways were built with the support of the earth and were not free-standing. [130] [131]
China's oldest surviving stone arch bridge is the Anji Bridge . Still in use, it was built between 595 CE and 605 CE during the Sui dynasty . [132] [133]

Islamic
[ edit ]
Islamic architects adopted the Roman arches, but had quickly shown their resourcefulness: by the 8th century the simple semicircular arch was almost entirely replaced with fancier shapes, few fine examples of the former in the Umayyad architecture notwithstanding (cf. the Great Mosque of Damascus , 706–715 CE). The first pointed arches appear already at the end of the 7th century AD ( Al-Aqsa Mosque , Palace of Ukhaidhir , cisterns at the White Mosque of Ramle [134] [135] ). Their variations spread fast and wide: Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo (876-879 AD), Nizamiyya Madrasa at Khar Gerd (now Iran , 11th century), Kongo Mosque in Diani Beach ( Kenya , 16th century). [72] [135]
Islamic architecture brought to life a large amount of arch forms: the round horseshoe arch that became a characteristic trait of the Islamic buildings, the keel arch , the cusped arch ,  and the mixed-line arch (where the curved ""ogee swell"" is interspersed with abrupt bends). [135] The Great Mosque of Cordoba , that can be considered a catalogue of Islamic arches, contains also the arches with almost straight sides, trefoil , interlaced , and joggled . Mosque of Ibn Tulun adds four-centred and stilted version of the pointed arch. [72]
It is quite likely that the appearance of the pointed arch, an essential element of the Gothic style , in Europe ( Monte Cassino , 1066–1071 AD, and the Cluny Abbey five years later) and the ogee arch in Venice ( c. 1250) is a result of the Islamic influence, [72] possibly through Sicily . [136] Saoud [137] also credits to Islamic architects the spread of the transverse arch . Mixed-line arch became popular in the Mudéjar style and subsequently spread around the Spanish-speaking world.

Western Europe
[ edit ]
The collapse of the Western Roman Empire left the church as the only client of major construction; with all pre-Romanesque architectural styles borrowing from Roman construction with its semicircular arch. Due to the decline in the construction quality, the walls were thicker, and the arches thus heavier, than their Roman prototypes. Eventually the architects started to use the depth of the arches for decoration, turning the deep opening into an arch order (or rebated arch, a sequence of progressively smaller concentric arches, each inset with a rebate ). [138]
Romanesque style started experiments with the pointed arch late in the 11th century ( Cluny Abbey ). In few decades, the practice spread ( Durham Cathedral , Basilica of Saint-Denis ). Early Gothic utilized the flexibility of the pointed arch by grouping together arches of different spans but with the same height. [138]
While the arches used in the mediaeval Europe were borrowed from the Roman and Islamic architecture, the use of pointed arch to form the rib vault was novel and became the defining characteristic of Gothic construction. At about 1400 AD, the city-states of Italy, where the pointed arch had never gotten much traction, initiated the revival of the Roman style with its round arches, Renaissance . By the 16th century the new style spread across Europe and, through the influence of empires, to the rest of the world. Arch became a dominant architectural form until the introduction of the new construction materials, like steel and concrete. [138]
India
[ edit ]
The history of arch in India is very long (some arches were apparently found in excavations of Kosambi , 2nd millennium BC . However, the continuous history begins with rock-cut arches in the Lomas Rishi cave (3rd century BC). [72] Vaulted roof of an early Harappan burial chamber has been noted at Rakhigarhi . [139] S.R Rao reports vaulted roof of a small chamber in a house from Lothal . [140] Barrel vaults were also used in the Late Harappan Cemetery H culture dated 1900 BC-1300 BC which formed the roof of the metal working furnace, the discovery was made by Vats in 1940 during excavation at Harappa. [141] [142] [143]
The use of arches until the Islamic conquest of India in the 12th century AD was sporadic, with ogee arches and barrel vaults in rock-cut temples ( Karla Caves , from the 1st century BC) and decorative pointed gavaksha arches. By the 5th century AD voussoir vaults were used structurally in the brick construction. Surviving examples include the temple at Bhitargaon (5th century AD) and Mahabodhi temple (7th century AD), the latter has both pointed arches and semicircular arches . [72] [144] These Gupta era arch vault system was later used extensively in Burmese Buddhist temples in Pyu and Bagan in 11th and 12th centuries. [145]
With the arrival of Islamic and other Western Asia influence, the arches became prominent in the Indian architecture, although the post and lintel construction was still preferred. A variety of pointed and lobed arches was characteristic for the Indo-Islamic architecture , with the monumental example of Buland Darwaza , that has pointed arch decorated with small cusped arches . [72]

Pre-Columbian America
Mayan architecture utilized the corbel arches. The other Mesoamerican cultures used only the flat roofs with no arches whatsoever, [146] although some researchers had suggested that both Maya and Aztec architects understood the concept of a true arch. [147] [148]
Revival of the trabeated system
[ edit ]
The 19th-century introduction of the wrought iron (and later steel ) into construction changed the role of the arch. Due to the high tensile strength of new materials, relatively long lintels became possible, as was demonstrated  by the tubular Britannia Bridge ( Robert Stephenson , 1846-1850). A fervent proponent of the trabeated system, Alexander ""Greek"" Thomson , whose preference for lintels was originally based on aesthetic criteria, observed that the spans of this bridge are longer than that of any arch ever built, thus ""the simple, unsophisticated stone lintel contains in its structure all the scientific appliances [...] used in the great tubular bridge. [...] Stonehenge is more scientifically constructed than York Minster ."" [149] Use of arches in bridge construction continued (the Britannia Bridge was rebuilt in 1972 as a truss arch bridge ), yet the steel frames and reinforced concrete frames mostly replaced the arches as the load-bearing elements in buildings.

As a pure compression form, the utility of the arch is due to many building materials, including stone and unreinforced concrete , being strong under compression , but brittle when tensile stress is applied to them. [150]
Masonry
[ edit ]
The voussoirs can be wedge-shaped or have a form of a rectangular cuboid , in the latter case the wedge-like shape is provided by the mortar . [92]
An arch is held in place by the weight of all of its members, making construction problematic. One answer is to build a frame (historically, of wood) which exactly follows the form of the underside of the arch. This is known as a centre or centring . Voussoirs are laid on it until the arch is complete and self-supporting. For an arch higher than head height, scaffolding would be required, so it could be combined with the arch support. Arches may fall when the frame is removed if design or construction has been faulty.[ citation needed ]
Old arches sometimes need reinforcement due to decay of the keystones , forming what is known as bald arch .
Reinforced concrete
[ edit ]
In reinforced concrete construction, the principle of the arch is used so as to benefit from the concrete's strength in resisting compressive stress. Where any other form of stress is raised, such as tensile or torsional stress, it has to be resisted by carefully placed reinforcement rods or fibres. [151]
Architectural styles
[ edit ]
The type of arches (or absence of them) is one of the most prominent characteristics of an architectural style . For example, when Heinrich Hübsch , in the 19th century, tried to classify the architectural style, his ""primary elements"" were roof and supports, with the top-level basic types: trabeated (no arches) and arcuated (arch-based). His next division for the arcuated styles was based on the use of round and pointed arch shapes. [152]
Cultural references
[ edit ]
The steady horizontal push of an arch against the abutments gave rise to a saying ""the arch never sleeps"", attributed to many sources, from Hindu [153] to Arabs . [27] This adage stresses that the arch carries ""a seed of death"" for itself and the structure containing it, a statement that can be made upon observation of the Roman ruins. [27] The plot of The Nebuly Coat by J. Meade Falkner , inspired by a collapse of a tower at the Chichester Cathedral plays with the idea while dealing with the slow disintegration of a church building. [153] Saoud [154] explains the proverb by chain-like self-balancing of the horizontal and vertical forces in the arch and its ""universal adaptability"". [155]

The roads used to be pathetic some time ago, but thanks to the proactive lead taken by the local resident groups from Nizampet and Nizampet Village , no more struggles with bad roads but especially in the rainy season. People are unhappy with the roads due to Water clogging on the roads, there is no security on the roads if it is raining heavily.

There are no water-harvesting pits at Nizampet and Nizampet Village.

Ramappa Temple - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramappa_Temple,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
13th century Kakatiya Hindu temple in Telangana
""Ramappa"" redirects here. For the lake, see Ramappa Lake .
Ramappa Temple
Shiva as Ramalingeshwara Swamy [1]
Festivals
Official name: Kakatiya Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple, Telangana
Criteria
1570
Ramappa Temple, also known as the Rudreshwara temple, is a Kakatiya style Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva , located in Palampet village, Mulugu district , Telangana, India . It is 15 km (9.3 mi) from Mulugu , 66 km (41 mi) from Warangal , 209 km (130 mi) from Hyderabad . An inscription in the temple says it was constructed in the year 1213 CE by Recharla Rudra Reddy —a general of Kakatiya ruler Ganapati Deva ( r. 1199–1262). [1] [2] [3] Located in the vicinity of Ramappa Lake , the Ramappa Temple complex which consist of three temples was constructed between 1212 and 1234, designed and architect by Ramappa—after whom the temple complex is named. [4] [5] Marco Polo , during his visit to the Kakatiya empire, supposedly called the temple ""the brightest star in the galaxy of temples"". [6] In July 2021, Ramappa Temple was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . [7] [8]
Structure
[ edit ]
Ramappa Temple stands on a 6-foot (1.8 m) high star-shaped platform. The hall in front of the sanctum has numerous carved pillars that have been positioned to create an effect that combines light and space wonderfully. The temple is named after the sculptor Ramappa, who built it, making it the only temple in India to be named after its craftsman. [6]
The main structure is in a reddish sandstone , but the columns around the outside have large brackets of black basalt which is rich in iron, magnesium and silica. These are carved as mythical animals or female dancers or musicians, and are ""the masterpieces of Kakatiya art, notable for their delicate carving, sensuous postures, and elongated bodies and heads"". [9] On 25 July 2021, the temple was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as ""Kakatiya Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple, Telangana"". [2] [10]
Restoration by 7th nizam
[ edit ]
The 7th Nizam of Hyderabad also donated towards restoration of the temple, with the restoration works starting in 1914. [11]
In 1931, Dr. Ghulam Yazdani, the world famous Indian Archeologist and Conservationist who established Hyderabad Archaeology Department under the Nizam Government, had traced the decorations and ornaments of the temple which were missing and restored them in its original positions. [12]
Description
[ edit ]
The roof (garbhalayam) of the temple is built with bricks, which are so light that they can float on water. [13]
Some bricks of the Ramappa temple and Humayun's tomb were sent for examination to Dr. Habib Haman, Chief Chemist of Government Industrial Laboratory, Hyderabad, Dn. He has kindly reported as follows: 'The samples of floating bricks from Bidar are similar to those from Warangal as far as the method of manufacture is concerned. The material used to make the brick spongy was apparently saw-dust. The weight of the specimens is
1⁄3 to
1⁄4 of the ordinary bricks of the same size. The Bidar specimens show better quality as regards homogeneous mixing and uniform burning than their proto-types from Ramappa, as a result of which the porosity is well-maintained in the body of bricks from Bidar and they float well in water. [14]
There are two small Shiva shrines on either side of the main temple. The enormous Nandi within, facing the shrine of Shiva, remains in good condition.[ citation needed ]
Nataraja Ramakrishna revived Perini Shivatandavam (Perini Dance), by seeing the sculptures in this temple. [15] [16] The dance poses, written in Nrtta Ratnavali by Jayapa Senani , also appear in these sculptures. [17]
The temple remained intact even after repeated wars, plunder and destruction during wars and natural disasters. There was a major earthquake during the 17th century which caused some damage. It survived the earthquake due to its 'sandbox technique' of laying foundation. [18]
Many of the smaller structures were neglected and are in ruins. The Archaeological Survey of India has taken charge of it. The main entrance gate in the outer wall of the temple is ruined. [19]
Location
[ edit ]
Ramappa temple is located in Palampet, Venkatapur mandal which is 19 km (12 mi) from Mulugu mandal (around 70 km (43 mi) off Warangal city). It is located 6 km (3.7 mi) away from Kota Gullu where another Shiva temple is located.[ citation needed ]

The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church , with 1.28 to 1.39 billion baptized Catholics worldwide as of 2024. [4] [5] [9] It is among the world's oldest and largest international institutions and has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilization . [10] [11] [12] [13] The church consists of 24 sui iuris churches , including the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches , which comprise almost 3,500 dioceses and eparchies around the world . [14] The pope , who is the bishop of Rome, is the chief pastor of the church. [15] The Diocese of Rome , known as the Holy See , is the central governing authority of the church. The administrative body of the Holy See, the Roman Curia , has its principal offices in Vatican City , which is a small, independent city-state and enclave within the city of Rome , of which the pope is head of state and absolute elective monarch .
Of its seven sacraments , the Eucharist is the principal one, celebrated liturgically in the Mass . [24] The church teaches that through consecration by a priest , the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ . The Virgin Mary is venerated as the Perpetual Virgin , Mother of God , and Queen of Heaven ; she is honoured in dogmas and devotions . [25] Catholic social teaching emphasizes voluntary support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy . The Catholic Church operates tens of thousands of Catholic schools, universities and colleges , hospitals , and orphanages around the world, and is the largest non-government provider of education and health care in the world. [26] Among its other social services are numerous charitable and humanitarian organizations.
The Catholic Church has profoundly influenced Western philosophy , culture , art , literature , music , law , [27] and science . [13] Catholics live all over the world through missions , immigration , diaspora , and conversions . Since the 20th century, the majority have resided in the Global South , partially due to secularization in Europe and North America. The Catholic Church shared communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church until the East–West Schism in 1054, disputing particularly the authority of the pope . Before the Council of Ephesus in AD 431, the Church of the East also shared in this communion, as did the Oriental Orthodox Churches before the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451; all separated primarily over differences in Christology . The Eastern Catholic Churches, which have a combined membership of approximately 18 million, represent a body of Eastern Christians who returned or remained in communion with the pope during or following these schisms for a variety of historical circumstances. In the 16th century, the Reformation led to the formation of separate, Protestant groups.  From the late 20th century, the Catholic Church has been criticized for its teachings on sexuality , its doctrine against ordaining women , and its handling of sexual abuse cases involving clergy.
Name
Further information: Catholic (term) and Roman Catholic (term)
The first use of the term ""Catholic Church"", meaning ""universal church"", was by the church father Saint Ignatius of Antioch in his Letter to the Smyrnaeans in c. 110 AD. [28] Ignatius of Antioch also is credited with the first recorded use of the term Christianity ten years earlier, in c. 100 AD. [29] He died in Rome, with his relics located in San Clemente al Laterano .
Catholic (from Greek : καθολικός,
romanized :
katholikḕ ekklēsía) occurred in the letter written about 110 AD from Saint Ignatius of Antioch to the Smyrnaeans , [note 2] which read: ""Wheresoever the bishop shall appear, there let the people be, even as where Jesus may be, there is the universal [katholike] Church."" [31] In the Catechetical Lectures (c. 350) of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem , the name ""Catholic Church"" was used to distinguish it from other groups that also called themselves ""the church"". [31] [32] The ""Catholic"" notion was further stressed in the edict De fide Catolica issued 380 by Theodosius I , the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire , when establishing the state church of the Roman Empire . [33]
Since the East–West Schism of 1054, the Eastern Orthodox Church has taken the adjective Orthodox as its distinctive epithet; its official name continues to be the Orthodox Catholic Church. [34] The Latin Church was described as Catholic, with that description also denominating those in communion with the Holy See after the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, when those who ceased to be in communion became known as Protestants. [35] [36]
While the Roman Church has been used to describe the pope's Diocese of Rome since the Fall of the Western Roman Empire and into the Early Middle Ages (6th–10th century), Roman Catholic Church has been applied to the whole church in the English language since the Protestant Reformation in the late 16th century. [37] Further, some will refer to the Latin Church as Roman Catholic in distinction from the Eastern Catholic churches. [38] ""Roman Catholic"" has occasionally appeared also in documents produced both by the Holy See, [note 3] and notably used by certain national episcopal conferences and local dioceses. [note 4]
The name Catholic Church for the whole church is used in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1990) and the Code of Canon Law (1983). ""Catholic Church"" is also used in the documents of the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), [39] the First Vatican Council (1869–1870), [40] the Council of Trent (1545–1563), [41] and numerous other official documents. [42] [43]
History
A c. 1481–1482 fresco by Pietro Perugino in the Sistine Chapel showing Jesus giving the keys of heaven to Saint Peter
The Last Supper , a late 1490s mural painting by Leonardo da Vinci , depicting the Last Supper of Jesus and his twelve apostles on the eve of his crucifixion . Most of Jesus' apostles are buried in Rome , including Saint Peter.
The New Testament , in particular the Gospels , records Jesus' activities and teaching, his appointment of the Twelve Apostles and his Great Commission of the apostles, instructing them to continue his work. [44] [45] The book Acts of Apostles , tells of the founding of the Christian church and the spread of its message to the Roman Empire. [46] The Catholic Church teaches that its public ministry began on Pentecost , occurring fifty days following the date Christ is believed to have resurrected . [47] At Pentecost, the apostles are believed to have received the Holy Spirit, preparing them for their mission in leading the church. [48] [49] The Catholic Church teaches that the college of bishops , led by the bishop of Rome are the successors to the Apostles. [50]
In the account of the Confession of Peter found in the Gospel of Matthew , Christ designates Peter as the ""rock"" upon which Christ's church will be built. [51] [52] The Catholic Church considers the bishop of Rome, the pope, to be the successor to Saint Peter . [53] Some scholars state Peter was the first bishop of Rome. [54] Others[ who? ] say that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome. [55] Many scholars hold that a church structure of plural presbyters/bishops persisted in Rome until the mid-2nd century, when the structure of a single bishop and plural presbyters was adopted, [56] and that later writers retrospectively applied the term ""bishop of Rome"" to the most prominent members of the clergy in the earlier period and also to Peter himself. [56] On this basis protestant scholars Oscar Cullmann , [57] Henry Chadwick , [58] and Bart D. Ehrman [59] question whether there was a formal link between Peter and the modern papacy. Raymond E. Brown also says that it is anachronistic to speak of Peter in terms of local bishop of Rome, but that Christians of that period would have looked on Peter as having ""roles that would contribute in an essential way to the development of the role of the papacy in the subsequent church"". These roles, Brown says, ""contributed enormously to seeing the bishop of Rome, the bishop of the city where Peter died and where Paul witnessed the truth of Christ, as the successor of Peter in care for the church universal"". [56]
Antiquity and Roman Empire

Conditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empire's network of roads and waterways facilitated travel, and the Pax Romana made travelling safe. The empire encouraged the spread of a common culture with Greek roots, which allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood. [60]
Unlike most religions in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see Idolatry ). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians—including government authorities—to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalized in the 4th century. [61]
In 313, Emperor Constantine I 's Edict of Milan legalized Christianity, and in 330 Constantine moved the imperial capital to Constantinople , modern Istanbul, Turkey . In 380 the Edict of Thessalonica made Nicene Christianity the state church of the Roman Empire , a position that within the diminishing territory of the Byzantine Empire would persist until the empire itself ended in the fall of Constantinople in 1453, while elsewhere the church was independent of the empire, as became particularly clear with the East–West Schism . During the period of the Seven Ecumenical Councils , five primary sees emerged, an arrangement formalized in the mid-6th century by Emperor Justinian I as the pentarchy of Rome, Constantinople , Antioch , Jerusalem and Alexandria . [62] [63] In 451 the Council of Chalcedon , in a canon of disputed validity, [64] elevated the see of Constantinople to a position ""second in eminence and power to the bishop of Rome"". [65] From c. 350 – c. 500, the bishops, or popes, of Rome, steadily increased in authority through their consistent intervening in support of orthodox leaders in theological disputes, which encouraged appeals to them. [66] Emperor Justinian , who in the areas under his control definitively established a form of caesaropapism , [67] in which ""he had the right and duty of regulating by his laws the minutest details of worship and discipline, and also of dictating the theological opinions to be held in the Church"", [68] re-established imperial power over Rome and other parts of the West, initiating the period termed the Byzantine Papacy (537–752), during which the bishops of Rome, or popes, required approval from the emperor in Constantinople or from his representative in Ravenna for consecration, and most were selected by the emperor from his Greek-speaking subjects, [69] resulting in a ""melting pot"" of Western and Eastern Christian traditions in art as well as liturgy. [70]
Most of the Germanic tribes who in the following centuries invaded the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity in its Arian form, which the Council of Nicaea declared heretical . [71] The resulting religious discord between Germanic rulers and Catholic subjects [72] was avoided when, in 497, Clovis I , the Frankish ruler, converted to orthodox Catholicism, allying himself with the papacy and the monasteries. [73] The Visigoths in Spain followed his lead in 589, [74] and the Lombards in Italy in the course of the 7th century. [75]
Western Christianity , particularly through its monasteries , was a major factor in preserving classical civilization , with its art (see Illuminated manuscript ) and literacy. [76] Through his Rule , Benedict of Nursia (c. 480–543), one of the founders of Western monasticism , exerted an enormous influence on European culture through the appropriation of the monastic spiritual heritage of the early Catholic Church and, with the spread of the Benedictine tradition, through the preservation and transmission of ancient culture. During this period, monastic Ireland became a centre of learning and early Irish missionaries such as Columbanus and Columba spread Christianity and established monasteries across continental Europe. [76]
Middle Ages and Renaissance

An interior view of the Sainte-Chapelle on the Île de la Cité in Paris , France, completed in 1248. During the Middle Ages, many buildings in the Gothic architecture -style were erected as places of worship for the Catholic Church.
The Catholic Church was the dominant influence on Western civilization from Late Antiquity to the dawn of the modern age. [13] It was the primary sponsor of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque styles in art, architecture and music. [77] Renaissance figures such as Raphael , Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci , Botticelli , Fra Angelico , Tintoretto , Titian , Bernini and Caravaggio are examples of the numerous visual artists sponsored by the church. [78] Historian Paul Legutko of Stanford University said the Catholic Church is ""at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call Western civilization "". [79]
In Western Christendom , the first universities in Europe were established by monks. [80] [81] [82] Beginning in the 11th century, several older cathedral schools became universities, such as the University of Oxford , University of Paris , and University of Bologna . Higher education before then had been the domain of Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools, led by monks and nuns . Evidence of such schools dates back to the 6th century CE. [83] These new universities expanded the curriculum to include academic programs for clerics, lawyers, civil servants, and physicians. [84] The university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the Medieval Christian setting. [85] [86] [87]
The massive Islamic invasions of the mid-7th century began a long struggle between Christianity and Islam throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The Byzantine Empire soon lost the lands of the eastern patriarchates of Jerusalem , Alexandria and Antioch and was reduced to that of Constantinople, the empire's capital. As a result of Islamic domination of the Mediterranean , the Frankish state, centred away from that sea, was able to evolve as the dominant power that shaped the Western Europe of the Middle Ages. [88] The battles of Toulouse and Poitiers halted the Islamic advance in the West and the failed siege of Constantinople halted it in the East. Two or three decades later, in 751, the Byzantine Empire lost to the Lombards the city of Ravenna from which it governed the small fragments of Italy, including Rome, that acknowledged its sovereignty. The fall of Ravenna meant that confirmation by a no longer existent exarch was not asked for during the election in 752 of Pope Stephen II and that the papacy was forced to look elsewhere for a civil power to protect it. [89] In 754, at the urgent request of Pope Stephen, the Frankish king Pepin the Short conquered the Lombards. He then gifted the lands of the former exarchate to the pope, thus initiating the Papal States . Rome and the Byzantine East would delve into further conflict during the Photian schism of the 860s, when Photius criticized the Latin west of adding of the filioque clause after being excommunicated by Nicholas I . Though the schism was reconciled, unresolved issues would lead to further division. [90]

In the 11th century, the efforts of Hildebrand of Sovana led to the creation of the College of Cardinals to elect new popes, starting with Pope Alexander II in the papal election of 1061 . When Alexander II died, Hildebrand was elected to succeed him, as Pope Gregory VII . The basic election system of the College of Cardinals which Gregory VII helped establish has continued to function into the 21st century. Pope Gregory VII further initiated the Gregorian Reforms regarding the independence of the clergy from secular authority. This led to the Investiture Controversy between the church and the Holy Roman Emperors , over which had the authority to appoint bishops and popes. [91] [92]
In 1095, Byzantine emperor Alexius I appealed to Pope Urban II for help against renewed Muslim invasions in the Byzantine–Seljuk Wars , [93] which caused Urban to launch the First Crusade aimed at aiding the Byzantine Empire and returning the Holy Land to Christian control. [94] In the 11th century , strained relations between the primarily Greek church and the Latin Church separated them in the East–West Schism, partially due to conflicts over papal authority. The Fourth Crusade and the sacking of Constantinople by renegade crusaders proved the final breach. [95] In this age great gothic cathedrals in France were an expression of popular pride in the Christian faith.
In the early 13th century mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzmán . The studia conventualia and studia generalia of the mendicant orders played a large role in the transformation of church-sponsored cathedral schools and palace schools, such as that of Charlemagne at Aachen , into the prominent universities of Europe. [96] Scholastic theologians and philosophers such as the Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas studied and taught at these studia. Aquinas' Summa Theologica was an intellectual milestone in its synthesis of the legacy of ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation. [97]
A growing sense of church-state conflicts marked the 14th century. To escape instability in Rome, Clement V in 1309 became the first of seven popes to reside in the fortified city of Avignon in southern France [98] during a period known as the Avignon Papacy . The Avignon Papacy ended in 1376 when the pope returned to Rome, [99] but was followed in 1378 by the 38-year-long Western schism , with claimants to the papacy in Rome, Avignon and (after 1409) Pisa. [99] The matter was largely resolved in 1415–17 at the Council of Constance , with the claimants in Rome and Pisa agreeing to resign and the third claimant excommunicated by the cardinals, who held a new election naming Martin V pope. [100]
In 1438, the Council of Florence convened, which featured a strong dialogue focussed on understanding the theological differences between the East and West, with the hope of reuniting the Catholic and Orthodox churches. [101] Several eastern churches reunited, forming the majority of the Eastern Catholic Churches . [102]
Age of Discovery and Counter-Reformation
Main articles: Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery and Counter-Reformation
With the rise of Protestantism, the Catholic Church lost some adherents in Europe. Counter-Reformation groups such as the Jesuits were founded to tackle this. At the same time, Catholicism spread in the Americas through evangelisation, represented by the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe .
The Age of Discovery beginning in the 15th century saw the expansion of Western Europe's political and cultural influence worldwide. Because of the rise in power overseas of  strongly Catholic nations of Spain and Portugal (as well as France), Catholicism was spread to the Americas, Asia and Oceania by explorers, conquistadors, and missionaries, as well as by the conversion of people who lived in these societies to the Catholic faith. Pope Alexander VI had awarded sovereignty rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal (later confirmed by the Treaty of Tordesillas ) [103] and the ensuing patronato system allowed state authorities, not the Vatican, to control all clerical appointments in the new colonies. [104] In 1521 the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan made the first Catholic converts in the Philippines . [105] Elsewhere, Portuguese missionaries under the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized in India, China, and Japan. [106] The French colonization of the Americas beginning in the 16th century established a Catholic Francophone population and forbade non-Catholics to settle in Quebec . [107]
In 1415, Jan Hus was burned at the stake for heresy, but his reform efforts encouraged Martin Luther , an Augustinian friar in modern-day Germany, who sent his Ninety-five Theses to several bishops in 1517. [108] His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences , and along with the Leipzig Debate this led to his excommunication in 1521. [108] [109] In Switzerland , Huldrych Zwingli , John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticized Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the Reformation, which gave birth to the great majority of Protestant denominations [110] and also crypto-Protestantism within the Catholic Church. [111] Meanwhile, Henry VIII petitioned Pope Clement VII for a declaration of nullity concerning his marriage to Catherine of Aragon . When this was denied, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed to make himself Supreme Head of the Church of England , spurring the English Reformation and the eventual development of Anglicanism . [112]
The Reformation contributed to clashes between the Protestant Schmalkaldic League and the Catholic Emperor Charles V and his allies. The first nine-year war ended in 1555 with the Peace of Augsburg but continued tensions produced a far graver conflict—the Thirty Years' War —which broke out in 1618. [113] In France, a series of conflicts termed the French Wars of Religion was fought from 1562 to 1598 between the Huguenots (French Calvinists ) and the forces of the French Catholic League , which were backed and funded by a series of popes. [114] This ended under Pope Clement VIII , who hesitantly accepted King Henry IV's 1598 Edict of Nantes granting civil and religious toleration to French Protestants. [113] [114]
The Council of Trent (1545–1563) became the driving force behind the Counter-Reformation in response to the Protestant movement. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as transubstantiation and the requirement for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation. [115] In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world, in part through missionaries and imperialism , although its hold on European populations declined due to the growth of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment. [116]
Enlightenment and modern period

From the 17th century onward, the Enlightenment questioned the power and influence of the Catholic Church over Western society. [117] In the 18th century, writers such as Voltaire and the Encyclopédistes wrote biting critiques of both religion and the Catholic Church. One target of their criticism was the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes by King Louis XIV of France , which ended a century-long policy of religious toleration of Protestant Huguenots. As the papacy resisted pushes for Gallicanism , the French Revolution of 1789 shifted power to the state, caused the destruction of churches, the establishment of a Cult of Reason , [118] and the martyrdom of nuns during the Reign of Terror . [119] In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte 's General Louis-Alexandre Berthier invaded the Italian Peninsula , imprisoning Pope Pius VI , who died in captivity. Napoleon later re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801 . [120] The end of the Napoleonic Wars brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States . [121]
In 1854, Pope Pius IX , with the support of the overwhelming majority of Catholic bishops, whom he had consulted from 1851 to 1853, proclaimed the Immaculate Conception as a dogma in the Catholic Church . [122] In 1870, the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility when exercised in specifically defined pronouncements, [123] [124] striking a blow to the rival position of conciliarism . Controversy over this and other issues resulted in a breakaway movement called the Old Catholic Church , [125]
The Italian unification of the 1860s incorporated the Papal States, including Rome itself from 1870, into the Kingdom of Italy , thus ending the papacy's temporal power . In response, Pope Pius IX excommunicated King Victor Emmanuel II , refused payment for the land, and rejected the Italian Law of Guarantees , which granted him special privileges. To avoid placing himself in visible subjection to the Italian authorities, he remained a "" prisoner in the Vatican "". [126] This stand-off, which was spoken of as the Roman Question , was resolved by the 1929 Lateran Treaties , whereby the Holy See acknowledged Italian sovereignty over the former Papal States in return for payment and Italy's recognition of papal sovereignty over Vatican City as a new sovereign and independent state. [127]
Catholic missionaries generally supported, and sought to facilitate, the European imperial powers' conquest of Africa during the late nineteenth century. According to the historian of religion Adrian Hastings , Catholic missionaries were generally unwilling to defend African rights or encourage Africans to see themselves as equals to Europeans, in contrast to Protestant missionaries, who were more willing to oppose colonial injustices. [128]
20th century

Pope John Paul II and then U.S. president Ronald Reagan (pictured with his wife Nancy ) meeting in June 1982; both Pope John Paul II and Reagan were credited with contributing to the Revolutions of 1989 , which led to the fall of communism and the end of the Cold War two years later, in 1991.
During the 20th century, the church's global reach continued to grow, despite the rise of anti-Catholic authoritarian regimes and the collapse of European Empires, accompanied by a general decline in religious observance in the West. Under Popes Benedict XV , and Pius XII , the Holy See sought to maintain public neutrality through the World Wars, acting as peace broker and delivering aid to the victims of the conflicts. In the 1960s, Pope John XXIII convened the Second Vatican Council , which ushered in radical change to church ritual and practice, and in the later 20th century, the long reign of Pope John Paul II contributed to the fall of communism in Europe, and a new public and international role for the papacy. [129] [130] From the late 20th century, the Catholic Church has been criticized for its doctrines on sexuality , its inability to ordain women , and its handling of sexual abuse cases .
Pope Pius X (1903–1914) renewed the independence of papal office by abolishing the veto of Catholic powers in papal elections, and his successors Benedict XV (1914–1922) and Pius XI (1922–1939) concluded the modern independence of the Vatican State within Italy. [131] Benedict XV was elected at the outbreak of the First World War . He attempted to mediate between the powers and established a Vatican relief office, to assist victims of the war and reunite families. [132] The interwar Pope Pius XI modernized the papacy, appointing 40 indigenous bishops and concluding fifteen concordats, including the Lateran Treaty with Italy which founded the Vatican City State . [133]
His successor Pope Pius XII led the Catholic Church through the Second World War and early Cold War . Like his predecessors, Pius XII sought to publicly maintain Vatican neutrality in the War and established aid networks to help victims, but he secretly assisted the anti-Hitler resistance and shared intelligence with the Allies. [132] His first encyclical Summi Pontificatus (1939) expressed dismay at the 1939 Invasion of Poland and reiterated Catholic teaching against racism. [134] He expressed concern against race killings on Vatican Radio , and intervened diplomatically to attempt to block Nazi deportations of Jews in various countries from 1942 to 1944. However, the Pope's insistence on public neutrality and diplomatic language has become a source of much criticism and debate. [135] Nevertheless, in every country under German occupation, priests played a major part in rescuing Jews. [136] Israeli historian Pinchas Lapide estimated that Catholic rescue of Jews amounted to somewhere between 700,000 and 860,000 people. [137]
The Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church was at its most intense in Poland , and Catholic resistance to Nazism took various forms. Some 2,579 Catholic clergy were sent to the Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp , including 400 Germans. [138] [139] Thousands of priests, nuns and brothers were imprisoned, taken to a concentration camp, tortured and murdered, including Saints Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein . [140] [141] Catholics fought on both sides in the conflict. Catholic clergy played a leading role in the government of the fascist Slovak State , which collaborated with the Nazis, copied their anti-Semitic policies, and helped them carry out the Holocaust in Slovakia. Jozef Tiso , the President of the Slovak State and a Catholic priest, supported his government's deportation of Slovakian Jews to extermination camps. [142] The Vatican protested against these Jewish deportations in Slovakia and in other Nazi puppet regimes including Vichy France , Croatia, Bulgaria , Italy and Hungary. [143] [144]
Around 1943, Adolf Hitler planned the kidnapping of the Pope and his internment in Germany. He gave SS General Wolff a corresponding order to prepare for the action. [145] [146] While Pope Pius XII has been credited with helping to save hundreds of thousands of Jews during the Holocaust , [147] [148] the church has also been accused of having encouraged centuries of antisemitism by its teachings [149] and not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities. [150] Many Nazi criminals escaped overseas after the Second World War, also because they had powerful supporters from the Vatican. [151] [152] [153] The judgment of Pius XII is made more difficult by the sources, because the church archives for his tenure as nuncio, cardinal secretary of state and pope are in part closed or not yet processed. [154]
The Second Vatican Council (1962–65) introduced the most significant changes to Catholic practices since the Council of Trent, four centuries before. [155] Initiated by Pope John XXIII, this ecumenical council modernized the practices of the Catholic Church, allowing the Mass to be said in the vernacular (local language) and encouraging ""fully conscious, and active participation in liturgical celebrations"". [156] It intended to engage the church more closely with the present world ( aggiornamento ), which was described by its advocates as an ""opening of the windows"". [157] In addition to changes in the liturgy, it led to changes to the church's approach to ecumenism , [158] and a call to improved relations with non-Christian religions, especially Judaism, in its document Nostra aetate . [159]
The council, however, generated significant controversy in implementing its reforms: proponents of the "" Spirit of Vatican II "" such as Swiss theologian Hans Küng said that Vatican II had ""not gone far enough"" to change church policies. [160] Traditionalist Catholics , such as Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre , however, strongly criticized the council, arguing that its liturgical reforms led ""to the destruction of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the sacraments"", among other issues. [161] The teaching on the morality of contraception also came under scrutiny; after a series of disagreements, Humanae vitae upheld the church's prohibition of all forms of contraception. [162] [163] [note 5] [164]
In 1978, Pope John Paul II , formerly Archbishop of Kraków in the Polish People's Republic , became the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. His 26 1/2-year pontificate was one of the longest in history and was credited with hastening the fall of communism in Europe. [165] [166] John Paul II sought to evangelize an increasingly secular world . He travelled more than any other pope, visiting 129 countries, [167] and used television and radio as means of spreading the church's teachings. He also emphasized the dignity of work and natural rights of labourers to have fair wages and safe conditions in Laborem exercens . [168] He emphasized several church teachings, including moral exhortations against abortion, euthanasia , and against widespread use of the death penalty, in Evangelium Vitae . [169]
21st century
Pope Benedict XVI , elected in 2005, was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularization , [170] and for increasing use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962, which he titled the ""Extraordinary Form"". [171] Citing the frailties of advanced age, Benedict resigned in 2013, becoming the first pope to do so in nearly 600 years. [172]
Pope Francis, the current pope of the Catholic Church, became in 2013 the first pope from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere , and the first Pope from outside Europe since the eighth-century Gregory III . [173] [174] Francis has made efforts to further close Catholicism's estrangement with the Eastern churches. [175] His installation was attended by Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople of the Eastern Orthodox Church, [176] the first time since the Great Schism of 1054 that the Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has attended a papal installation, [177] while he also met Patriarch Kirill of Moscow , head of the largest Eastern Orthodox church, in 2016; this was reported as the first such high-level meeting between the two churches since the Great Schism of 1054. [178] In 2017 during a visit in Egypt , Pope Francis reestablished mutual recognition of baptism with the Coptic Orthodox Church . [179]
Organization
Main articles: Hierarchy of the Catholic Church and Catholic Church by country
The crossed keys of the Holy See symbolize those of Simon Peter ; the triple crown papal tiara symbolizes the triple power of the pope as ""father of kings"", ""governor of the world"" and "" Vicar of Christ ""; the gold cross symbolizes the sovereignty of Jesus.
The Catholic Church follows an episcopal polity , led by bishops who have received the sacrament of Holy Orders who are given formal jurisdictions of governance within the church. [180] [181] There are three levels of clergy: the episcopate, composed of bishops who hold jurisdiction over a geographic area called a diocese or eparchy ; the presbyterate, composed of priests ordained by bishops and who work in local dioceses or religious orders; and the diaconate, composed of deacons who assist bishops and priests in a variety of ministerial roles. Ultimately leading the entire Catholic Church is the bishop of Rome , known as the pope ( Latin : papa,
lit.
'father'), whose jurisdiction is called the Holy See (Sancta Sedes in Latin). [182] In parallel to the diocesan structure are a variety of religious institutes that function autonomously, often subject only to the authority of the pope, though sometimes subject to the local bishop. Most religious institutes only have male or female members but some have both. Additionally, lay members aid many liturgical functions during worship services. The Catholic Church has been described as the oldest multinational organization in the world. [183] [184] [185]
Holy See, papacy, Roman Curia, and College of Cardinals
Further information: List of popes
Pope Francis , the 266th and current pope of the Catholic Church, a title he holds ex officio as bishop of Rome and sovereign of Vatican City, was elected in the 2013 papal conclave .
The hierarchy of the Catholic Church is headed [note 6] by the pope, currently Pope Francis , who was elected on 13 March 2013 by a papal conclave . [191] The office of the pope is known as the papacy. The Catholic Church holds that Christ instituted the papacy upon giving the keys of Heaven to Saint Peter . His ecclesiastical jurisdiction is called the Holy See, or the Apostolic See (meaning the see of the apostle Peter). [192] [193] Directly serving the pope is the Roman Curia, the central governing body that administers the day-to-day business of the Catholic Church.
The pope is also sovereign of Vatican City, [194] a small city-state entirely enclaved within the city of Rome, which is an entity distinct from the Holy See. It is as head of the Holy See, not as head of Vatican City State, that the pope receives ambassadors of states and sends them his own diplomatic representatives. [195] The Holy See also confers orders, decorations and medals , such as the orders of chivalry originating from the Middle Ages .
While the famous Saint Peter's Basilica is located in Vatican City, above the traditional site of Saint Peter's tomb , the papal cathedral for the Diocese of Rome is the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran , located within the city of Rome, though enjoying extraterritorial privileges accredited to the Holy See.
The position of cardinal is a rank of honour bestowed by popes on certain clerics, such as leaders within the Roman Curia, bishops serving in major cities and distinguished theologians. For advice and assistance in governing, the pope may turn to the College of Cardinals . [196]
Following the death or resignation of a pope, [note 7] members of the College of Cardinals who are under age 80 act as an electoral college , meeting in a papal conclave to elect a successor. [198] Although the conclave may elect any male Catholic as pope, since 1389 only cardinals have been elected. [199]
Canon law
See also: Catholic Church § Liturgy
Catholic canon law ( Latin : jus canonicum) [200] is the system of laws and legal principles made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities of the Catholic Church to regulate its external organization and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics toward the mission of the church. [201] The canon law of the Latin Church was the first modern Western legal system , [202] and is the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West, [203] [204] while the distinctive traditions of Eastern Catholic canon law govern the 23 Eastern Catholic particular churches sui iuris .
Positive ecclesiastical laws, based directly or indirectly upon immutable divine law or natural law , derive formal authority in the case of universal laws from promulgation by the supreme legislator—the Supreme Pontiff —who possesses the totality of legislative, executive and judicial power in his person, [205] while particular laws derive formal authority from promulgation by a legislator inferior to the supreme legislator, whether an ordinary or a delegated legislator. The actual subject material of the canons is not just doctrinal or moral in nature, but all-encompassing of the human condition. It has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system: [206] laws, courts , lawyers, judges, [206] a fully articulated legal code for the Latin Church [207] as well as a code for the Eastern Catholic Churches, [207] principles of legal interpretation , [208] and coercive penalties. [209] [210]
Canon law concerns the Catholic Church's life and organization and is distinct from civil law. In its own field it gives force to civil law only by specific enactment in matters such as the guardianship of minors. [211] Similarly, civil law may give force in its field to canon law, but only by specific enactment, as with regard to canonical marriages. [212] Currently, the 1983 Code of Canon Law is in effect for the Latin Church. [213] The distinct 1990 Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO, after the Latin initials) applies to the autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches. [214]

Municipal corporation
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Legal term for a local governing body
Municipal corporation is the legal term for a local governing body , including (but not necessarily limited to) cities , counties , towns , townships , charter townships , villages , and boroughs . [1] The term can also be used to describe municipally owned corporations . [1] [2] [3]
Municipal corporation as local self-government
[ edit ]
Municipal incorporation occurs when such municipalities become self-governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a municipal charter . A city charter or town charter or municipal charter is a legal document establishing a municipality, such as a city or town .[ citation needed ]
Bangladesh
Main article: List of municipal corporations in Bangladesh
There are 12 city corporations in Bangladesh . Two of these are in the capital Dhaka . Eight other divisional cities have a presence, three others.[ clarification needed ] They perform various socio-economic and civic functions. Besides, there are 330 municipal corporations in eight divisions of Bangladesh. A city corporation is a stronger body than a municipal corporation. This is because a city corporation consists of a metropolitan city of a district , and a municipal corporation consists of a municipal area of a sub-district . [4] [5]
Canada
In Canada, charters are granted by provincial authorities .
India
The Greater Chennai Corporation is the oldest municipal corporation in the world outside the United Kingdom. [6]
Ireland
[ edit ]
The title ""corporation"" was used in boroughs from soon after the Norman conquest until the Local Government Act 2001 . Under the 2001 act, county boroughs were renamed ""cities"" and their corporations became ""city councils""; other borough corporations were renamed ""borough councils"". [7]
After the Partition of Ireland , the corporations in the Irish Free State were Dublin, Cork , Limerick and Waterford (county boroughs) and Drogheda , Kilkenny , Sligo , Clonmel , and Wexford (non-county boroughs). Dún Laoghaire gained borough status in 1930 as ""The Corporation of Dun Laoghaire"". [8] Galway 's borough status, lost in 1840, was restored in 1937; it was formally styled ""the Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the Borough of Galway"", [9] but referred to as ""the Corporation"". [10]
New Zealand
The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 allowed municipal corporations to be established within the new provinces of New Zealand . The term fell out of favour following the abolition of the provinces in 1876. [11]
United Kingdom
The corporations of the burghs of Scotland were similar in origin and were reformed or replaced in the nineteenth century before being abolished by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 . The Irish borough corporations within what is now Northern Ireland were reformed by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 and Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 and replaced by the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 .
United States
Main article: Local government in the United States
Most U.S. states and territories have at least two tiers of local government: counties and municipalities . Louisiana uses the term parish and Alaska uses the term borough for what the U.S. Census Bureau terms county equivalents in those states. Civil townships or towns are used as subdivisions of a county in 20 states, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest.
Population centers may be organized into incorporated municipalities of several types, including the city , town , borough , and village . The types and nature of these municipal entities vary from state to state. In addition to these general-purpose local governments, states may also create special-purpose local governments. Depending on the state, local governments may operate under their own charters or under general law, or a state may have a mix of chartered and general-law local governments. Generally, in a state having both chartered and general-law local governments, the chartered local governments have more local autonomy and home rule. Municipalities are typically subordinate to a county government, with some exceptions. Certain cities, for example, have consolidated with their county government as consolidated city-counties . In Virginia , cities are completely independent from the county in which they would otherwise be a part. In some states, particularly in New England, towns form the primary unit of local government below the state level, in some cases eliminating the need for county government entirely. Many rural areas and even some suburban areas of many states have no municipal government below the county level.
In addition to counties and municipalities, states often create special purpose authorities, such as school districts and districts for fire protection, sanitary sewer service, public transportation , public libraries , public parks or forests, water resource management, and conservation districts . Such special purpose districts may encompass areas in multiple municipalities or counties. According to the US Census Bureau's data collected in 2012, there were 89,004 local government units in the United States. This data shows a decline from 89,476 units since the last census of local governments performed in 2007.
Each of the five permanently inhabited U.S. territories is also subdivided into smaller entities. Puerto Rico has 78 municipalities , and the Northern Mariana Islands has four municipalities. Guam has villages , the U.S. Virgin Islands has districts , and American Samoa has districts and unorganized atolls .
Each Indian Reservation is subdivided in various ways. For example, the Navajo Nation is subdivided into agencies and chapter houses , while the Blackfeet Nation is subdivided into communities .
Municipal corporations as enterprises
[ edit ]
According to one definition of the term, municipal corporations are ""organisations with independent corporate status, managed by an executive board appointed primarily by local government officials, and with majority public ownership"". [1] Some such corporations rely on revenue from user fees, distinguishing them from agencies and special districts funded through taxation, [2] although this is not always the case. [1] Such municipal corporations result from a process of ""externalization"", and require different skills and orientations from the respective local governments, and follow common changes[ clarification needed ] in the institutional landscape of public services. [3] They are argued to be more efficient than government bureaucracies, but have higher failure rates because of their legal and managerial autonomy. [1]

Structure
The Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (abbreviated: GWMC [1] ) is the civic body of Warangal . [2] Its geographical area covers most of that administered by the Kakatiya Urban Development Authority . [3]
History
[ edit ]
Warangal Municipality being one of the oldest in the state was a major municipality in 1844 Fasli . In July 1959 it was upgraded as a special grade municipality, in July 1960 into a selection grade, and then on 18 August 1994 it was declared as municipal corporation . [4] On 28 January 2015, it is upgraded to Greater municipal corporation by Government of Telangana . [5] [6]
Smart city
[ edit ]
The citizens of Warangal can hope for better facilities as the Central government shortlisted it under the Smart Cities Mission . [7] The program enables the city to secure funds from the central government in strengthening and extension of existing services and its infrastructure.
Clean Cities Championship
[ edit ]
In 2012, the city of Warangal was generating 300 tonnes per day (TPD) of municipal solid waste (MSW) of which about 60% was being collected by the GWMC. The residual MSW was piling up across the city, making it look untidy and creating an unsanitary environment. In these conditions, the GWMC devised an innovative solution to addressing MSW management – the Clean Cities Championship. Taking place over one week in mid October 2012, the GWMC invited waste management professionals from 57 municipalities across the state of Telangana to compete in the Clean Cities Championship. [8]
Leading up to the event, a multi-channel information and education campaign (IEC) created awareness and excitement about the event via billboards, posters, pamphlets, radio jingles, TV ads, street plays, a web portal and TV shows. [9]
All the Clean Cities Championship participants were divided into 386 teams, with each team being given the responsibility of waste collection from 500 households per day. The teams went door-to-door and demonstrated correct waste segregation techniques to the householders and gave them two bins, one each for wet and dry waste. Each team spent about fours hours per day collecting MSW from households on its route. [10] The waste was then taken to central drop-off points where it was weighed and further segregated as required. The segregated waste was then taken to waste recovery facilities, which had been prepped ahead of time, here the organic waste underwent bio-methanation or composting , the recyclable waste was sorted and recycled and the inert waste was sent to Marikonda dumpsite 15 kilometers outside the city. [8] [9]
National Cadet Corps (NCC) cadets were the monitors of the competition and marked the waste collection teams on attributes such as gloves worn, masks worn, etc. Each day one man and one woman from across all the teams won a prize. At the end of the week, the best team ( Khammam Municipal Corporation ) won the Clean Cities Championship trophy. [8]
Following the Clean Cities Championship, Warangal became the first city in India to achieve 100% door-to-door MSW collection. About 70% of households started practicing two-bin MSW segregation into wet and dry waste. 420 cement bins and 128 dumpsters were removed from locations across Warangal making it a no dump city. [9]
GWMC was able to reduce the MSW going to landfill by 30% to 40% [11] and the dumpyard with significantly reduced load is, in phases, being converted into a nature park with vermicomposting sheds. [9]

Location of World Heritage Sites in India:
Green dots indicate the seven clusters in the Western Ghats
Pink dots indicate the Mountain Railways of India
Turquoise dots indicate cities with multiple sites. Delhi and Mumbai have three sites each, Agra and Jaipur have two sites each.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designates World Heritage Sites of outstanding universal value to cultural or natural heritage which have been nominated by countries which are signatories to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. [1] Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. [2] India accepted the convention on 14 November 1977, making its sites eligible for inclusion on the list. [3]
There are 43 World Heritage Sites in India. Out of these, 35 are cultural, seven are natural, and one, Khangchendzonga National Park , is of mixed type, listed for both cultural and natural properties. India has the sixth-most sites worldwide. The first sites to be listed were the Ajanta Caves , Ellora Caves , Agra Fort , and Taj Mahal , all of which were inscribed in the 1983 session of the World Heritage Committee . The most recent site listed is the Moidams – the Mound-Burial System of the Ahom Dynasty , in 2024. [3] At different times, two sites were listed as endangered : the Manas Wildlife Sanctuary was listed between 1992 and 2011 due to poaching and the activities of Bodo militias, [4] and the monuments at Hampi were listed between 1999 and 2006 due to risks from increased traffic and new constructions in surroundings. [5] One site is transnational: The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier is shared with six other countries. [6] In addition, India has 56 sites on its tentative list. [3]

The history of cave paintings in India or rock art range from drawings and paintings from prehistoric times, beginning in the caves of Central India, typified by those at the Bhimbetka rock shelters from around 10,000 BP , to elaborate frescoes at sites such as the rock-cut artificial caves at Ajanta and Ellora , extending as late as 6th–10th century CE.

Archaeologists discovered cave paintings and tools in Mangar Bani hill forest in May 2021; the cave paintings are estimated to be 10,000 years old. These are believed to be the largest in the Indian subcontinent and possibly the world's oldest. [1] [2] It is likely the largest paleolithic site in the Indian subcontinent and this is the first time cave paintings have been found in Aravalli . According to the Haryana Archaeology and Museums Department , ""On the basis of this exploration, it can be said that this may be one of the biggest Palaeolithic sites in the Indian sub-continent, where stone age tools were recovered from different open-air sites as well as from rock shelters. Though tools from the Palaeolithic Age have been identified earlier in parts of the Aravallis, it is for the first time that cave paintings and rock art of a large magnitude have been found in Haryana.""[ citation needed ]

Status
India
The Bahmani Kingdom or the Bahmani Sultanate was a late medieval kingdom that ruled the Deccan plateau in India. The first independent Muslim sultanate of the Deccan, [7] the Bahmani Kingdom came to power in 1347 during the rebellion of Ismail Mukh against Muhammad bin Tughlaq , the Sultan of Delhi . Ismail Mukh then abdicated in favour of Zafar Khan , who established the Bahmani Sultanate.
The Bahmani Kingdom was perpetually at war with its neighbours, including its rival to the south, the Vijayanagara Empire , which outlasted the sultanate. [8] . The Mahmud Gawan Madrasa was created by Mahmud Gawan , the vizier regent who was prime minister of the sultanate from 1466 until his execution in 1481 during a conflict between the foreign (Afaqis) and local (Deccanis) nobility. Bidar Fort was built by Ahmad Shah I ( r. 1422–36), who relocated the capital to the city of Bidar . Ahmad Shah led campaigns against Vijayanagar and the sultanates of Malwa and Gujarat . His campaign against Vijayanagar in 1423 included a siege of the capital, ending in the expansion of the Sultanate. Mahmud Gawan would later lead campaigns against Malwa, Vijayanagar, and the Gajapatis , and extended the sultanate to its maximum extent.
The sultanate began to decline under Mahmood Shah . Through a combination of factional strife and the revolt of five provincial governors ( tarafdars ), the Bahmani Sultanate split up into five states, known as the Deccan sultanates . The initial revolts of Yusuf Adil Shah , Malik Ahmad Nizam Shah I , and Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk in 1490 and Qasim Barid I in 1492 saw the end of any real Bahmani power, and the last independent sultanate, Golkonda , in 1518, ended the Bahmanis' 180 year rule over the Deccan . The last four Bahmani rulers were puppet monarchs under Amir Barid I of the Bidar Sultanate , and the kingdom formally dissolved in 1527. [9] [10]
Origin
See also: Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah
The Bahmani Kingdom was founded by Zafar Khan , who was of either Afghan or Turkic origin. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Encyclopedia Iranica states him to be a Khorasani adventurer, who claimed descent from Bahrām Gōr . [16] According to the medieval historian Ferishta , his obscurity makes it difficult to track his origin, but he is nonetheless stated as of Afghan birth. [17] Ferishta further writes, Zafar Khan had earlier been a servant of a Brahmin astrologer at Delhi named Gangu , giving him the name Hasan Gangu, [18] [19] and says that he was from North India. [20] Historians have not found any corroboration for the legend, [21] [22] but Barani , who was the court chronicler of Sultan Firuz Shah , as well as some other scholars have also called him Hasan Gangu. [23] Another theory of origin for Zafar Khan is that he was of Brahmin origin, [24] and that Bahman (his given name following the establishment of the sultanate) is a corrupted personalized form of Brahman, [25] with Hasan Gangu being a Hindu Brahman who became Muslim. [26] [24] However this view has been discredited by S.A.Q. Husaini, who considers the idea of a Brahmin origin or Zafar Khan originally being a Hindu convert to Islam from Punjab untenable. [27]
History
[ edit ]
Ziauddin Barani , the court chronicler of Sultan Firuz Shah , states that Hasan Gangu , the Bahmani Sultanate's founder, was ""born in very humble circumstances"" and that ""For the first thirty years of his life he was nothing more than a field laborer."" [28] He was made a commander of a hundred horsemen by the Delhi Sultan , Muhammad bin Tughluq ,  who was pleased with his honesty. This sudden rise in the military and socio-economic ladder was common in this era of Muslim India. [29] Zafar Khan or Hasan Gangu was among the inhabitants of Delhi who were forced to migrate to the Deccan, to build a large Muslim settlement in the region of Daulatabad . [30] Zafar Khan was a man of ambition and looked forward to the adventure. He had long hoped to employ his body of horsemen in the Deccan as the region was seen as the place of bounty in Muslim imagination at the time. He was rewarded with an Iqta for taking part in the conquest of Kampili . [31]
Rise
class=notpageimage|
The Bahmani Sultanate and main South Asian polities in 1400 CE [32]
Before the establishment of his kingdom, Hasan Gangu (Zafar Khan) was Governor of Deccan and a commander on behalf of the Tughlaqs . On 3 August 1347, during the rebellion by the Amirs of the Deccan , Ismail Mukh, the leader of the rebellion (whom the rebel amirs of the Deccan placed on the throne of Daulatabad in 1345), abdicated in favor of Zafar Khan, resulting in the establishment of the Bahmani Kingdom. The Sultan of Delhi had besieged the rebels at the citadel of Daulatabad. As another rebellion had begun in Gujarat , the Sultan left and installed Shaikh Burhan-ud-din Bilgrami and Malik Jauhar and other nobles in charge of the siege. Meanwhile, as these nobles were unable to stop the Deccani amirs from pursuing the imperial army, Hasan Gangu, a native of Delhi, then being pursued by Governor of Berar Imad-ul-Mulk, the leader to whom the Deccani Amirs had re-assembled against, attacked and slew the latter and marched on towards Daulatabad. Here Hasan Gangu and the Deccani amirs put to flight the imperial forces which had been left to besiege. The rebels at Daulatabad had the sense to see Hasan Gangu as the man of the hour, and the proposal to crown Hasan Gangu, entitled Zafar Khan, was accepted without a dissentient voice on 3 August 1347. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] His revolt was successful, and he established an independent state on the Deccan within the Delhi Sultanate's southern provinces with its headquarters at Hasanabad ( Gulbarga ), where all his coins were minted. [33] [38]
With the support of the influential Indian Chishti Sufi Shaikhs , he was crowned ""Alauddin Bahman Shah Sultan – Founder of the Bahmani Dynasty"". [39] They bestowed upon him a robe allegedly worn by the prophet Muhammad . The extension of the Sufi's notion of spiritual sovereignty lent legitimacy to the planting of the sultanate's political authority, where the land, people, and produce of the Deccan were merited state protection, no longer available for plunder with impunity. These Sufis legitimized the transplantation of Indo-Muslim rulership from one region in South Asia to another, converting the land of the Bahmanids into being recognized as Dar ul-Islam , while it was previously considered Dar ul-Harb . [40]
Turkish or Indo-Turkish troops, explorers, saints, and scholars moved from Delhi and North India to the Deccan with the establishment of the Bahmanid sultanate. How many of these were Shi'ites is unclear. Nonetheless, there is enough evidence to demonstrate that a number of nobility at the Bahmani court identified as Shi'ites or had significant Shi'ite inclinations. [a] [4]
Succeeding rulers (1358–1422)
[ edit ]
Alauddin was succeeded by his son Mohammed Shah I . [42] His conflicts with the Vijayanagar empire were singularly savage wars, as according to the historian Ferishta , ""the population of the Carnatic was so reduced that it did not recover for several ages."" [43] The Bahmanids' aggressive confrontation with the two main Hindu kingdoms of the southern Deccan, Warangal and Vijayanagara in the First Bahmani–Vijayanagar War , made them renowned among Muslims as warriors of the faith. [44]
The Vijayanagara empire and the Bahmanids fought over the control of the Godavari-basin, Tungabadhra Doab, and the Marathwada country, although they seldom required a pretext for declaring war, [45] as military conflicts were almost a regular feature and lasted as long as these kingdoms continued. [46] Military slavery involved captured slaves from Vijayanagara whom were then converted to Islam and integrated into the host society, so they could begin military careers within the Bahmanid empire. [47] [48]
Ghiyasuddin succeeded his father Muhammad II at the age of seventeen in April 1397, but was blinded and imprisoned by a Turkic slave called Taghalchin, [49] [50] who had held a grudge on the Sultan for the latter's refusal to appoint him as a governor. He had lured the Sultan into putting himself in the former's power, using the beauty of his daughter, who was accomplished in music and arts, and had introduced her to the Sultan at a feast. [51] [52] He was succeeded by Shamsuddin, who was a puppet king under Taghalchin. Firuz and Ahmed , the sons of the fourth sultan Daud , marched to Gulbarga to avenge Ghiyasuddin. Firuz declared himself the sultan, and defeated Taghalchin's forces. Taghalchin was killed and Shamsuddin was blinded. [53]
Taj ud-Din Firuz Shah became the sultan in November 1397. [54] Firuz Shah fought against the Vijayanagara Empire on many occasions and the rivalry between the two dynasties continued unabated throughout his reign, with victories in 1398 and in 1406 , but a defeat in 1417. One of his victories resulted in his marriage to the daughter of Deva Raya , the Vijayanagara Emperor. [55]
Firuz Shah expanded the nobility by enabling Hindus and granting them high office. [56] In his reign, Sufis such as Gesudaraz , a Chishti saint who had immigrated from Dehli to Daulatabad, were prominent in court and daily life. [57] He was the first author to write in the Dakhni dialect of Urdu . [58] The Dakhni language became widespread, practised by various milieus from the court to the Sufis. It was established as a lingua franca of the Muslims of the Deccan, as not only the aspect of a dominant urban elite, but an expression of the regional religious identity. [59]
Later rulers (1422–1482)
[ edit ]
Firuz Shah was succeeded by his younger brother Ahmad Shah I Wali . Following the establishment of Bidar as capital of the sultanate in 1429, [60] Ahmad Shah I converted to Shi'ism . [4] Ahmad Shah's reign was marked by relentless military campaigns and expansionism. He imposed destruction and slaughter on Vijayanagara and finally captured the remnants of Warangal. [61]
Chand Minar at Daulatabad fort complex
Alauddin Ahmad II succeeded his father to the throne in 1436. [62] The Chand Minar , a minaret in Daulatabad , was constructed under his reign, and was commemorated in his honour [63] in 1445 [64] for his victory against Deva Raya II of Vijayanagara in 1443, [63] the last major conflcit between the two powers. [65] For the first half-century after the establishment of the Bahmanids, the original North Indian colonists and their sons had administered the empire quite independent of either the non-Muslim Hindus, or the Muslim foreign immigrants. However, the later Bahmani Sultans, mainly starting from his father Ahmad Shah Wali I, began to recruit foreigners from overseas, whether because of depletion among the ranks of the original settlers, or the feelings of dependency upon the Persian courtly model, or both. [66] This resulted in factional strife that first became acute in the reign of his son Alauddin Ahmad Shah II. [67] In 1446, the powerful Dakhani nobles persuaded the Sultan that the Persians were responsible for the failure of the earlier invasion of the Konkan . [68]
The Sultan, drunk, condoned a large-scale massacre of Persian Shi'a Sayyids by the Sunni Dakhani nobles and their Sunni Abyssinian slaves. [69] A few survivors escaped the massacre dressed in women's clothing and convinced the Sultan of their innocence. [70] Ashamed of his own folly, the Sultan punished the Dakhani leaders who were responsible for the massacre, putting  them to death or throwing them in prison, and reduced their families to beggary. [71] The accounts of the violent events likely included exaggerations as it came from the pen of the chroniclers who were themselves mainly foreigners and products of Safavid Persia . [72]
Mahmud Gawan Madrasa , built by Mahmud Gawan to be the centre of religious as well as secular education [73]
The eldest sons of Humayun Shah, Nizam-Ud-Din Ahmad III and Muhammad Shah III Lashkari ascended the throne successively, while they were young boys. The vizier Mahmud Gawan ruled as regent during this period, until Muhammad Shah reached age. Mahmud Gawan is known for setting up the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa , a center of religious as well as secular education, [73] as well as achieving the sultanate's greatest extent during his rule. [2] He also increased the administrative divisions of the sultanate from four to eight to ease the administrative burden from previous expansion of the state. Gawan was considered a great statesman, and a poet of repute. [74]
Mahmud Gawan was caught in a struggle between a rivalry between two groups of nobles, the Dakhanis and the Afaqis. The Dakhanis made up the indigenous Muslim elite of the Bahmanid dynasty, being descendants of Sunni immigrants from Northern India, while the Afaqis were foreign newcomers from the west such as Gawan, who were mostly Shi'is. [75] [76] The Dakhanis believed that the privileges, patronage and positions of power in the sultanate should have been reserved solely for them. [77]
The divisions included sectarian religious divisions where the Afaqis were looked upon as heretics by the Sunnis as the former were Shi'as. [78] Eaton cites a linguistic divide where the Dakhanis spoke Dakhni while the Afaqis favored the Persian language. [79] Mahmud Gawan had tried to reconcile with the two factions over his fifteen-year prime ministership, but had found it difficult to win their confidence; the party strife could not be stopped. [2] His Afaqis opponents, led by Nizam-ul-Mulk Bahri and motivated by anger over Mahmud's reforms which had curtailed the nobility's power, fabricated a treasonous letter to Purushottama Deva of Orissa which they purported to be from him. [80] [81] Mahmud Gawan was ordered executed by Muhammad Shah III, an act that the latter regretted until his death in 1482. [74] Upon his death, Nizam-ul-Mulk Bahri, the father of the founder of the Nizam Shahi dynasty became the regent of the Sultan as prime minister. [82] [83]
Decline

Muhammad Shah III Lashkari was succeeded by his son Mahmood Shah Bahmani II , the last Bahmani ruler to have real power. [84] The tarafdars of Ahmednagar , Bijapur , and Berar , Malik Ahmad Nizam Shah I , Yusuf Adil Shah , and Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk agreed to assert their independence in 1490, and established their own sultanates but maintained loyalty to the Bahmani Sultan. The sultanates of Golconda and Bidar would become in practice independent as well. [9] In 1501, Mahmood Shah Bahmani united his amirs and wazirs in an agreement to wage annual Jihad against Vijayanagara. The expeditions were financially ruinous. [85]
The last Bahmani Sultans were puppet monarchs under their Barid Shahi prime ministers, who were the de facto rulers. After 1518 the sultanate formally broke up into the five states of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. They are collectively known as the Deccan sultanates . [9]
Historiography
[ edit ]
Modern scholars like Haroon Khan Sherwani and Richard M. Eaton have based their accounts of the Bahmani dynasty mainly upon the medieval chronicles of Firishta and Syed Ali Tabatabai. [86] [87] Other contemporary works were the Sivatattva Chintamani, a Kannada language encyclopedia on the beliefs and rites of the Veerashaiva faith, and Guru Charitra . Afanasy Nikitin , a Russian merchant and traveler, traveled through the Bahmani Sultanate in his journeys. He contrasts the huge ""wealth of the nobility with the wretchedness of the peasantry and the frugality of the Hindus"". [88]
Culture

Taj ud-Din Firuz Shah of the Bahmani Sultanate's Firman
The Bahmani dynasty patronized Indo-Muslim and Persian culture from Northern India and the Middle East. [89] However, the society of the Bahmnanis was dominated prominently by Iranians, Afghans, and Turks. [90] They also had considerable and social influence such as with the celebration of Nowruz by Bahmani rulers. [90] This also comes as Mohammed Shah I ascended the throne on Nowruz. [91] According to Khafi Khan and Ferishta , musicians flocked to the court from Lahore , Delhi , Persia and Khorasan . [92]
The Bahmani Sultans were patrons of the Persian language , culture and literature , and some members of the dynasty became well-versed in the language and composed its literature in the language. [7]
The first sultan, Alauddin Bahman Shah , is noted to have captured 1,000 singing and dancing girls from Hindu temples after he battled the northern Carnatic chieftains. The later Bahmanis also enslaved civilian women and children in wars; many of them were converted to Islam in captivity. [93] [94]
Bidriware

Bidriware is a metal handicraft from the city of Bidar in Karnataka . It was developed in the 14th century during the rule of the Bahmani Sultans. [95] The term ""bidriware"" originates from the township of Bidar, which is still the chief center of production. [96] The craftspersons of Bidar were so famed for their inlay work on copper and silver that it came to be known as Bidri. [95] The metal used is white brass that is blackened and inlaid with silver. [96] As a native art form, Bidriware obtained a geographical Indications (GI) registry on 3 January 2006. [97]

Regions with significant populations
romanized :
Teluguvāru), also called Āndhras, are an ethno-linguistic group who speak the Telugu language and are native to the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh , Telangana and Yanam district of Puducherry . They are the most populous of the four major Dravidian linguistic groups. Telugu is the fourth most spoken language in India [15] and the 14th most spoken native language in the world. [16] A significant number of Telugus also reside in the Indian states of Karnataka , Tamil Nadu , Orissa , Maharashtra . Members of the Telugu diaspora are spread across countries like United States , Australia , Malaysia , Mauritius , UAE and others. [17] Telugu is the fastest-growing language in the United States. [18] It is also a protected language in South Africa . [19]
Andhra is an ethnonym used for Telugu people since antiquity. [20] The earliest mention of the Andhras occurs in Aitareya Brahmana ( c. 800 BCE ) of the Rigveda . [21] In the Mahabharata , the infantry of Satyaki was composed of a tribe called the Andhras, known for their long hair, tall stature, sweet language, and mighty prowess. They were also mentioned in the Buddhist Jataka tales . [22] Megasthenes reported in his Indica ( c. 310 BCE) that the Andhras, living in the Godavari and Krishna river deltas , were famous for their formidable military strength, which was second only to that of the Maurya Empire in the entire Indian subcontinent . [23] The first major Andhra polity was the Satavahana dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) which ruled over the entire Deccan plateau and even distant areas of western and central India. [24] They established trade relations with the Roman Empire , and their capital city near Amaravathi was the most prosperous city in India during the 2nd century CE. [25] Inscriptions in Old Telugu script (Vengi script) were found as far away as Indonesia and Myanmar . [26]
In the 13th century, Kakatiyas unified various Telugu-speaking areas under one realm. [27] Later, Telugu culture and literature flourished and reached its zenith during the late Vijayanagara Empire . [28] [29] After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, various Telugu rulers called Nayakas established independent kingdoms across South India serving the same function as Rajput warriors clans of northern India. [30] Kandyan Nayaks , the last dynasty to rule Sri Lanka were of Telugu descent. [31] In this era, Telugu became the language of high culture throughout South India . [32] Vijaya Ramaswamy compared it to the overwhelming dominance of French as the cultural language of modern Europe during roughly the same era. [33] Telugu also predominates in the evolution of Carnatic music , one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music . [34]
The architecture developed by Andhras in Krishna river valley in early first centuries CE , called the Amaravati School of Art , is regarded as one of the three major styles of ancient Indian art and had a great influence on art in South India , Sri Lanka , and Southeast Asia . [35] Mahayana , the predominant Buddhist tradition in China , Japan , and Korea and the largest Buddhist denomination in the world, was developed among Telugus in Andhra. [36]
Telugu is one of six languages designated as a classical language by the Government of India . It has been in use as an official language for over 1,400 years [37] and has an unbroken and diverse literary tradition of over a thousand years. [38] [39] Telugu performing arts include the classical dance form Kuchipudi , as well as Perini Sivatandavam , and Burra Katha . The Telugu shadow puppetry tradition, Tholu Bommalata , dates back to the 3rd century BCE, [40] and is the ancestor of Wayang , the popular Indonesian art form that has been a staple of Indonesian tourism. [41] Telugu cinema is the largest film industry in India in terms of box office as well as admissions. [42] [43] The industry has produced some of India's most expensive and highest-grossing films , influencing Indian popular culture well beyond Telugu-speaking regions. [44]
Etymology
Telugu
Speakers of Telugu refer to it as simply Telugu or Telugoo. [45] Older forms of the name include Teluṅgu and Tenuṅgu. [46] Tenugu is derived from the Proto-Dravidian word *ten (""south"") [47] to mean ""the people who lived in the south/southern direction"". The name Telugu, then, is a result of an ""n"" to ""l"" alternation established in Telugu. [48] [49]
P. Chenchiah and Bhujanga Rao note that Atharvana Acharya in the 13th century wrote a grammar of Telugu, calling it the Trilinga Shabdānushāsana (or Trilinga Grammar). [50] However, most scholars note that Atharvana's grammar was titled Atharvana Karikavali. [51] [52] [53] [54] Appa Kavi in the 17th century explicitly wrote that Telugu was derived from Trilinga. Scholar Charles P. Brown made a comment that it was a ""strange notion"" since the predecessors of Appa Kavi had no knowledge of such a derivation. [55]
George Abraham Grierson and other linguists doubt this derivation, holding rather that Telugu was the older term and Trilinga must be the later Sanskritisation of it. [56] [57] If so the derivation itself must have been quite ancient because Triglyphum, Trilingum and Modogalingam are attested in ancient Greek sources, the last of which can be interpreted as a Telugu rendition of ""Trilinga"". [58]
Andhra
Main article: Andhras
Andhra is an ethnonym used for Telugu people since antiquity. [20] Andhras were an ancient non-Aryan tribe of south-central Indian subcontinent , whose existence is attested during the Iron Age . As per Iravatham Mahadevan , non-Aryan people living beyond the borders of the region inhabited by the Indo-Aryan speakers were known as the Andhras. [59] Mahadevan notes that since most Dravidian -speaking men had names ending with the suffIx -(a)nṟ, the Dravidian etymon -(a)nṟ was borrowed as a loanword into Indo-Aryan as andha and later as āndhra to denote the name of the neighbouring Dravidian-speaking people. [59]
History

Ancient era
Andhra ( Telugu : ఆంధ్ర) was a kingdom mentioned in the epic Mahabharata . [22] It was a southern kingdom, currently identified as Indian state of Andhra Pradesh where it got its name from. Andhra communities are also mentioned in the Vayu , Skanda , Markandeya and Matsya Purana . In the Mahabharata the infantry of Satyaki was composed by a tribe called Andhras, known for their long hair, tall stature, sweet language, and mighty prowess. They lived along the banks of the Godavari river. Andhras and Kalingas supported the Kauravas during the Mahabharata war. Sahadeva defeated the kingdoms of Pandya, Andhra, Kalinga, Dravida, Odra and Chera while performing the Rajasuya Yajna . Buddhist references to Andhras are also found. [60] [61] [62]
Approximate extent of the Satavahana Empire (Andhra Empire) in the late 1st century CE. [63]
Andhras were mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana of the Rigveda ( c. 500 BCE) as descendants of sage Vishvamitra . [64] They were referred to as dasyus or non-aryans living on the fringes of Aryan settlements. [65] The Eastern Deccan region inhabited by Andhras was called Andhradesa . They were also mentioned in the Mahabharata and Buddhist Jataka tales . [22] In the seventh century BCE, Asmaka was one of the sixteen Mahajanapadas . Andhras were mentioned by Megasthenes in his Indica ( c. 310 BCE) as being second only to Mauryans in military strength in the entire Indian subcontinent . They had 30 fortified towns along the Godavari River and an army of 1,00,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 1,000 elephants. [23] They are mentioned at the time of the death of the great Mauryan King Ashoka in 232 BCE. [66] [67] [68]
The first major Andhra polity was the Satavahana dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) which ruled over the entire Deccan plateau and established trade relations with the Roman Empire . [69] [70] [71] The kingdom reached its zenith under Gautamiputra Satakarni . Their capital city, Amaravati was the most prosperous city in India in 2nd century CE. [25] At the end of the Satavahana rule, the Telugu region was divided into Kingdoms ruled by lords. In the late second century CE, the Andhra Ikshvakus ruled the eastern region along the Krishna River. During the fourth century, the Pallava dynasty extended their rule across southern Andhra Pradesh and Tamilakam and established their capital at Kanchipuram . Their power increased during the reigns of Mahendravarman I (571–630) and Narasimhavarman I (630–668). The Pallavas dominated the southern Telugu-speaking region and northern Tamilakam until the end of the ninth century. Later, various dynasties have ruled the area, including the Salankayanas , Cholas , Vishnukundinas and Eastern Chalukyas . [66]
Medieval era
Map of the Kakatiyas, circa 1150–1300 CE. [72]
Extent of Vijayanagara Empire, around 1520 CE.
Between 1163 and 1323 the Kakatiya dynasty emerged, bringing the distinct upland and lowland cultures of Telugu lands, which brought into being a feeling of cultural affinity between those who spoke the Telugu language . [27] Kakatiya era also saw the development of a distinct style of architecture which improved and innovated upon the existing modes. [73] Most notable examples are the Thousand Pillar Temple in Hanamkonda , Ramappa Temple in Palampet, Warangal Fort , Golconda Fort and Kota Gullu in Ghanpur . [74] During this period, the Telugu language emerged as a literary medium with the writings of Nannaya, Tikkana , Eranna , Pothana etc. are the translators and poets of the great Hindu epics like Ramayana , Mahabharatha , Bhagavatha etc.
Telingana, a term referring to the land inhabited by Telugus, was first used during the 14th century CE. [75] [76] In 1323 the sultan of Delhi , Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq , sent a large army commanded by Ulugh Khan (later, as Muhammad bin Tughluq , the Delhi sultan) to conquer the Telugu region and lay siege to Warangal . The fall of the Kakatiya dynasty led to an era with competing influences from the Turkic kingdoms of Delhi and the Persio-Tajik sultanate of central India. The struggle for Andhra ended with the victory of the Musunuri Nayaks over the Turkic Delhi Sultanate .
The Telugus achieved independence under Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire (1336–1646). The Qutb Shahi dynasty of the Bahmani Sultanate succeeded that empire. The Qutub Shahis were tolerant of Telugu culture from the early 16th to the end of the 17th centuries. [77]
Modern era
The arrival of Europeans (the French under the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau and the English under Robert Clive ) altered polity of the region. In 1765, Clive and the chief and council at Visakhapatnam obtained the Northern Circars from Mughal emperor Shah Alam . The British achieved supremacy when they defeated Maharaja Vijaya Rama Gajapati Raju of Vizianagaram in 1792.
Andhra's modern foundation was laid in the struggle for Indian independence. India became independent from the United Kingdom in 1947. Potti Sreeramulu 's campaign for a state independent of the Madras Presidency and Tanguturi Prakasam Panthulu and Kandukuri Veeresalingam 's social-reform movements led to the formation of Andhra State , with Kurnool as its capital and freedom-fighter Prakasam Pantulu as its first chief minister. Andhra, the first Indian state formed primarily on a linguistic basis, was carved from the Madras Presidency in 1953. Although the Muslim Nizam of Hyderabad wanted to retain independence from India, he was forced to cede his kingdom to the Dominion of India in 1948 to form Hyderabad State . In 1956, Andhra State was merged with the Telugu-speaking portion of Hyderabad State (the Telangana region) to create the state of Andhra Pradesh . The Lok Sabha approved the formation of Telangana from ten northwestern districts of Andhra Pradesh on 18 February 2014. [78]

Fortress in Telangana, India
Native name భువనగిరి కోట ( Telugu )
Bhongir Fort
Bhuvanagiri municipality corporation
Location of Bhuvangiri Fort in Telangana
Bhuvanagiri Fort is a Fort located in the Heart of Bhuvanagiri City of Yadadri Bhuvanagiri District , Telangana , India . [1] [2] It is located on a huge rock at a commanding height. [3] [4] [5] 50 Kms from Hyderabad.
History
[ edit ]
The Bhongir fort adorns the place from the time it was built in 10th century. Bhongir Fort was built on an isolated monolithic rock by the Western Chalukya ruler Tribhuvanamalla Vikramaditya IV in the year 1076  and was thus named after him as Tribhuvanagiri, later it was called as Bhuvanagiri. Some of the inscriptions found in the fort were in Kannada and Telugu language highlighting the lifestyle of the people of that era. The inscriptions, the architecture and some sculptures found in the fort reveal that the fort was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty for a long time and then by the Kakatiya dynasty . The stone wall, the steps through the granite archways and the crumbling stucco ruins of the later age, still adorn the place.[ citation needed ]
Somewhere in 15th century, the fort was ceded to the Bahamani Sultans and then was taken over by a local governor. The Qutb Shahis ' used the fort as a prison for those who aspired to snatch their throne. During the time of the British, the fort escaped their attention and was not occupied. Bhuvanagiri was much ignored after the downfall of the Nizams at the time of communist revolution in the late 1940s.[ citation needed ]
The Fort
[ edit ]
Bhongir sits on a unique egg-shaped rock hill more than 500 feet high. The steps from the bottom of the hill to the top are still intact; at the beginning of the steps there is a Hanuman Temple with two entry points protected by huge rocks, so the fort was considered practically impregnable by invading armies. The splendid historical fort with the awe-inspiring rock and the aesthetically fortified courts which have stood the ravages of time stir the imagination of tourists. A moat that encircles the fort, a vast underground chamber, trap doors, an armoury, stables, ponds, wells, etc., make for fascinating viewing. The view from the top of the surrounding of the neighbouring area. The fort is associated with the rule of the heroic queen Rudramadevi and the countryside is simply breathtaking. The Bala Hisar or citadel on the top of the hill gives a bird's eye view. Rumour has it that there once was an underground corridor connecting Bhongir Fort to Golconda Fort. There is a statue placed at entry of the fort which came out in nearby diggings around fort. It is a popular trekking spot.[ citation needed ]

HYDERABAD: Amid all the euphoria of gaining statehood, the new Telangana government may have got the state emblem wrong. The new Telangana emblem does not have the inscription of âSatyameva Jayateâ (Truth alone triumphs) in Devanagari script below the profile of Emperor Ashokaâs Lion Capital as it should be. Instead, the said inscription figures at the bottom of the emblem far away from the Lion Capital, which experts say is objectionable and needs to be corrected immediately.
âThe newly created Telangana emblem is wrong and a violation under the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act 2005. Violations of this act occur frequently but purely out of ignorance,â said Haryana-based activist Naresh Kadyan, who lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Home Affairs on Tuesday.
The ministry has accepted the complaint and is âactivelyâ reviewing it, he claimed. In fact, a memorandum issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs last year clearly states that the emblem of India is incomplete without the motto: ``Satyameva Jayateââ inscribed below the profile of the Lion Capital. Incomplete display of the emblem is a violation of the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improver Use) Act, 2005, the ministry said in the memorandum, while criticizing the police, paramilitary forces, army and the ordinance factories for wrong display of the emblem.
The Telangana emblem in question has the popular Kakatiya arch standing out in the circular emblem in green colour with an image of Charminar at the centre. The Telangana emblem was designed by Laxman Alley, a popular artist from a village in Atmakur mandal of Nalgonda district. âIf the Act specifies to the point where it should figure then the government has to relook and prepare a new one,â said Prof G Haragopal. Kadyan has so far filed 250 such complaints, including those in the states of Jharkhand, Haryana, Punjab and Assam. In most cases, state governments were hauled up as they were not displaying the state emblem properly and corrections were made.

The Church of South India (CSI) is a united Protestant Church in India . It is the result of union of a number of Protestant denominations in South India that occurred after the independence of India. [3] [7]
The Church of South India is the successor of a number of Protestant denominations in India, including the four southern dioceses of the Church of India, Burma and Ceylon ( Anglican ), the South India United Church ( Congregationalist , Presbyterian and Continental Reformed ), and the southern district of the Methodist Church . [8] [9]
The Church of South India is a member of the Anglican Communion , World Methodist Council and World Communion of Reformed Churches . [10] [3] It is one of four united Protestant churches in the Anglican Communion, World Methodist Council and World Communion of Reformed Churches, with the others being the Church of North India , the Church of Pakistan , and the Church of Bangladesh .
Being a United Protestant denomination, the inspiration for the Church of South India came from ecumenism and the words of Jesus as recorded in the Gospel of John ( 17.21 ); as such ""That they all may be one"" is the motto of the Church of South India. [5]
With a membership of nearly four million, [4] [5] it is the second-largest Christian church based on the number of members in India.
History
[ edit ]
Four different church traditions were brought together in the CSI: Anglican, Congregational, Presbyterian, and Methodist. All these churches had been established in India through the missionary work of churches in Europe, America, and Australia, which had started their work in India at different periods from the beginning of the 18th century.
The Church of South India Scheme was the first practical attempt of its kind toward a union, on the basis of the following points enunciated in the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral :
The Holy Scripture of the Old and the New Testaments as containing all things necessary to salvation and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith.
The Apostles' Creed as the Baptismal Symbol and the Nicene Creed as sufficient statement of the Christian faith.
The two sacraments, ordained by Christ Himself — Baptism and the Supper of the Lord — ministered with the unfailing use of Christ's words of Institution and elements ordained by Him.
The Historic Episcopate , locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying need of the nations and people called of God into the union of His Church. [11] [12]
The first three points could be accepted without any controversial question. But the fourth became contentious, as the Anglican Church maintained episcopal polity within the historical episcopate and believed that all its bishops and priests could trace an unbroken line of succession from St. Peter ; whereas the rest of the churches in the negotiations conformed to other ecclesiastical polities and did not subscribe to the Anglican views on apostolic succession . After extensive dialogues, an agreement was reached that all who were already ordained in any of the uniting churches would be received as ministers in the united Church; provided all new ordinations after the union, would be conferred by episcopally ordained bishops of the united Church, with the imposition of hands. The intention was to introduce an episcopate in historic succession (from Anglicanism) into the new united Church and to ensure its maintenance in the future, by keeping all subsequent ordinations episcopal. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]
The Church of South India as it exists today came into being with the perseverance and committed efforts of Rev. Vedam Santiago,[ citation needed ] who for a long period of time took leadership of the SIUC, the South Indian United Churches, which later, with the joint efforts of Rev. V Santiago[ citation needed ] and Bishop Azariah became the Church of South India.
Formation
[ edit ]
The Church of South India union ceremony happened at St George's Cathedral in Madras on 27 September 1947, a month after India achieved its independence from the United Kingdom . It was formed from the union of the SIUC, (South India United Church itself a union of churches from the Congregational , Presbyterian and Reformed traditions); the southern provinces of the (Anglican) Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon ; and the Methodist Church of South India. [18] The inaugural service was presided by Bishop Rt. Rev. C. K. Jacob , of the Anglican diocese of Travancore and Cochin . [19] As part of it, nine new bishops, drawn from all the traditions, were consecrated to serve with five Anglican bishops already in the office. [19] Each new bishop was ordained with the imposition of hands by the presiding bishop, along with two more Anglican bishops (Rt. Rev. A. M. Hollis and Rt. Rev. G. T. Selwynthe) and six presbyters from the uniting Churches, also laying hands. [19] This reconciliation of the Anglican views with those of the other uniting denominations, on the doctrine of apostolic succession , realized in the formation of the Church of South India, is often cited as a landmark in the ecumenical movement. [20] [21] [22] [19]

[ edit ]
The logo of the Church of South India consists of a Cross superimposed on a stylized Lotus flower in a white backdrop; around which the motto and name of the Church, is embossed. [23] It was designed by J. Vasanthan of the American College, Madurai .
The imposing central position of the Cross denotes the foundation of the Church and its faith, while its four arms of the same length promulgates equality. The Lotus flower , called Pankaj meaning ""mud-born"" in Sanskrit , has been of great spiritual and symbolic significance in India, since ancient times. [24] [25] Its placement in the Logo, proclaims the indigenous nature of the Church of South India and its dependence on the grace of God, just as a Lotus that blooms at sunrise and closes at sunset, depends on the Sun . The stylized rendering, makes the Lotus petals simultaneously depict the fiery split tongues of the Holy Spirit . The motto of the CSI embossed on the logo, which is an excerpt of Jesus 's prayer in John 17:21, is used as an inclusive affirmation of the need for the unity of all people. [26] [23] [27]
Beliefs and practices
[ edit ]
The Church of South India is a Trinitarian Church that draws from the traditions and heritage of its constituent denominations. The Church accepts the Chalcedonian Christological Definition , [28] [29] as well as the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed . Both creeds are included in the Church liturgy as the profession of faith . [30] [31] The Church practices infant baptism for children born in Christian homes and adult or believer's baptism for others. Baptized children are members of the church and share in the privileges and obligations of membership so far as they are capable of doing so. [32] [33]
The Church of South India practices the rite of Confirmation , by which the confirmands (those being confirmed) upon profession of their Christian faith, obtain confirmation of their baptisms and thereafter, get to partake fully in the privileges and obligations associated with Church membership. Secondarily, this is also a coming of age ceremony. Confirmation is almost always administered by a Bishop with the imposition of hands and occasionally by a Presbyter who is authorized to confirm. [30] [34] [35]
Capital punishment
The Church of South India opposes the death penalty. [36]
Women's Ordination
In 2013, the CSI consecrated its first female bishop, Eggoni Pushpalalitha . [37] [38] The Church of South India, since 1984, has allowed women's ordination . [39] Additionally, ""it has taken up issues of gender, dalits and landlessness ."" [39] [40] [41] [42]
LGBTQ issues
[ edit ]
In 2008, CSI supported the faction of the Anglican Church— Global Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (GAFCON)— which opposed allowing gay priests inside church. “The Bible does not recognise gay marriages or gay priests,” said Reverend Benny Thomas of CSI, Mumbai. [43] Indian bishops sided with traditionalists on the issue of homosexuality. [44] The church does not ordain clergy who are active in same-sex relationships. [45]
The National Council of Churches in India , of which the CSI is a member, supported the legalization of consensual same-sex relationships in India. [46] [47] In 2015, St. Mark's Cathedral, Bangalore hosted an event, co-led by the Rev. Vincent Rajkumar, aimed at denouncing homophobia. [48] CSI clergy, working with the National Council of Churches in India also co-led a consultation speaking out against homophobia. [49] The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) listed the Church of South India as being among the Anglican provinces open to blessing same-sex couples . [50] [51]
In 2016, a seminary affiliated with the CSI offered a seminar on LGBT issues. ""The Tamil Nadu Theological Seminary in Madurai held a two-hour seminar on gender and sexuality..."" [52] However, in 2023 the Communion of Churches in India, of which the CSI is a part, [53] filed an application before the Supreme Court opposing petitions for same-sex marriage, writing that marriage is a divine institution uniting two persons of the opposite sex, and also writing to the President of India on the subject. [54]
Some dioceses of the church have confirmed that transgender persons may be ordained as clergy. [55] On transgender issues, the Diocese of Madras has a ministry specifically for transgender people. [56] In 2012, the denomination invited a transgender pastor to preach. [57]
Liturgy
[ edit ]
The CSI Synod Liturgical Congress has developed several new orders for worship for different occasions. [58] The order for the Communion service, known as the CSI Liturgy, has been internationally acclaimed as an important model for new liturgies. The committee has also produced three different cycles of lectionaries for daily Bible readings and ""propers"", and collects for Communion services. In addition, the committee has also brought out a supplement to the Book of Common Worship. [58] Cherishing the reformation principle of worship in the native language, the CSI liturgy and church services are completely in the vernacular, in all the different South Indian states and Northern Sri Lanka , which comprise its ecclesiastical province .

Temple legend
[ edit ]
According to the Skanda Purana , Yada, the son of the sage performed penance here to the god Narasimha . Being pleased with his penance, Narasimha manifested himself in five forms: Jvala Narasimha, Gandabherunda Narasimha, Yogananda Narasimha, Ugra Narasimha, and Lakshmi Narasimha . [5] Yada requested Narasimha to remain on the hill in these forms. For this reason, the temple has deities of Narasimha in all five forms enshrined in stone in the main cave. Historically, the temple has followed the Tenkalai tradition of the Vaishnava Agama Shastras as followed in South India . [6]
Deities in the temple
[ edit ]
The temple is in a cave about 3.7 metres (12 ft) high by 9.1 metres (30 ft) long, located in back of the temple hall, by the rear pillar. There is a stairway down into the chamber and then towards the back. Jvala Narasimha is in the shape of a serpent, while Yogananda Narasimha appears sitting in meditation in yoga pose. The silver icon of Lakshmi-Narasimha is installed in the main shrine. To the right of the temple main door is a Hanuman temple. There is a long horizontal gap in the rock just below Hanuman. This is said to be where Gandaberunda Narasimha manifested. It is said that any wish of a sincere devotee visiting this temple will be fulfilled. [7] [8] The sanctum sanctorum or garbhagriha is located in a cave, under a huge slating rock, which covers half the temple.
New Yadadri Temple
[ edit ]
A new temple was built at the old temple site. A temporary temple, Balalayam, was built till the renovation was on. The temple was rebuilt in the Krishna Sila (Black stone). [9] The new temple was inaugurated on 28 March 2022 by Chief Minister of Telangana K. Chandrasekhar Rao . [10]
Donations and renovations
[ edit ]
The then Chief Minister of Telangana , K. Chandrashekhar Rao initiated the renovation of the temple, and approved a final layout [11] Major renovation of the temple is being taken up with a budget of ₹1800 crores. [12] [13] The work started in 2016 and is being executed  and completed in March 2022 by Yadadri Temple Development Authority (YTDA). [14] The temple owned 39 kilos of gold and 1,753 tonnes of silver for lining the gopurams and walls in the temple. The centuries-old practice of using lime mortar to join different stone parts is being used. [15] The YTDA acquired around 770 hectares (1,900 acres) by spending ₹300 crores. [16] He also constructed houses near vishnu gundam (a place for taking bath).
The Seventh Nizam of Hyderabad , Mir Osman Ali Khan during his time had passed a grant of Rs.82,825 to this temple. [17] [18]
In Feb 2023, on behalf of the Nizam family, Princess Esra wife of 8th Nizam gifted jewellery worth 8 Lakh Rupees to the temple. [19] [20]
Sections
[ edit ]
The sections of the temple include the main temple, Mukha Mandapam, seven gopurams (domes) with wooden roofs, vratha peetham, Swamy Vari Udyana Vanam, kalyana mandapam, satram etc. The pillars of 12 Alvars (the poet-saints of Sri Vaishnavism) in the main temple is a significant feature. [21]

there is vishnu gundam. It is also proved that when we bath, all bad things are washed  away from us.
Temple architecture
[ edit ]
The main gopuram in 2014.
The architecture of the temple is based on Agama Shastra . The temple is built entirely in stone. The temple was earlier built on 0.81 hectares (2 acres). After demolishing all structures on the temple hillock, the base for the temple is now 6.5 hectares (16 acres).
Design
[ edit ]
The principal film set designer is Anand Sai and lead architect P Madhusudhan, chosen for their understanding of the ancient designs based on silpa and Agama principles. The entire temple is built in stone. The stone designs in Yadadri were provided by the chief sthapathi of the temple, Sundararajan Srinivasan. [22]
Sculptures
[ edit ]
Three types of stones are being used for the temple like Krishna Sila (also known as Purusha Sila) for presiding deities in the sanctum sanctorum; Sthri Sila for deities of Goddesses; and Napunsaka Sila used for flooring, walls etc. Black granite stone is also used, based on the temple architecture of the Kakatiya dynasty in Telangana. The black granite stone has tiny pores, and it becomes strong and hard when milk, curd, oil and other liquids get into those pores, according to learned shilipis (sculpture experts).
Transport
[ edit ]
Yadagirigutta is well connected by both rail and road. It is about 55 km from Uppal , a major suburb of Hyderabad and 65 km from Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station at Hyderabad. A new bus stand is built on a 6.1 hectares (15 acres), as a part of new temple development. [23] The proposed Hyderabad Regional Ring Road passes through Yadagirigutta.
The nearest railway stations are Raigiri about 5 km away and Bhuvanagiri , a major town of Hyderabad Metropolitan Region about 13 km away. Raigir railway station has been renamed as Yadadri(YADD) by South Central Railway in line with the new nomenclature of the temple town. [24] The Hyderabad MMTS - Phase II is planned, to be extended from Ghatkesar to Raigir station, which is 5 km from Yadagirigutta. [25] A metro train is proposed between Uppal and Yadagirigutta.

* [[Charminar]], built in 1591 CE, is a monument and mosque located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The landmark has become a global icon of Hyderabad, listed among the most recognized structures of India. The Charminar is on the east bank of Musi river. To the northeast lies the Laad Bazaar and in the west end lies the granite-made richly ornamented Makkah Masjid. The English name is a transliteration and combination of the Urdu words Chār and Minar, translating to ""Four Towers""; the eponymous towers are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches.
* [[Golkonda|Golconda Fort]] – Once abandoned by Qutub Shahis, Golconda Fort is one of the most magnificent fortress complexes in India.

Culture of India
hide
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This article is about culture of the modern-day Republic of India. For culture of the Indian subcontinent, see South Asian culture .
e
Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse India, pertaining to the Indian subcontinent until 1947 and the Republic of India post-1947. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia . India's languages , religions , dance , music , architecture , food , and customs differ from place to place within the country.
Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures, has been influenced by a history that is several millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley Civilization and other early cultural areas. [1] [2]
Many elements of Indian culture, such as Indian religions , mathematics , philosophy , cuisine , languages , dance , music , and movies have had a profound impact across the Indosphere , Greater India , and the world. The British Raj further influenced Indian culture, such as through the widespread introduction of the English language , which resulted in a local English dialect and influences on the Indian languages. [3]
Religious culture
Indian-origin religions Hinduism , Jainism , Buddhism , and Sikhism , [4] are all based on the concepts of dharma and karma . Ahimsa , the philosophy of nonviolence , is an important aspect of native Indian faiths whose most well-known proponent was Shri Mahatma Gandhi , who used civil disobedience to unite India during the Indian independence movement – this philosophy further inspired Martin Luther King Jr. and James Bevel during the American civil rights movement . Foreign-origin religion, including Abrahamic religions , such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam, are also present in India, [5] as well as Zoroastrianism [6] [7] and Baháʼí Faith [8] [9] both escaping persecution by Islam [10] [11] [12] have also found shelter in India over the centuries. [13] [14]
India has 28 states and 8 union territories with different cultures and is the most populated country in the world. [15] The Indian culture, often labeled as an amalgamation of several various cultures, spans across the Indian subcontinent and has been influenced and shaped by a history that is several thousand years old. [1] [2] Throughout the history of India, Indian culture has been heavily influenced by Dharmic religions. [16] Influence from East/Southeast Asian cultures onto ancient India and early Hinduism, specifically via Austroasiatic groups , such as early Munda and Mon Khmer , but also Tibetic and other Tibeto-Burmese groups, had noteworthy impact on local Indian peoples and cultures. Several scholars, such as Professor Przyluski, Jules Bloch, and Lévi, among others, concluded that there is a significant cultural, linguistic, and political Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic) influence on early India, which can also be observed by Austroasiatic loanwords within Indo-Aryan languages and rice cultivation , which was introduced by East/Southeast Asian rice-agriculturalists using a route from Southeast Asia through Northeast India into the Indian subcontinent. [17] [18] They have been credited with shaping much of Indian philosophy , literature , architecture , art and music . [19] Greater India was the historical extent of Indian culture beyond the Indian subcontinent . This particularly concerns the spread of Hinduism , Buddhism , architecture , administration and writing system from India to other parts of Asia through the Silk Road by the travelers and maritime traders during the early centuries of the Common Era . [20] [21] To the west, Greater India overlaps with Greater Persia in the Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains . [22] Over the centuries, there has been a significant fusion of cultures between Buddhists , Hindus , Muslims , Jains , Sikhs and various tribal populations in India. [23] [24]
India is the birthplace of Hinduism , Buddhism , Jainism , Sikhism , and other religions .  They are collectively known as Indian religions. [25] Indian religions are a major form of world religions along with Abrahamic ones. Today, Hinduism and Buddhism are the world's third and fourth-largest religions respectively, with over 2 billion followers altogether, [26] [27] [28] and possibly as many as 2.5 or 2.6 billion followers. [26] [29] Followers of Indian religions – Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists make up around 80–82% population of India.
India is one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse nations in the world, with some of the most deeply religious societies and cultures. Religion plays a central and definitive role in the lives of many of its people. Although India is a secular Hindu-majority country, it has a large Muslim population. Except for Jammu and Kashmir , Punjab , Meghalaya , Nagaland , Mizoram and Lakshadweep , Hindus form the predominant population in all 28 states and 8 union territories. Muslims are present throughout India, with large populations in Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Maharashtra , Kerala , Telangana , Andhra Pradesh , West Bengal and Assam ; while only Jammu and Kashmir and Lakshadweep have majority Muslim populations. Christians are other significant minorities of India.
Because of the diversity of religious groups in India, there has been a history of turmoil and violence between them. India has been a theatre for violent religious clashes between members of different religions such as Hindus , Christians , Muslims , and Sikhs . [30] Several groups have founded various national-religious political parties, and in spite of government policies minority religious groups are being subjected to prejudice from more dominant groups in order to maintain and control resources in particular regions of India. [30]
According to the 2011 census, 79.8% of the population of India practice Hinduism . Islam (14.2%), Christianity (2.3%), Sikhism (1.7%), Buddhism (0.7%) and Jainism (0.4%) are the other major religions followed by the people of India. [31] Many tribal religions , such as Sarnaism , are found in India, though these have been affected by major religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity. [32] Jainism, Zoroastrianism , Judaism , and the Baháʼí Faith are also influential but their numbers are smaller. [32] Atheism and agnostics also have visible influence in India, along with a self-ascribed tolerance to other faiths. [32]
Atheism and agnosticism have a long history in India and flourished within Śramaṇa movement . The Cārvāka school originated in India around the 6th century BCE. [33] [34] It is one of the earliest form of materialistic and atheistic movement in ancient India. [35] [36] Sramana , Buddhism , Jainism , Ājīvika and some schools of Hinduism consider atheism to be valid and reject the concept of creator deity , ritualism and superstitions . [37] [38] [39] India has produced some notable atheist politicians and social reformers . [40] According to the 2012 WIN-Gallup Global Index of Religion and Atheism report, 81% of Indians were religious, 13% were not religious, 3% were convinced atheists , and 3% were unsure or did not respond. [41] [42]
Philosophy
Indian philosophical traditions
Earliest Hindu philosophy were arranged and codified by Hindu Vedic sages, such as Yajnavalkya (c. 8th century BCE), who is considered one of the earliest philosophers in recorded history , after Aruni (c. 8th century BCE). [43]
Jain philosophy were propagated by 24 Tirthankaras , notably Parshvanatha (c. 872 – c. 772 BCE) and Mahavira (c. 549–477 BCE).
Sikh philosophy was crystallised in Guru Granth Sahib enshrined by Guru Gobind Singh (c. 1666–1708 CE).
Indian philosophy comprises the philosophical traditions of the Indian subcontinent . There are six schools of orthodox Hindu philosophy — Nyaya , Vaisheshika , Samkhya , Yoga , Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta —and four heterodox schools— Jain , Buddhist , Ājīvika and Cārvāka – last two are also schools of Hinduism. [44] [45] However, there are other methods of classification; Vidyarania for instance identifies sixteen schools of Indian philosophy by including those that belong to the Śaiva and Raseśvara traditions. [46] Since medieval India (ca.1000–1500), schools of Indian philosophical thought have been classified by the Brahmanical tradition [47] [48] as either orthodox or non-orthodox – āstika or nāstika – depending on whether they regard the Vedas as an infallible source of knowledge. [42]
The main schools of Indian philosophy were formalized chiefly between 1000 BCE to the early centuries of the Common Era . According to philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , the earliest of these, which date back to the composition of the Upanishads in the later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE) , constitute ""the earliest philosophical compositions of the world."" [49] Competition and integration between the various schools were intense during their formative years, especially between 800 BCE and 200 CE. Some schools like Jainism, Buddhism, Śaiva, and Advaita Vedanta survived, but others, like Samkhya and Ājīvika , did not; they were either assimilated or became extinct. Subsequent centuries produced commentaries and reformulations continuing up to as late as the 20th century. Authors who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophies include Shrimad Rajchandra , Swami Vivekananda , Ram Mohan Roy , and Swami Dayananda Saraswati . [50]
Family structure and wedding

For generations, India has had a prevailing tradition of the joint family system . It is when extended members of a family – parents, children, the children's spouses, and their offspring, etc. – live together. Usually, the oldest male member is the head of the joint Indian family system. He mostly makes all important decisions and rules, and other family members are likely to abide by them. With the current economy, lifestyle, and cost of living in most of the metro cities are high, the population is leaving behind the joint family model and adapting to the nuclear family model. Earlier living in a joint family was with the purpose of creating love and concern for the family members. However, now it's a challenge to give time to each other as most of them are out for survival needs. [51] Rise in the trends of nuclear family settings has led to a change in the traditional family headship structure and older males are no longer the mandated heads of the family as they mostly live alone during old age and are far more vulnerable than before. [52]
In a 1966 study, Orenstein and Micklin analysed India's population data and family structure. Their studies suggest that Indian household sizes had remained similar over the 1911 to 1951 period. Thereafter, with urbanisation and economic development, India has witnessed a break up of traditional joint family into more nuclear-like families. [53] [54] Sinha, in his book, after summarising the numerous sociological studies done on the Indian family, notes that over the last 60 years, the cultural trend in most parts of India has been an accelerated change from joint family to nuclear families, much like population trends in other parts of the world. The traditionally large joint family in India, in the 1990s, accounted for a small percent of Indian households, and on average had lower per capita household income. He finds that joint family still persists in some areas and in certain conditions, in part due to cultural traditions and in part due to practical factors. [53] Youth in lower socio-economic classes are more inclined to spend time with their families than their peers due to differing ideologies in rural and urban parenting. [55] With the spread of education and growth of economics, the traditional joint-family system is breaking down rapidly across India and attitudes towards working women have changed.
Arranged marriage

Arranged marriages have long been the norm in Indian society. Even today, the majority of Indians have their marriages planned by their parents and other respected family members. In the past, the age of marriage was young. [56] The average age of marriage for women in India has increased to 21 years, according to the 2011 Census of India. [57] In 2009, about 7% of women got married before the age of 18. [58]
In most marriages, the bride's family provides a dowry to the bridegroom. Traditionally, the dowry was considered a woman's share of the family wealth, since a daughter had no legal claim on her natal family's real estate. It also typically included portable valuables such as jewelry and household goods that a bride could control throughout her life. [59] Historically, in most families the inheritance of family estates passed down the male line. Since 1956, Indian laws treat males and females as equal in matters of inheritance without a legal will. [60] Indians are increasingly using a legal will for inheritance and property succession, with about 20 percent using a legal will by 2004. [61]
In India, the divorce rate is low — 1% compared with about 40% in the United States. [62] [63] These statistics do not reflect a complete picture, though. There is a dearth of scientific surveys or studies on Indian marriages where the perspectives of both husbands and wives were solicited in-depth. Sample surveys suggest the issues with marriages in India are similar to trends observed elsewhere in the world. The divorce rates are rising in India. Urban divorce rates are much higher. Women initiate about 80 percent of divorces in India. [64]
Opinion is divided over what the phenomenon means: for traditionalists, the rising numbers portend the breakdown of society while, for some modernists, they speak of healthy new empowerment for women. [65]
Recent studies suggest that Indian culture is trending away from traditional arranged marriages. Banerjee et al. surveyed 41,554 households across 33 states and union territories in India in 2005. They find that the marriage trends in India are similar to trends observed over the last 40 years in China , Japan , and other nations. [66] The study found that fewer marriages are purely arranged without consent and that the majority of surveyed Indian marriages are arranged with consent. The percentage of self-arranged marriages (called love marriages in India) was also increasing, particularly in the urban parts of India. [67]
Wedding rituals
[ edit ]
A Hindu wedding ritual in progress. The bride and the groom are seated together, receiving instructions from the priest. The sacred square fire container ( yajna kund) is behind the priest.
Weddings are festive occasions in India with extensive decorations, colors, music, dance, costumes and rituals that depend on the religion of the bride and the groom, as well as their preferences. [68] The nation celebrates about 10 million weddings per year, [69] of which over 80% are Hindu weddings .
While there are many festival-related rituals in Hinduism, vivaha (wedding) is the most extensive personal ritual an adult Hindu undertakes in his or her life. [70] [71] Typical Hindu families spend significant effort and financial resources to prepare and celebrate weddings. The rituals and processes of a Hindu wedding vary depending on the region of India, local adaptations, family resources and preferences of the bride and the groom. Nevertheless, there are a few key rituals common in Hindu weddings – Kanyadaan , Panigrahana, and Saptapadi ; these are respectively, gifting away of daughter by the father, voluntarily holding hand near the fire to signify impending union, and taking seven circles before firing with each circle including a set of mutual vows. Mangalsutra necklace of bond a Hindu groom ties with three knots around the bride's neck in a marriage ceremony. The practice is integral to a marriage ceremony as prescribed in Manusmriti , the traditional law governing Hindu marriage. After the seventh circle and vows of Saptapadi , the couple is legally husband and wife. [71] [72] [73] Sikhs get married through a ceremony called Anand Karaj . The couple walks around the holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib four times. Indian Muslims celebrate a traditional Islamic wedding following customs similar to those practiced in the Middle East . The rituals include Nikah, payment of financial dower called Mahr by the groom to the bride, signing of a marriage contract, and a reception. [74] Indian Christian weddings follow customs similar to those practiced in the Christian countries in the West in states like Goa but have more Indian customs in other states.

The government also provides facilities for the celebration of all religious festivals with equality and grants road bookings, security, etc. providing equality to the diverse religions and their festivals.
Chapchar Kut cheraw dance in Mizoram . Chapchar Kut festival is celebrated during March after completion of their most arduous task of Jhum operation i.e., jungle-clearing (clearing of the remnants of burning).
The Indian New Year festival is celebrated in different parts of India with a unique style at different times. Ugadi , Bihu , Gudhi Padwa , Puthandu , Vaisakhi , Pohela Boishakh , Vishu and Vishuva Sankranti are the New Year festival of different part of India.
Certain festivals in India are celebrated by multiple religions. Notable examples include Diwali , which is celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains across the country and Buddha Purnima , Krishna Janmashtami , Ambedkar Jayanti celebrated by Buddhists and Hindus. Sikh festivals, such as Guru Nanak Jayanti , Baisakhi are celebrated with full fanfare by Sikhs and Hindus of Punjab and Delhi where the two communities together form an overwhelming majority of the population. Adding colours to the culture of India, the Dree Festival is one of the tribal festivals of India celebrated by the Apatanis of the Ziro valley of Arunachal Pradesh , which is the easternmost state of India. Nowruz is the most important festival among the Parsi community of India.
Islam in India is the second largest religion with over 172 million Muslims, according to India's 2011 census. [31] The Islamic festivals which are observed and are declared public holiday in India are; Eid al-Fitr , Eid al-Adha (Bakri Eid), Milad-un-Nabi , Muharram and Shab-e-Barat . [78] Some of the Indian states have declared regional holidays for the particular regional popular festivals; such as Arba'een , Jumu'ah-tul-Wida and Shab-e-Qadar .
Christianity in India is the third-largest religion with over 27.8 million Christians, according to India's 2011 census. [79] With over 27.8 million Christians, of which 17 million are Roman Catholics, India is home to many Christian festivals. The country celebrates Christmas and Good Friday as public holidays. [78]
Regional and community fairs are also a common festivals in India. For example, Pushkar Fair of Rajasthan is one of the world's largest markets of cattle and livestock.
The women lift & carry other women at many festivals.
Greetings
Indian greetings are based on Añjali Mudrā , including Pranāma and Puja .
Greetings include Namaste (Hindi,Sanskrit and Kannada), Nômôskar in Odia , Khulumkha ( Tripuri ), Namaskar ( Marathi ), Namaskara (Kannada and Sanskrit), Paranaam ( Bhojpuri ), Namaskaram ( Telugu , Malayalam ), Vanakkam ( Tamil ), Nômôshkar ( Bengali ), Nomoskar ( Assamese ), Aadab ( Urdu ), and Sat Shri Akal ( Punjabi ). All these are commonly spoken greetings or salutations when people meet and are forms of farewell when they depart. Namaskar is considered slightly more formal than Namaste but both express deep respect. Namaskar is commonly used in India and Nepal by Hindus , Jains and Buddhists, and many continue to use this outside the Indian subcontinent . In Indian and Nepali culture , the word is spoken at the beginning of written or verbal communication. However, the same hands folded gesture may be made wordlessly or said without the folded hand gesture. The word is derived from Sanskrit (Namah): to bow , reverential salutation , and respect , and (te): ""to you"". Taken literally, it means ""I bow to you"". [80] In Hinduism it means ""I bow to the divine in you."" [81] [82] In most Indian families, younger men and women are taught to seek the blessing of their elders by reverentially bowing to their elders. This custom is known as Pranāma .
Pressing hands together with a smile to greet Namaste – a common cultural practice in India .
Other greetings include Jai Jagannath (used in Odia ) Ami Aschi (used in Bengali ), Jai Shri Krishna (in Gujarati and the Braj Bhasha and Rajasthani dialects of Hindi ), Ram Ram/(Jai) Sita Ram ji ( Awadhi and Bhojpuri dialects of Hindi and other Bihari dialects ), and Sat Sri Akal ( Punjabi ; used by followers of Sikhism ), As-salamu alaykum ( Urdu ; used by follower of Islam ), Jai Jinendra (a common greeting used by followers of Jainism ), Jai Bhim (used by followers of Ambedkarism ), Namo Buddhay (used by followers of Buddhism ), Allah Abho (used by followers of the Baháʼí Faith ), Shalom aleichem (used by followers of Judaism ), Hamazor Hama Ashobed (used by followers of Zoroastrianism ), Sahebji ( Persian and Gujarati ; used by the Parsi people), Dorood ( Persian and Gujarati ; used by the Irani people), Om Namah Shivaya /Jai Bholenath Jaidev (used in Dogri and Kashmiri , also used in the city of Varanasi ), Jai Ambe Maa/Jai Mata di (used in Eastern India ), Jai Ganapati Bapa (used in Marathi and Konkani ), etc.
These traditional forms of greeting may be absent in the world of business and in India's urban environment, where a handshake is a common form of greeting. [83]
Animals

The varied and rich wildlife of India has a profound impact on the region's popular culture. Common name for wilderness in India is jungle which was adopted by Britons living in India to the English language. The word has been also made famous in The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling . India's wildlife has been the subject of numerous other tales and fables such as the Panchatantra and the Jataka tales . [84]
In Hinduism, the cow is regarded as a symbol of ahimsa (non-violence), mother goddess and bringer of good fortune and wealth. [85] For this reason, cows are revered in Hindu culture and feeding a cow is seen as an act of worship. This is why beef remains a taboo food in mainstream Hindu and Jain society. [86]
The Article 48 of the Constitution of India is one of the Directive Principles which directs that the state shall endeavor to prohibit slaughtering and smuggling of cattle , calves and other milch and draught cattle . [87] [88] As of January 2012, cow remains a divisive and controversial topic in India. Several states of India have passed laws to protect cows, while many states have no restrictions on the production and consumption of beef. Some groups oppose the butchering of cows, while other secular groups argue that what kind of meat one eats ought to be a matter of personal choice in a democracy. Madhya Pradesh enacted a law in January 2012, namely the Gau-Vansh Vadh Pratishedh (Sanshodhan) Act, which makes cow slaughter a serious offence. [89]
Gujarat, a western state of India, has the Animal Preservation Act, enacted in October 2011, that prohibits the killing of cows along with buying, selling and transport of beef. In contrast, Assam and Andhra Pradesh allow butchering of cattle with a fit-for-slaughter certificate. In the states of West Bengal and Kerala, consumption of beef is not deemed an offence. Contrary to stereotypes, a sizeable number of Hindus eat beef, and many argue that their scriptures, such as Vedic and Upanishadic texts do not prohibit its consumption. In southern Indian state Kerala, for instance, beef accounts for nearly half of all meat consumed by all communities, including Hindus. Sociologists theorise that the widespread consumption of cow meat in India is because it is a far cheaper source of animal protein for the poor than mutton or chicken, which retail at double the price. For these reasons, India's beef consumption post-independence in 1947 has witnessed a much faster growth than any other kind of meat; currently, India is one of the five largest producers and consumers of cattle livestock meat in the world. A beef ban has been made in Maharashtra and other states as of 2015. While states such as Madhya Pradesh are passing local laws to prevent cruelty to cows, other Indians are arguing ""If the real objective is to prevent cruelty to animals, then why single out the cows when hundreds of other animals are maltreated?"" [90] [91] [92]
Cuisine
Main article: Indian cuisine
Indian cuisine is diverse, ranging from very spicy to very mild, varying with seasons in each region. These reflect the local agriculture , regional climate , culinary innovations and cultural diversity. Food in India is sometimes served in thali – a plate with rice, bread and a selection of sides. Above are thali samples.
Indian food is as diverse as India. Indian cuisines use numerous ingredients, deploy a wide range of food preparation styles, cooking techniques, and culinary presentations. From salads to sauces, from vegetarian to meat, from spices to sensuous, from bread to desserts, Indian cuisine is invariably complex. Harold McGee, a favourite of many Michelin-starred chefs, writes ""for sheer inventiveness with the milk itself as the primary ingredient, no country on earth can match India."" [93]
I travel to India at least three to four times a year. It's always inspirational. There is so much to learn from India because each and every state is a country by itself and each has its own cuisine. There are lots of things to learn about the different cuisines – it just amazes me. I keep my mind open and like to explore different places and pick up different influences as I go along. I don't actually think that there is a single state in India that I haven't visited. 
Indian food is a cosmopolitan cuisine that has so many ingredients. I don't think any cuisine in the world has got so many influences on the way that Indian food has. It is a very rich cuisine and is very varied. Every region in the world has its own sense of how Indian food should be perceived.
Atul Kochhar , the first Indian to receive two Michelin stars [94]
... it takes me back to the first Christmas I can remember, when the grandmother I hadn't yet met, who was Indian and lived in England, sent me a box. For me it still carries the taste of strangeness and confusion and wonder.
Harold McGee , author of On Food and Cooking [95]
A typical varieties of North Indian dishes in a restaurant
According to Sanjeev Kapoor , a member of Singapore Airlines ' International Culinary Panel, Indian food has long been an expression of world cuisine. Kapoor claims, ""if you looked back in India's history and study the food that our ancestors ate, you will notice how much attention was paid to the planning and cooking of a meal. Great thought was given to the texture and taste of each dish."" [96] One such historical record is Mānasollāsa, ( Sanskrit : मानसोल्लास, The Delight of Mind), written in the 12th century. The book describes the need to change cuisine and food with seasons, various methods of cooking, the best blend of flavours, the feel of various foods, planning and style of dining amongst other things. [97]
India is known for its love of food and spices. Indian cuisine varies from region to region, reflecting the local produce, cultural diversity, and varied demographics of the country. Generally, Indian cuisine can be split into five categories – northern , southern , eastern, western, and northeastern. The diversity of Indian cuisine is characterised by the differing use of many spices and herbs, a wide assortment of recipes and cooking techniques. Though a significant portion of Indian food is vegetarian , many Indian dishes also include meats like chicken , mutton , beef (both cow and buffalo), pork and fish, egg and other seafood. Fish-based cuisines are common in eastern states of India, particularly West Bengal and the southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu . [98]
Some Indian confectionery desserts from hundreds of varieties. In certain parts of India, these are called mithai or sweets. Sugar and desserts have a long history in India: by about 500 BCE, people in India had developed the technology to produce sugar crystals. In the local language, these crystals were called khanda (खण्ड), which is the source of the word candy. [99]
Despite this diversity, some unifying threads emerge. Varied uses of spices are an integral part of certain food preparations and are used to enhance the flavour of a dish and create unique flavours and aromas. Cuisine across India has also been influenced by various cultural groups that entered India throughout history, such as the Central Asians , Arabs , Mughals , and European colonists . Sweets are also very popular among Indians, particularly in West Bengal where both Bengali Hindus and Bengali Muslims distribute sweets to mark joyous occasions. There is specifically evidence for early influences from East and Southeast Asian-derived cultural areas, primarily via Austroasiatic ( Mon Khmer ) groups during the Neolithic period , on certain cultural and political elements of Ancient India , and which may have arrived together with the spread of rice cultivation from Mainland Southeast Asia . A significant number of ethnic minorities in central , eastern and northeastern India are Austroasiatic language speakers, most notably the Munda and Khasic . [100] [101] [102] [103] [104]
Chicken tikka masala is an Indian dish which became the national dish of The United Kingdom . It was made popular by Indian Immigrants living in Britain.
Indian cuisine is one of the most popular cuisines across the globe. [105] In most Indian restaurants outside India, the menu does not do justice to the enormous variety of Indian cuisine available – the most common cuisine served on the menu would be Punjabi cuisine ( chicken tikka masala is a very popular dish in the United Kingdom). There do exist some restaurants serving cuisines from other regions of India, although these are few and far between. Historically, Indian spices and herbs were one of the most sought after trade commodities. The spice trade between India and Europe led to the rise and dominance of Arab traders to such an extent that European explorers, such as Vasco da Gama and Christopher Columbus , set out to find new trade routes with India leading to the Age of Discovery . [106] The popularity of curry , which originated in India, across Asia has often led to the dish being labeled as the ""pan-Asian"" dish. [107]
Regional Indian cuisine continues to evolve. A fusion of East Asian and Western cooking methods with traditional cuisines, along with regional adaptations of fast food are prominent in major Indian cities. [108]

The cuisine of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana consists of the Telugu cuisine , of the Telugu people as well as Hyderabadi cuisine (also known as Nizami cuisine), of the Hyderabadi Muslim community . [109] [110] Hyderabadi food is based heavily on non-vegetarian ingredients while, Telugu food is a mix of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian ingredients. Telugu food is rich in spices and chillies are abundantly used. The food also generally tends to be more on the tangy side with tamarind and lime juice both used liberally as souring agents. Rice is the staple food of Telugu people. Starch is consumed with a variety of curries and lentil soups or broths . [111] [112] Vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods are both popular. Hyderabadi cuisine includes popular delicacies such as Biryani , Haleem , Baghara baingan and Kheema, while Hyderabadi day to day dishes see some commonalities with Telanganite Telugu food, with its use of tamarind, rice, and lentils, along with meat. [111] Yogurt is a common addition to meals, as a way of tempering spiciness . [113]
Clothing
Main article: Clothing in India
Traditional clothing in India greatly varies across different parts of the country and is influenced by local culture, geography, climate, and rural/urban settings. Popular styles of dress include draped garments such as sari and mekhela sador for women and the kurta , dhoti or lungi or panche (in Kannada) for men. Stitched clothes are also popular such as churidar or salwar-kameez for women, with dupatta (long scarf) thrown over shoulder completing the outfit. The salwar is often loose fitting, while churidar is a tighter cut. [114] The dastar , a headgear worn by Sikhs is common in Punjab .
Indian women perfect their sense of charm and fashion with makeup and ornaments. Bindi , mehendi , earrings, bangles and other jewelry are common. On special occasions, such as marriage ceremonies and festivals, women may wear cheerful colours with various ornaments made with gold, silver or other regional stones and gems. Bindi is often an essential part of a Hindu woman's make up. Worn on their forehead, some consider the bindi as an auspicious mark. Traditionally, the red bindi was worn only by married Hindu women, and coloured bindi was worn by single women, but now all colours and glitter have become a part of women's fashion. Some women wear sindoor – a traditional red or orange-red powder (vermilion) in the parting of their hair (locally called mang). Sindoor is the traditional mark of a married woman for Hindus. Single Hindu women do not wear sindoor; neither do over 1 million Indian women from religions other than Hindu and agnostics/atheists who may be married. [114] The make up and clothing styles differ regionally between the Hindu groups, and also by climate or religion, with Christians preferring Western and Muslim preferring the Arabic styles. [115] For men, stitched versions include kurta - pyjama and European-style trousers and shirts. In urban and semi-urban centres, men and women of all religious backgrounds, can often be seen in jeans, trousers, shirts, suits, kurtas and variety of other fashions. [116]

Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation
Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation is the civic body of the city, which oversees the civic needs. Established in 1899, it is one of the oldest urban local bodies in India. [1] City planning is governed by the Kakatiya Urban Development Authority (KUDA), constituted in 1982 by the local government for the planning, development and management of the Kakatiya Urban Development Area. [27] It has its jurisdictional area spread over 1,805 km2 (697 sq mi), covering 19 mandals , 181 villages in the three districts of Warangal district , Hanamkonda and Jangaon . [28] As of 2016 [update] , the corporation has bagged a total of eleven awards in various categories, such as conservation, sanitation, heritage, etc. [1] : 6 [29] For electoral purpose, the city is divided into 58 electoral wards , of which 50% are reserved for women. A total of thirty seats are reserved for BC's (19), SC's (9) and ST's (2) respectively. [30]
In October 2012, the corporation conducted Clean Cities Championship, which invited professionals from 57 municipalities across the state for effective waste management and was won by Khammam Municipal Corporation . [31] [32] [33] Following the event, Warangal became the first city in India to achieve 100% door-to-door MSW collection . About 70% of households started practising two-bin MSW segregation into wet and dry waste. 420 cement bins and 128 dumpsters were removed from locations across Warangal making it a no dump city. [34] GWMC was able to reduce the MSW going to landfill by 30% to 40%. [35] and the dumpyard with significantly reduced load is, in phases, being converted into a nature park with vermicomposting sheds. [33]
Law and order

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is an Indian government agency  that is responsible for archaeological research and the conservation and preservation of cultural historical monuments in the country. It was founded in 1861 by Alexander Cunningham during the British Raj who also became its first Director-General.
History
[ edit ]
ASI was founded in 1861 by Alexander Cunningham who also became its first Director-General. The first systematic research into the subcontinent's history was conducted by the Asiatic Society , which was founded by the British Indologist Sir William Jones on 15 January 1784. Based in Calcutta , the society promoted the study of ancient Persian texts and published an annual journal titled Asiatic Researches. Notable among its early members was Charles Wilkins who published the first English translation of the Bhagavad Gita in 1785 with the patronage of the then Governor-General of Bengal , Warren Hastings .
Jones initiative resulted in the publication of Asiatick Researches, a monthly that was launched in 1788. [2] The Marquis of Wellesley's 1800 nomination of Francis Buchanan to survey Mysore was a wise move on the part of the administration at the time. He was hired in 1807 to investigate historical sites and monuments in what is now Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The first attempt at using the legal system to force the government to become involved when there was a risk to a monument was the Bengal Regulation XIX of 1810. The publication revealed the studies and polls that the society conducted to educate the public about India's ancient treasures. Many antiques and other relics were quickly discovered during the ongoing fieldwork, and in 1814 they were placed in a museum. Subsequently, comparable organisations were founded in Madras, Chennai, in 1818, and Bombay, Mumbai, in 1804. However, the most important of the society's achievements was the decipherment of the Brahmi script by James Prinsep in 1837. This successful decipherment inaugurated the asset.
Formation of the ASI
[ edit ]
Sir Alexander Cunningham
Armed with the knowledge of Brahmi, Alexander Cunningham , a protégé of James Prinsep , carried out a detailed survey of the Buddhist monuments of his own type to be constructed in the Nepalese tarai which lasted for over half a century. Inspired by early amateur archaeologists like the Italian military officer, Jean-Baptiste Ventura , Cunningham excavated stupas along the width, the length and breadth of India. While Cunningham funded many of his early excavations himself, in the long run, he realised the need for a permanent body to oversee archaeological excavations and the conservation of Indian monuments and used his stature and influence in India to lobby for an archaeological survey. While his attempt in 1848 did not meet with success, the Archaeological Survey of India was eventually formed in 1861 by a statute passed into law by Lord Canning with Cunningham as the first Archaeological Surveyor. The survey was suspended briefly between 1865 and 1871 due to lack of funds but restored by Lord Lawrence the then Viceroy of India . In 1871, the Survey was revived as a separate department and Cunningham was appointed as its first Director-General. [3]
1885–1901
[ edit ]
Cunningham retired in 1885 and was succeeded as Director General by James Burgess . Burgess launched a yearly journal The Indian Antiquary (1872) and an annual epigraphical publication Epigraphia Indica (1882) as a supplement to the Indian Antiquary. The post of Director General was permanently suspended in 1889 due to a funds crunch and was not restored until 1902. In the interim period, conservation work in the different areas was carried out by the superintendents of the individual areas.
""Buck crisis"" (1888–1898)
[ edit ]
Sir Edward Charles Buck (1838–1916), Civil servant in Bengal, India
From 1888 started severe lobbying aimed at reducing Government expenses, and at curtailing the budget of the Archaeological Survey of India, a period of about ten years known as the ""Buck crisis"", after the Liberal Edward Buck. [4] In effect, this severely threatened the employment of the employees of the ASI, such as Alois Anton Führer , who had just started a family and become a father. [4]
In 1892, Edward Buck announced that the Archaeological Survey of India would be shut down and all ASI staff would be dismissed by 1895, in order to generate savings for the Government's budget. [4] [5] It was understood that only a fantastic archaeological discovery within the next three years for example might be able to turn public opinion and save the funding of the ASI. [4]
Alois Anton Führer own report on his discoveries, entitled Monograph on Buddha Sakyamuni's birthplace , 1897, was withdrawn from circulation by the Government. [6]
Great ""discoveries"" were indeed made with the March 1895 discovery of the Nigali Sagar inscription, which succeeded in bringing the ""Buck Crisis"" to an end, and the ASI was finally allowed in June 1895 to continue operations, subject to yearly approval based on successful digs every year. [7] Georg Bühler , writing in July 1895 in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, continued to advocate for the preservation of the Archaeological Survey of India, and expressed that what was needed were ""new authentic documents"" from the pre-Ashokan period, and they would ""only be found underground"". [7] [8]
Another momentous discovery would be made in 1896, with the Lumbini pillar inscription , a major inscription on a pillar of Ashoka discovered by Alois Anton Führer . The inscription, together with other evidence, confirmed Lumbini as the birthplace of the Buddha. [9]
The organization was rocked when Führer was unmasked in 1898, and was found to file fraudulent reports about his investigations. Confronted by Smith about his archaeological publications and his report to the Government, Führer was obliged to admit ""that every statement in it [the report] was absolutely false."" [10] Under official instructions from the Government of India, Führer was relieved of his positions, his papers seized and his offices inspected by Vincent Arthur Smith on 22 September 1898. [11] Führer had written in 1897 a monograph on his discoveries in Nigali Sagar and Lumbini, Monograph on Buddha Sakyamuni's birth-place in the Nepalese tarai, [12] which was withdrawn from circulation by the Government. [6] Führer was dismissed and returned to Europe.

Map of India showing Pondicherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam
Pondicherry is the capital city of The Union Territory of Puducherry and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in South India.
A French colony until 1954, this coastal town retains a number of colonial buildings, churches, statues, and systematic town planning, as well as urban architecture of the local Tamil style. As such the town has been dubbed ""The Europe of India"". The town struggles to preserve what little remains of the ambiance once created by this unique mix of cultural heritage. [1] It nevertheless draws tourists from around the world and from across India. Recently after the advent of the internet and social media, Pondicherry has also become a popular weekend destination, which can be reached easily from the nearby cities such as Chennai and Bangalore , principally because lower taxation on alcoholic beverages makes drinking in the Union Territory enclave much less expensive than in neighboring states. [2]
The main tourist attractions in and around the city are listed below.
Sri Aurobindo Ashram
Sri Aurobindo Ashram , Pondicherry
The Sri Aurobindo Ashram is a well known spiritual ashram in India , with devotees and seekers from India and all over the world flocking to it for spiritual salvation. [3] Its spiritual tenets represent a synthesis of yoga and modern science. The Ashram was founded in 1926 by Sri Aurobindo Ghose , an Indian freedom fighter, poet, philosopher, and yogi. [4]
Mirra Alfassa (also known as ‘The Mother’:  French: La Mère) was spiritual collaborator of Sri Aurobindo, who was born in Paris and was so inspired by his philosophy that she stayed on in Pondicherry. [5] After 24 November 1926, when Sri Aurobindo retired into seclusion, she founded his ashram ( Sri Aurobindo Ashram ), with a handful of disciples living around the Master. With Sri Aurobindo's full approval she became the spiritual guru of the community, a position she held until her death. The Sri Aurobindo Ashram Trust, which she had registered after Sri Aurobindo's death in 1950 continues to look after the institution. The idea of Auroville or the ""City of Dawn"" was conceived by ‘The Mother’.
It is open to the public daily between 8 a.m.& 12 noon and 2 p.m.& 6 p.m. Children below 3 years of age are not allowed into the ashram and photography is not allowed. Some of the Ashram’s facilities like the Library and the Main Building (during collective meditation) can be accessed, only after obtaining a gate pass from the Bureau Central or some of the Ashram Guest Houses. It is located on 12, Rue De La Marine.
Auroville
[ edit ]
The Matrimandir , a golden metallic sphere in the center of town
Auroville (City of Dawn: French: Cité de l'aube) is an experimental township which is situated 8 km north-west of Pondicherry in East Coast Road Bommayapalayam. It was founded in 1968 by Mirra Alfassa (also known as The Mother), the spiritual collaborator of Sri Aurobindo . [6] As per the Mother's vision and guidance Auroville was designed by the French architect Roger Anger . [7] Auroville is meant to be a universal town where men and women of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony, above all creeds, all politics and all nationalities. The purpose of Auroville is to realize human unity. [8] During the inauguration ceremony of Auroville on 28 February 1968, soil from 124 countries was placed in a lotus-shaped urn and mixed to symbolize universal oneness. The Government of India and UNESCO has endorsed the project. [9]
In the middle of the town is the Matrimandir , which has been acclaimed as ""an outstanding and original architectural achievement."" [10] It was conceived by Alfassa as ""a symbol of Universal Mother"". [11]
Although originally intended to house 50,000, the actual population today is 2,007 (1,553 adults and 454 minors), coming from 44 nationalities, 836 of whom are of Indian origin. The community is divided up into neighborhoods with English , Sanskrit , French and Tamil names like Aspiration, Arati, La Ferme, and Isaiambalam.
The residents are involved in agriculture, administration, commerce and handicrafts, alternative technology, education, healthcare and development projects, the latter including AuroRE Systems, an international award-winning unit involved in solar photovoltaic and thermal systems. [12]
Monuments and statue

"Old City (Hyderabad, India) - Wikipedia",https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_City_Hyderabad,"www.ghmc.gov.in
The Old City of Hyderabad is a walled city of Hyderabad, Telangana , India , located on the banks of the Musi River built by Qutb Shahi sultan Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591 AD. There used to be a wall surrounding the Old City, most of which is destroyed. [3] Mubariz Khan , the Mughal governor of Deccan Subah, had fortified the city in 1712 and was completed by Nizam of Hyderabad. [4]
At the centre of Old City is the Charminar , and region contains major neighbourhoods of the city including Shah Ali Banda , Yakutpura , Dabirpura , Afzal Gunj , Moghalpura , Malakpet and Amberpet . Today, Hyderabad has expanded far beyond the boundaries of the Old City, and the crowded Old City remains the symbolic heart of cosmopolitan Hyderabad along with HITEC City . [5] [6] [7] The area is a tourism hotspot, and the heart of Hyderabadi Muslim culture.
Wall of Hyderabad
Main article: Wall of Hyderabad
There used to be a granite wall surrounding the old city. The wall was constructed during the 17th and 18th centuries, during the Qutb Shahi , Mughal and Asaf Jahi periods. The wall had thirteen gateways called darwazas and thirteen smaller entrances called khirkis.
Much of the wall was destroyed during the Great Musi Flood of 1908 , and also demolished by the Government in the 1950s and 1960s. [8]
Today, only two gates still stand – the Purana Pul Darwaza and the Dabeerpura Darwaza, [9] [10] and nothing except a few portions remains of the wall. [8] [11] [12]
Landmarks

As the historical region of Hyderabad, the old city contains many landmark buildings including Charminar (literally ""four minarets""), a structure built on the spot where Quli Qutb Shah prayed for the end to a plague epidemic.
The Qutb Shahi era structures surrounding the Charminar include an ornamented granite mosque Mecca Masjid to the southwest, and the Gulzar Houz fountain to the north, which is surrounded by four arch-gateways called Char Kaman .
Asaf Jahi monuments near the Charminar include the Mahboob Chowk Clock Tower and Nizamia Hospital . The Chowmahalla Palace was the seat of the Asaf Jahi dynasty where the Nizam entertained his official guests and royal visitors.
H.E.H The Nizams Museum , Purani Haveli. Home to the famous wardrobe of Mahbub Ali Pasha , who is said never to have worn the same thing twice, it is the world's longest wardrobe, built in two levels with a hand-cranked wooden lift. The device occupies the entire length of one wing of the palace.
The Purani Haveli was originally the palace of the Nizam's Parents, later renovated to become the quarters of the Nizam's son. It is a U-shaped complex with a single-story building in the European style.
Madina building , a few hundred metres North of Charminar , is one of the oldest commercial suburbs in the city opened in 1947 on the premises of the Aladdin Wakf. Abdul Boot House was one of oldest and renowned shops at Madina Market. Before the discovery of oil in that country, Hyderabad was richer than Saudi Arabia and the rents received from the area's buildings were sent to Saudi Arabia to help poor Muslims in Medina .

List of newspapers
The Hindu is an Indian English-language daily newspaper owned by The Hindu Group , headquartered in Chennai , Tamil Nadu . It was founded as a weekly publication in 1878 by the Triplicane Six , becoming a daily in 1889. [3] It is one of the Indian newspapers of record. [4] [5] [6] As of March 2018 [update] , The Hindu is published from 21 locations across 11 states of India. [7]
The Hindu has been a family-owned newspaper since 1905, when it was purchased by S. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar from the original founders. It is now jointly owned by Iyengar's descendants, referred to as the ""Kasturi family"", who serve as the directors of the holding company.
Except for a period of around two years, when S. Varadarajan held the editorship of the newspaper, senior editorial positions of the paper have always been held by members of the original Iyengar family or by those appointed by them under their direction. [8] In June 2023, the former chairperson of the group, Malini Parthasarathy , who is a great-granddaughter of Iyengar, [9] [10] announced the end of her term as chairperson of the group, citing ""ideological differences"" and the ""scope for her efforts in freeing the newspaper from editorial biases  have narrowed"". [11]
History
[ edit ]
The Hindu was founded in Madras on 20 September 1878 as a weekly newspaper, by what was known then as the Triplicane Six, which consisted of four law students and two teachers, that is, T. T. Rangacharya, P. V. Rangacharya, D. Kesava Rao Pantulu and N. Subba Rao Pantulu , led by G. Subramania Iyer (a school teacher from Tanjore district ) and M. Veeraraghavacharyar, a lecturer at Pachaiyappa's College. [12]
Kasturi family
[ edit ]
The partnership between Veeraraghavachariar and Subramania Iyer was dissolved in October 1898. Iyer quit the paper and Veeraraghavachariar became the sole owner and appointed C. Karunakara Menon the editor. However, The Hindu's adventurousness began to decline in the 1900s and so did its circulation, which was down to 800 copies when the sole proprietor decided to sell out. The purchaser was The Hindu's Legal Adviser from 1895, S. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar . [13]
Joint managing director N. Murali said in July 2003, ""It is true that our readers have been complaining that some of our reports are partial and lack objectivity. But it also depends on reader beliefs."" [14] N. Ram was appointed on 27 June 2003 as its editor-in-chief with a mandate to ""improve the structures and other mechanisms to uphold and strengthen quality and objectivity in news reports and opinion pieces"", authorised to ""restructure the editorial framework and functions in line with the competitive environment"". [15] On 3 and 23 September 2003, the reader's letters column carried responses from readers saying the editorial was biased. [16] [17] An editorial in August 2003 observed that the newspaper was affected by the 'editorialising as news reporting ' virus, and expressed a determination to buck the trend, restore the professionally sound lines of demarcation, and strengthen objectivity and factuality in its coverage. [18]
In 1987–88, The Hindu's coverage of the Bofors arms deal scandal , a series of document-backed exclusives, set the terms of the national political discourse on this subject. [19] The Bofors scandal broke in April 1987 with Swedish Radio alleging that bribes had been paid to top Indian political leaders, officials and Army officers in return for the Swedish arms manufacturing company winning a hefty contract with the Government of India for the purchase of 155 mm howitzers. During a six-month period, the newspaper published scores of copies of original papers that documented the secret payments, amounting to $50 million, into Swiss bank accounts, the agreements behind the payments, communications relating to the payments and the crisis response, and other material. The investigation was led by a part-time correspondent of The Hindu, Chitra Subramaniam , reporting from Geneva , and was supported by Ram in Chennai. The scandal was a major embarrassment to the party in power at the centre, the Indian National Congress , and its leader Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi . The paper's editorial accused the Prime Minister of being party to massive fraud and cover-up. [20]
In 1991, Deputy Editor N. Ravi, Ram's younger brother, replaced G. Kasturi as editor. Nirmala Lakshman, Kasturi Srinivasan's granddaughter and the first woman in the company to hold an editorial or managerial role, became Joint Editor of The Hindu and her sister, Malini Parthasarathy , Executive Editor. [21]
In 2003, the Jayalalitha government of the state of Tamil Nadu, of which Chennai is the capital, filed cases against The Hindu for breach of privilege of the state legislative body. The move was perceived as a government's assault on freedom of the press. The paper garnered support from the journalistic community. [22]
In 2010, The Indian Express reported a dispute within the publisher of The Hindu regarding the retirement age of the person working as the editor-in-chief, a post which was then being served by N. Ram. Following this report, Ram decided to sue The Indian Express for defamation, a charge which the Indian Express denied. N. Ravi and Parthasarathy voiced concern about Ram's decision, saying that doing so goes against The Hindu's values and that journalists should not fear ""scrutiny"", respectively. [23] During subsequent events, Parthasarathy tweeted that ""issues relating to management of newspaper have come to the surface, including editorial direction"" in her response to a question. Later, Parthasarathy called N. Ram and other The Hindu employees ""Stalinists"", alleging that they were trying to oust her from the newspaper. [24] [21]
In 2011, during the resignation of N. Ram , the newspaper became the subject of a succession battle between the members of the Kasturi family. Ram had appointed Siddharth Varadarajan as his successor as the editor-in-chief of the newspaper who justified the appointment on the ostensible basis of separation of ownership and management, which was opposed by N. Ravi as it deviated from the publication's tradition of family members retaining editorial control over it. [25] Varadarajan was subsequently accused by the dissident family members of being left leaning and the matter of Varadarajan's appointment was brought in front of the board of directors of the parent company, Kasturi & Sons. During the dispute, Narasimhan Murali alleged that N. Ram ran The Hindu ""like a banana republic, with cronyism and vested interests ruling the roost"". In the end the board voted 6–6 over a review of the appointment, the tie was broken by a deciding vote from Ram in his capacity as the chairman of the company and in favor of his decision. [24]
On 2 April 2013 The Hindu started ""The Hindu in School"" with S. Shivakumar as editor. This is a new edition for young readers, to be distributed through schools as part of The Hindu's ""Newspaper in Education"" programme. It covers the day's important news developments, features, sports, and regional news. [26] On 16 September 2013, The Hindu group launched its Tamil edition with K. Ashokan as editor. [27]
On 21 October 2013, changes were made in Editorial as well as business of The Hindu. [28]
During the 2015 South Indian floods , for the first time since its founding in 1878, the newspaper did not publish a print edition in Chennai market on 2 December, as workers were unable to reach the press building. [29]
On 5 January 2016, Parthasarathy resigned with immediate effect. It was reported by the media that she resigned her post, Malini found herself involved in several disputes with the editorial team. In a recent incident, she engaged in a discussion with RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy regarding The Hindu's fact-checking of the ' sengol ' controversy. The newspaper had contradicted the Union government's claim that the 'sengol' was presented to then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru by Lord Mountbatten , the last Viceroy of India. Gurumurthy contested the findings of the fact-checking article. [30] [31] However, she continues to be a Wholetime Director of Kasturi & Sons Ltd. [32] In July 2020, she became the chairperson of the group. On 5 June 2023, she stepped down, upon completion of her non-extendable three-year term as chairperson,  and Nirmala Lakshman was unanimously appointed as chairperson of the group. [10] [33]
Management
[ edit ]
Over the course of its history, the Kasturi Ranga Iyengar family has usually run The Hindu through the presence of family in editorial and business operations as well as on the Board. It was headed by G. Kasturi from 1965 to 1991, N. Ravi from 1991 to 2003, and by his brother, N. Ram, from 27 June 2003 to 18 January 2011. [21]
As of 2010, there are 12 directors in the board of Kasturi & Sons. [34]

Khammam town which was the seat of Taluk Administration was a part of the larger Warangal district, till 1 October 1953. Six taluks of the Warangal district viz., Khammam, Madhira , Yellandu , Paloncha , Kothagudem and Burgampadu were carved out as a new district with Khammam as headquarters. On 1 November 1956, Hyderabad state was dissolved, and Khammam district became part of Andhra Pradesh.
In 1959, Bhadrachalam revenue division consisting of Bhadrachalam and Nuguru Venkatapuram Taluks of East Godavari district , which were on the other side of the river Godavari were merged into Khammam on grounds of geographical contiguity and administrative viability. Aswaraopeta was also part of West Godavari District up to 1959. In 1973 a new taluk with Sathupalli as headquarters was carved out from Madhira and Kothagudem taluks. In the year 1976 three new taluks were formed viz., Tirumalayapalem , Aswaraopeta and Manuguru by bifurcating Khammam, Kothagudem and Burgampadu taluks respectively.
In the year 1985, following the introduction of the mandal system, the district has been divided into 46 mandals, under four Revenue Divisions – Khammam, Kothagudem, Paloncha and Bhadrachalam.
On 2 June 2014, Khammam together with nine other districts became the new state of Telangana , which was separated from Andhra Pradesh. On 11 July 2014, the Lok Sabha approved a bill transferring seven mandals of Khammam district (Kukunoor, Velairpadu, Bhurgampadu, Chintoor, Kunavaram, Vararamachandrapuram and Bhadrachalam) back to Andhra Pradesh, in order to facilitate the Polavaram Irrigation project . [6] [7]
Geography

Large sculptures carved into a material that remain at location
The Lion Monument , an in situ sculpture in Lucerne , Switzerland
A colossal statue is one that is more than twice life-size. [1] This is a list of colossal statues and other sculptures that were created, mostly or all carved, and remain in situ . This list includes two colossal stones that were intended to be moved. However, they were never broken free of the quarry in which they were carved, and therefore they would be considered carved in situ. Most of these were carved in ancient times.
In many cases, especially in India, these sculptures were carved out of softer rocks like sandstone or volcanic tuff . However, in some cases they were carved out of harder rocks like basalt , or even granite in the case of the unfinished obelisk in Egypt. The Egyptians may have been limited to using 4.5-kilogram (10-pound) dolerite balls to chip away at the granite. [2] Dynamite was used in the carving of Mount Rushmore 's Shrine of Democracy, one of the few colossal sculptures that was carved out of granite.

Nelakondapalli
Website
www.khammam.nic.in
Nelakondapally, also referred to as Nelakondapalli or Nela Kondapalli, is a town and headquarters of a mandal in Khammam district , Telangana , India . It is also an archaeological site important to early Buddhism and Hinduism, where excavations have discovered a major stupa site near an ancient manmade lake, another site where Buddhist and Hindu artwork were carved in pre-3rd century India, both sites also yielding hundreds of ancient rare coins with Shaiva and Vaishnava inscriptions from the dynasties of Andhra Ikshvakus and Vishnukundinas . Nelakondapally is also the birthplace of Bhakta Ramadasu . [1]
Location
[ edit ]
Nelakondapalli is located 21 kilometers southwest of Khammam , 58 km east-southeast of Suryapet and close to the Telangana–Andhra Pradesh border. It is connected to the Indian national highway grid with NH365A, the link between Khammam to Kodad and Kusumanchi . Nelakondapalli is not to be confused with Kondapalli, another different ancient town in the Deccan region. Historic Telugu and Sanskrit inscriptions mention Kondapalli, where the context clarifies whether they refer to Nelakondapalli or the other Kondapalli located over a hill and was once a hill-fort. In contrast,Nela means land and Nelakondapalli was linked to major Deccan cities on one of the ancient trade roads connecting north, east and south India. [2]
History
[ edit ]
The Nelakondapalle area was a significant human settlement since at least c. 100 BCE, with early Buddhist presence evidence by a vihara, pottery and coins excavated between 1970 and 1990.
Nelakondapalli was a major town in ancient history. This is evidenced by one of the largest Buddhist stupas discovered in the Deccan (Dakhina, Dakhinapatha) region about 2 kilometers northeast of the contemporary village location, along with Satavahana era sites scattered around the village. Situated midst the farm fields and next to a large ancient manmade lake, this maha-stupa (mahachaitya) is co-located with brick lined vihara complex, wells, cisterns . Near this site, archaeological excavations have also unearthed terracotta figurines, hundreds of coins from early Hindu dynasties, a bronze statue of Buddha and a small model stupa carved in limestone. [1] In addition to Buddhist artwork, inscriptions stones and inscribed articles from 5th to 12th-centuries have been discovered in Nelakondapalli suggesting that the site remained active and historically important to Telugu culture through the Western Chalukya, Eastern Chalukya of Vengi, and Kakatiya eras. [2] Its importance is confirmed by literary references in Telugu and Sanskrit texts as (Nela)kondapalli-300 or Kondapalli-300 Panugallu. Kakatiya era inscriptions state that the local Recherla rulers made gifts to goddess temples here in the 12th century. [2] Another inscription called the Nelakondapalli inscription of Krishnadevaraya is dated to the Vijayanagara Empire era, attesting to Nelakondapalli in the early 16th century. [3]
Most of the historic Buddhist and Hindu structures were missing by the 19th-century, including the Hindu temples mentioned in various inscriptions. A survey commissioned by the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1934 reported scattered temple ruins and a beheaded Nandi in Nelakondapalli. [4] Archaeological excavations began after local farmers reported finding buried reliefs and statues. This initiative began in the 1970s and were completed in stages through the 1990s. [1] [2]
The Nelakondapalli village is the birthplace of Bhakta Ramadasa who helped established the major Rama temple in Bhadrachalam , where textual records refer to Nelankondapally as Bhugiri. [5]
This information plaque describes a Buddhist Stupa excavated by Archeological Survey of India. In Telugu language is a description of Virata Raju Dibba and a location Kichaka Gundam nearby that locals believe are related to events in Mahabharata.
Buddhist archaeological site
[ edit ]
About 2 kilometers northeast of Nelakondapalli village is a large ancient manmade lake. Along it, midst the farms, are three sites locally known as Viratrajgadde, Erradibba and Byragulagutta. In the 1970s, the villagers accidentally stumbled upon portions of limestone panels and broken parts of a Buddha statue. They reported their findings to the state archaeological department – then under Andhra Pradesh, now Telangana. The state archaeology department undertook excavations between 1976 and 1985, over several seasons given the state's budget constraints. [6] These excavations uncovered one of the largest stupas (54 feet high, 84 feet inner diameter, 138 feet outer diameter) with a ring and spoke architecture. The entire site is about 200 meters by 200 meters, incIudes brick lined foundation of east-west and north-south oriented vihara complexes. The unearthed foundation were in two layers, the older layer below the upper layer, likely a repair and reconstruction in a later century. In addition to the foundation, numerous coins, panels, statue parts, figurines, and wares were found in the upper strata from Ikshvaku and Vishnukundin era, similar to those found in many other parts of India. These findings suggest that the Nellakondapalli Buddhist site was likely a monastery on a trade route, likely in existence before the 1st century CE according to some scholars, and active till at least the 4th to 5th century. [1] [6]
One of the inscribed votive stupa discovered during these excavations is dated by Himanshu Prabha Ray between the 3rd to 4th-century CE. [7] According to Ray, the site should be dated to a bit later era based on the epigraphical evidence and the fact that ancient coins tended to remain in circulation for an extended periods of time. The Nelakondapalli site, states Ray, is of historic significance, and was one of many located along the trans-peninsular trade route of ancient Greater India, connecting the Krishna river valley to other parts of the Indian subcontinent. The other sites that traders and monks likely frequented via Nelakondapalli were Kondapur, Dhulikatta on their way to Ter and Paithan. [8]
Satavahana site
[ edit ]
Additional though limited excavations in and around Nelakondapalli has unearthed wares, coins, brick foundations, and similar evidence of a much larger ancient town where Buddhist and Hindu panels and artwork were produced. The discovery of hundreds of Satavahana coins which are commonly found in Deccan sites and of Ikshavaku coins that are rare in Telangana – southwestern parts of Nalgonda district being only other site – attests to Nelakondapallu's importance to the regional trade networks, economy and its ancient prosperity. [1]
Most of the major discoveries from the Nelakondapalli site have been relocated. A few inscribed pillars and broken parts are now in the modern era Hindu temples and a small village library. [1] [9] Larger, more sophisticated, and damaged Buddhist and Hindu statues and artworks from Nelakondapallii were moved to Vijayawada museum and other locations, though since the early 1990s, the regional tourism departments have printed marketing brochures showing Nelakondapalli site with Buddhist and Hindu artifacts. [9]
Temples
There are several Hindu temples in the village, one mosque and one denominational church.

Musunuri Nayakas
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Medieval ruling dynasty in South India
Musunuri dynasty
e
The Musunuri Nayakas were a ruling family of 14th-century South India who were briefly significant in the region of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh . Musunuri Kapaya Nayaka is said to have taken a leadership role among the Andhra chieftains and driven out the Delhi Sultanate from Warangal . But his rise was soon challenged by the Bahmani Sultanate and he was defeated along with the Vijayanagar in the Bahmani–Vijayanagar War . The Recherla Nayakas wrested power from him in 1368. [1]
Origins
Little is known of the Musunuri family; they are often described as ""obscure"". [2] [3] The founding ruler of the family, Musunuri Prolaya Nayaka not to be confused with prolaya vema reddi a contemporary ruler from reddi dynasty, suddenly appears as a new ruler at Rekapalle, near Bhadrachalam , around 1330. [4] Prolaya Nayaka was son of Musunuri Pochaya Nayaka. [5] [6]
Some Andhra historians state that Musunuri Nayakas belonged to the Kamma caste group. [7] [8] However, according to Cynthia Talbot, the modern castes of Andhra region did not originate until the late stages of the Vijayanagara Empire . [9] Musunuri Nayakas were ardent saivities and Kapaya Nayaka acclaimed that he was chosen by none other than the Lord Visweswara of Kashi (i.e. Lord Siva) to protect the Dharma. [10]
Opposition to the Delhi Sultanate's invasion
After the fall of the Kakatiyas, their empire was annexed by the Delhi Sultanate. Ulugh Khan (also known as Muhammad bin Tughluq ), the general that conquered Warangal, renamed it ""Sultanpur"" and remained as the governor of the region for a short period. In 1324, he was recalled to Delhi to succeed the Khaljis as Muhammad bin Tughluq . A former Kakatiya commander, Nagaya Ganna Vibhudu, now renamed Malik Maqbul , was appointed as the governor of the region. [11] However, the Tughluq hold over the erstwhile Kakatiya empire was tenuous and a number of local chieftains seized effective power. [12]
Vilasa grant
Vilasa grant was the only inscription made by Prolaya Nayaka that got discovered. This grant was very crucial for Andhra history gave new insight into the history of Andhra and Telangana, and the happenings aftermath of the death of Kakatiya Prataparudra II. This Vilasa grant was originally discovered in the 19th century but it came to limelight after nearly a century and got deciphered by the eminent Indian historian, Mallampalli Somasekhara Sarma who specialized in the medieval history of Andhra and Telangana. The grant details got published in Volume 32 of the Epigrahia Indica, which mentions that the original discovery happened at Kandarāḍa, a village near the ancient town Pithapuram , Andhra Pradesh , by Hundi Venkata Rao Pantulu and his Vaishya partner. These discovered 14 copper plates were equally distributed and the share of 7 plates held by Venkata Rao Pantulu got preserved and now they are currently located in the Government museum at Chennai . [13] These 7 copper plates are deciphered by Somasekhara Sarma and they reveal about a land grant to Brahmins in Konaseema region nearby a village named Vilasa ( Telugu : విలస),  currently in Ainavilli Mandal of Konaseema district , Andhra Pradesh.
Prolaya Nayaka
Rekapalle
Musunuri Nayakas locations
According to the Vilasa grant, [13] Prolaya Nayaka ruled from Rekapalle located at the edge of the Papikondalu hills (part of the Eastern Ghats ), Rekapalle could control the narrow Sabari river valley lying between the Bhadrachalam forest and the Papikondalu forest. Konda Reddis , who populate the hill forests would have facilitated Prolaya Nayaka's rebellion against the Sultanate. [4] [14] Rekapalle is also a strategic location to control or obstruct communications on the Godavari river passing through the hills.
Prolaya Vema Reddi of the Panta Reddi clan, who seems to have established his own independent rule in Addanki by 1325, is believed to have taken control of the region between the Krishna and Godavari rivers, perhaps up to Rajahmundry . [15] [16] Historian M. Rama Rao states that Prolayavema Reddi and Prolaya Nayaka must have made a 'joint effort' to drive the Muslim rule out from the area. [16]
In 1330, Prolaya Nayaka published the Vilasa grant, a copper-plate grant near Pithapuram , in which he bemoaned the devastation of the Telugu country brought about by northern Muslim armies and attempted to legitimise himself as the rightful restorer of order. [17] Prolaya Nayaka left no children and was succeeded by a cousin, Kapaya Nayaka, who governed until 1368 and attempted to further expand his rule.
Kapaya Nayaka
Rebellion
Musunuri Kapaya Nayaka
Kapaya Nayaka ( r. 1333–1368) led a larger rebellion against the Tughluq rule, driving it out of Warangal in 1336. According to the Kaluvacheru grant of Anithalli, a female member of the Panta Reddi clan in 1423, Kapaya Nayaka was assisted by 75 Nayakas. The grant also states that Prolaya Vema Reddi was one among these 75 Nayakas. [18] [a]
Muhammad bin Tughluq, who became the Sultan of Delhi in 1324, witnessed numerous rebellions starting in 1330, first in the immediate vicinity in the Ganga-Yamuna doab, which caused a famine in Delhi, and rebellions within ranks in Ma'bar ( Madurai ) and Bengal. It is possible that Kapaya Nayaka advanced in the direction of Warangal in this period, acquiring some of its territory. Consequently, Telangana was also counted among the rebellious territories. [21] In 1334–35, the Sultan marched on Deccan in an attempt to quell the rebellions, but his army was struck by some kind of epidemic and the Sultan himself fell gravely ill. He was forced to retreat to Delhi via Daulatabad. It is said that about a third of his army perished due to the epidemic. [22]
Ferishta narrates that, around this time, Kapaya Nayaka approached the Hoysala ruler Veera Ballala III for assistance in evicting the Sultanate from Warangal. After consideration, assistance was offered.
Bilal Dew [Ballala], convened a meeting of his kinsmen and resolved, first, to secure the forts of his own country. and then to remove his seat of government among the mountains. Krishn Naig [Kapaya Nayak] promised, on his part also, that when their plans were ripe for execution, to raise all the Hindoos of Wurungole and Telingana and put himself at their head.... He (Bilal Dew) then raised an army and put part of it under the command of Krishn Naig, who reduced Wurungole and compelled Imad-ool-Moolk, the governor, to retreat to Dowlatabad [Daulatabad].
Ferishta , Tarikh-i-farishti ( c. 1600) [23]
Historian R. C. Majumdar characterizes it as a 'national revolt' backed up by a regular army. Governor Malik Maqbul found himself unable to withstand the rebellion and fled to Delhi. [24] [25] Ferishta states that Kapaya Nayaka and Ballala III then jointly marched on the newly declared Madurai Sultanate and divested it of its outlying territories, in particular Tondaimandalam . [23] [24]
The family tree of Musunuri Nayakas as mentioned in Vuppuluri Ganapathi Sastry 's Vedasāraratnāvaḷi, a two part treatise on the essence of Vedas that was written for the Endowments Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh . [26] These details matches with near accuracy with mentions in Indian Epigraphic reports. [5]
Rule
Kapaya Nayaka took control of Warangal from Malik Maqbul in 1336 and thus also of a wider swathe of eastern Telangana that was governed from there. He also tried to support other rebels in the surrounding areas, although in the case of aid given to Alauddin Bahman Shah , the outcome was that his fellow rebel turned on him. Several military engagements with Bahman Shah followed over a period of years, during which Kapaya Nayaka had to cede various forts and territories, including Golconda (near modern Hyderabad). His weakened position was exploited by the Reddis of Kondavidu and the Recherla Nayakas , the latter of whom killed him in battle at Bhimavaram near Warangal in 1368. [1] [27] [28] [b]
Despite his supposed opposition to the Dehlavi Sultans, Kapaya Nayaka continued using the Kush Mahal built by the Sultans in Warangal and adopted the Persianised title ""Sultan of the Andhra country"" (Āndhra Suratrāṇa). In 1361, he gifted to the Bahmani Sultan Mohammed Shah I the Turquoise throne of Warangal, made during the Delhi rule, as part of a treaty agreement. [29]
After the death of Kapaya Nayaka, his allied Nayakas are said to have returned to their own towns, and the period of the Musunuri family ended. The Recherla Nayakas became the dominant power in the Telangana that lasted till 1435. [30]

The predominantly tribal region around the town of Asifabad was ruled by many dynasties like the Kakatiyas , Mauryas , Satavahanas , Chalukyas , Qutub Shahis , Asaf Jahis and Gonds . In the early 20th century, the district was known as Jangam and Asifabad served as its headquarters. In 1905, the district was merged into the neighbouring Adilabad district . In 1913, Asifabad was made as headquarters of the district prior to the status being lost to Adilabad town in 1941. Following the creation of Telangana state, the districts were re-organized in 2016. As a result, Asifabad district was again carved from Adilabad district and was renamed after the Gond martyr Komaram Bheem . [2] [4]

Seat of the Nizam of Hyderabad
Restored
Azmet Jah
Chowmahalla Palace or Chowmahallat is the palace of the Nizams of Hyderabad State located in Hyderabad , Telangana , India . [1] It was the seat of power of the Asaf Jahi dynasty (1720-1948) and was the official residence of the Nizams during their reign. The palace has been converted into a museum and the ownership still lies with the family. [2] [3]
The palace was constructed at the location of an earlier palace of the Qutb Shahi Dynasty and Asaf Jahi Dynasty [3] close to the Charminar . Construction of the palace, as it stands today, was started by Nizam Ali Khan Asaf Jah II [4] in 1769. He ordered the building of four palaces from which the nomenclature of Chau Mahalla is derived. [5] The word chār or chahār, and its variation chow, means ""four"" and the word mahal means ""palace"" in Urdu , Hindi and Persian . [6]
History

While Salabat Jung initiated its construction in 1750, the palace was completed by the period of Afzal ad-Dawlah, Asaf Jah V between 1857 and 1869. [7] [8]
The palace is unique for its style and elegance. Construction began in the late 18th century and over the decades a synthesis of many architectural styles and influences emerged. The palace consists of two courtyards as well as the grand Khilwat (the Darbar Hall), fountains and gardens . [9] The palace originally covered 45 acres (180,000 m2), but only 12 acres (49,000 m2) remain today. [10]

This is the oldest part of the palace, consisting of four palaces Afzal Mahal, Mahtab Mahal, Tahniyat Mahal and Aftab Maha built symmetrically opposite each other in Neoclassical style. The forecourt in-between the palaces is adorned with a pond and a beautiful garden. [2] [3]
The neoclassical palaces have double-height verandahs or façades lined with European style columns. The columns in the Aftab Mahal and Mehtab Mahal are of Ionic order whereas the Afzal Mahal and Tehniyat Mahal have Corinthian columns. [3]
Northern courtyard
[ edit ]
This part has Bara Imam, a long corridor of rooms on the east side facing the central fountain and pool that once housed the administrative wing and Shishe-Alat, meaning mirror image.
It has Mughal domes and arches and many Persian elements such as the ornate stucco works that adorns the Khilwat Mubarak. These were characteristic of buildings built in Hyderabad at the time.
Opposite the Bara Imam is a building that is its shishe or mirror image. The rooms were once used as guest rooms for officials accompanying visiting dignitaries.
Khilwat Mubarak
[ edit ]
This is heart of Chowmahalla Palace. It is held in high esteem by the people of Hyderabad, as it was the seat of the Asaf Jahi dynasty . The grand pillared Durbar Hall has a pure marble platform on which the Takht-e-Nishan or the royal seat was laid. Here the Nizams held their durbar and other religious and symbolic ceremonies. [11] The 19 spectacular Chandeliers of Belgian crystal were recently reinstalled to recreate the lost splendour of this regal hall. [2]
Clock Tower
[ edit ]
The main gateway to the Chowmahalla Palace on the western hand has a clock tower also known as a Khilafat clock. The tower is three storeys high and consists of balconies and jharokha of Mughal style same as the style of half domes. [11] It has been ticking since 1750. An expert family of horologists winds the mechanical clock every week. [12]
Council Hall
[ edit ]
This building housed a rare collection of manuscripts and priceless books. The Nizam often met important officials and dignitaries here. Today it is a venue for temporary exhibitions from the treasures of the Chowmahalla Palace Collection of the bygone era.[ citation needed ]
Roshan Bangla
[ edit ]
The Sixth Nizam, Mir Mahbub Ali Khan , is believed to have lived here and the building was named after his mother Roshan Begum.
The former Nizam ( Barkat Ali Khan Mukarram Jah ) and his family decided to restore the Chowmahalla Palace and open it to the public in January 2005. It took over 5 years to document and restore the palaces of the first courtyard to its former glory. The palace also has a collection of vintage cars, including the Rolls-Royce , which the Nizam Kings used. [2]
Museum
The displays in the museum depict the origin and evolution of Hyderabad, achievements and valuable contribution of the Nizams towards the development of the state , and the  social lifestyle of the royal family.
The museum is divided into parts arranged around two quadrangle courtyards in North and South.[ citation needed ]

Conservation works were initiated in Chowmahalla Palace from 2000, where several conservation architects and experts were involved in more than a decade long journey. [13] The initiative was undertaken by Princess Esra Birgen . Before commencement of the works, the place had fallen into disuse for a prolonged period and had deteriorated over the time. The vision for the restoration project was to rescue the exemplary palatial complex and to establish a contemporary civic use as a museum showcasing the splendour and valour of the erstwhile Nizams. [14]
The restoration process was divided into three stages, first stage involved thorough mapping, a fabric survey, and the development of conservation plans for the buildings' restoration as well as alternative re-use scenarios that might help assess the practicality of these historic buildings. In the second stage, structures that were in danger of collapsing had to be stabilised, and other urgent repairs like waterproofing and propping had to be made to prevent further damage. The complex's physical restoration as well as the addition of amenities to encourage the reuse of these structures were part of the final phase. [15]
In order to preserve the integrity of these ancient structures, their conservation was carried out using traditional craftsmen and techniques, and several building components were saved from demolition.  Many architectural features, including granite arches, elaborate lime plaster work, and terracotta balusters, were restored carefully in their original design in addition to structural repairs and stabilisation. [15] Apart from bringing back the past glory of the palace complex and reviving traditional materials and craftsmanship,  the project also created a cultural oasis in the heart of the city. [14]
The project was awarded the UNESCO Asia Pacific Merit award for cultural heritage conservation on 15 March 2010. [2] [14] UNESCO representative Takahiko Makino formally handed over the plaque and certificate to Princess Esra, former wife and GPA holder of Prince Mukarram Jah Bahadur. [16] [17]

Pronunciation

Dark blue - Telugu is spoken by a majority.Light blue - Telugu is spoken by a significant minority.
Telugu ( /ˈtɛlʊɡuː/ ; [6]
తెలుగు,
Telugu pronunciation: [ˈt̪eluɡu] ) is a classical Dravidian language native to the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana , where it is also the official language . Spoken by about 96 million people (2022), [7] Telugu is the most widely spoken member of the Dravidian language family, and one of the twenty-two scheduled languages of the Republic of India . [8] It is one of the few languages that has primary official status in more than one Indian state , alongside Hindi and Bengali . [9] Telugu is one of the languages designated as a classical language by the Government of India . It is the 14th most spoken native language in the world. [10] Modern Standard Telugu is based on the dialect of erstwhile Krishna, Guntur, East Godavari and West Godavari districts of Coastal Andhra . [14]
Telugu is also spoken in the states of Karnataka , Tamil Nadu , Maharashtra , Chhattisgarh , Orissa and the union territories of Puducherry and Andaman and Nicobar Islands . It is also spoken by members of the Telugu diaspora spread across countries like United States , Australia , Malaysia , Mauritius , UAE , Saudi Arabia and others. [15] [16] Telugu is the fastest-growing language in the United States. [17] It is also a protected language in South Africa and is offered as an optional third language in schools in KwaZulu-Natal province. [18]
According to Mikhail S. Andronov, Telugu split from the Proto-Dravidian language around 1000 BCE. [19] [20] The earliest Telugu words appear in Prakrit inscriptions dating to c. 4th century BCE, found in Bhattiprolu , Andhra Pradesh. [21] [22] Telugu label inscriptions and Prakrit inscriptions containing Telugu words have been dated to the era of Emperor Ashoka (257 BCE), as well as to the Satavahana and Vishnukundina periods. [23] [24] Inscriptions in Old Telugu script were found as far away as Indonesia and Myanmar . [25] Telugu has been in use as an official language for over 1,400 years [26] and has served as the court language for numerous dynasties in Southern and Eastern India, including the Eastern Chalukyas , Eastern Gangas , Kakatiyas , Vijayanagara Empire , Qutb Shahis , Madurai Nayaks , and Thanjavur Nayaks . [31] It was also used as an official language outside its homeland, even by non-Telugu dynasties such as the Thanjavur Marathas in Tamil Nadu. [32]
Telugu has an unbroken, prolific, and diverse literary tradition of over a thousand years. [33] [34] Pavuluri Mallana 's Sāra Sangraha Ganitamu ( c. 11th century) is the first scientific treatise on mathematics in any Dravidian language. [35] [36] Avadhānaṃ , a literary performance that requires immense memory power and an in-depth knowledge of literature and prosody , originated and was specially cultivated among Telugu poets for over five centuries. [37] [38] Roughly 10,000 pre-colonial inscriptions exist in Telugu. [39]
In the precolonial era, Telugu became the language of high culture throughout South India . [43] Vijaya Ramaswamy compared it to the overwhelming dominance of French as the cultural language of Europe during roughly the same era. [42] Telugu also predominates in the evolution of Carnatic music , one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music and is widely taught in music colleges focusing on Carnatic tradition. [46] Over the centuries, many non-Telugu speakers have praised the natural musicality of Telugu speech, referring to it as a mellifluous and euphonious language. [47] [48]
Person
Locations of Trilinga Kshetras
Speakers of Telugu refer to it as simply Telugu or Telugoo. [49] Older forms of the name include Teluṅgu and Tenuṅgu. [50] Tenugu is derived from the Proto-Dravidian word *ten (""south"") [51] to mean ""the people who lived in the south/southern direction"" (relative to Sanskrit and Prakrit -speaking peoples). The name Telugu, then, is a result of an ""n"" to ""l"" alternation established in Telugu. [52] [53]
The popular belief holds that Telugu is derived from Trilinga of Trilinga Kshetras being the land bounded by the three Lingas which is Telugu homeland. P. Chenchiah and Bhujanga Rao note that Atharvana Acharya in the 13th century wrote a grammar of Telugu, calling it the Trilinga Śabdānusāsana (or Trilinga Grammar). [54] However, most scholars note that Atharvana's grammar was titled Atharvana Karikavali. [59] Appa Kavi in the 17th century explicitly wrote that Telugu was derived from Trilinga. Scholar C. P. Brown made a comment that it was a ""strange notion"" since the predecessors of Appa Kavi had no knowledge of such a derivation. [60]
George Abraham Grierson and other linguists doubt this derivation, holding rather that Telugu was the older term and Trilinga must be the later Sanskritisation of it. [61] [62] If so the derivation itself must have been quite ancient because Triglyphum, Trilingum and Modogalingam are attested in ancient Greek sources, the last of which can be interpreted as a Telugu rendition of ""Trilinga"". [63]
History
Telugu, as a Dravidian language, descends from Proto-Dravidian , a proto-language . Linguistic reconstruction suggests that Proto-Dravidian was spoken around the fourth millennium BCE. [64] [65] Comparative linguistics confirms that Telugu belongs to the South Dravidian-II (also called South-Central Dravidian) sub-group, which also includes the non-literary languages like Gondi , Kuvi , Koya , Pengo , Konda and Manda. [66]
Proto-Telugu is the reconstructed linguistic ancestor of all the dialects and registers of Telugu. [67] Russian linguist Mikhail S. Andronov, places the split of Telugu at c. 1000 BCE. [68]
The linguistic history of Telugu is periodised as follows: [19] [69]
Pre-historic Telugu ( c. 600 BCE–200 BCE)
Old Telugu (200 BCE–1000 CE)
Middle Telugu (1000 CE–1600 CE)
Modern Telugu (1600 CE–present)
Pre-historic Telugu (c. 600 BCE – 200 BCE)
Pre-historic Telugu is identified with the period around 600 BCE or even earlier. [70] [71] Pre-historic Telugu is considered one of the most conservative languages of the Dravidian family based on its linguistic features. [72] [73]
Plural Markers: One notable feature is the presence of contrast in plural markers, such as -ḷ and -nkkVḷ (a combination of -nkk and -Vḷ), which was lost in the earliest forms of many other Dravidian languages. [74] Examples include pū-ḷ (flowers), ā-ḷ (cows), distinct from kolan-kuḷ (tanks), and ī-gaḷ (houseflies).
Nominative Markers: The nominative markers were -nḏu (masc.sg.p1) and -aṁbu (inanimate.sg), which continued to appear in early inscriptions. [75]
Personal Pronouns: Reconstructed personal pronouns include ñān (I) with the oblique form ñā, and ñām or ēm (we). [76]
Phonemic Retention: The early language displayed high phonemic retention, with characteristic phonemes like the voiced retroflex approximant (ḻ or /ɻ/) and the voiced alveolar plosive (ḏ or /d/), which evolved into the alveolar trill (ṟ or /r/) in different positions. Both /d/ and /r/ are evidenced as distinct phonemes in early epigraphic records. [77] [78]
Tenses: Tenses were structured as ""past vs non-past,"" and gender was categorized as ""masculine vs non-masculine."" [79]
Demonstratives: Three demonstratives were in use: ā (distant 'that'), ī (proximate 'this'), and ū (intermediate 'yonder'; in Classical Telugu, ulla). [80]
Non-Palatalized Initials: Non-palatalized initials are identified in words like kēsiri (""they did""), found in inscriptions up until the 8th century CE. [81]
Word Endings: Words typically ended in vowels, though some had consonant endings with sonorants like -y, -r, -m, -n, -l, -ḷ, -ḻ, and -w. Classical Telugu developed an epenthetic -u that vowelized the final consonant, a feature that has been partly retained in Modern Telugu.
Place Name Suffixes: Archaic place name suffixes include -puḻōl, -ūr, -paḷḷiya, -pāḷiyam, -paṟṟu, -konḏa, -pūṇḍi, -paṭṭaṇa(ṁbu), pāḻu, paṟiti, and pāka(m). [77]
Apical Displacement: Apical displacement was underway for certain words. [82]
Conjunctive Marker: The conjunctive marker -um had various structural applications. [83]
Earliest records
One of the earliest Telugu words, nágabu, found at the Amaravati Stupa , is dated to around 200 BCE. [84] This word was further analyzed by Iravatham Mahadevan in his attempts to decipher the Indus script . [85] Several Telugu words, primarily personal and place names, were identified at Amaravati , Nagarjunakonda , Krishna river basin , Ballari , Eluru , Ongole and Nellore between 200 BCE and 500 CE. [86]
The Ghantasala Brahmin inscription [87] and the pillar inscription of Vijaya Satakarni at Vijayapuri, Nagarjunakonda , and other locations date to the first century CE. [23] [88] Additionally, the Tummalagudem inscription of the Vishnukundinas dates to the 5th century CE. [89] [23] Telugu place names in Prakrit inscriptions are attested from the 2nd century CE onwards. [90] [91]
A number of Telugu words were found in the Sanskrit and Prakrit inscriptions of the Satavahana dynasty , Vishnukundina dynasty , and Andhra Ikshvakus . [23] The coin legends of the Satavahanas, in all areas and all periods, used a Prakrit dialect without exception. Some reverse coin legends are in Telugu [24] [92] and Tamil languages. [93]

Post-Ikshvaku period
Main article: Early Telugu epigraphy
The period from the 4th century CE to 1022 CE marks the second phase of Telugu history, following the Andhra Ikshvaku period. The first long inscription entirely in Telugu, dated to 575 CE, is attributed to the Renati Choda king Dhanunjaya and found in the Kadapa district . [90] [94] [26]
An early Telugu label inscription, ""tolacuwānḍru"" (తొలచువాండ్రు; transl. rock carvers or quarrymen), is found on one of the rock-cut caves around the Keesaragutta temple , 35 kilometers from Hyderabad . [95] [96] This inscription is dated to the Vishnukundina period of around 400 CE [97] [98] and is the earliest known short Telugu inscription from the Telangana region. [98]
Several titles of Mahendravarman I in Telugu language, dated to c. 600 CE, were inscribed on cave-inscriptions in Tamil Nadu. [99]
From the 6th century onwards, complete Telugu inscriptions began to appear in districts neighbouring Kadapa such as Prakasam and Palnadu . [100] : 10 Metrically composed Telugu inscriptions and those with ornamental or literary prose appear from 630 CE. [101] [102] The Madras Museum plates of Balliya-Choda dated to the mid-ninth century CE, are the earliest copper plate grants in the Telugu language. [103]
During this period, Telugu was heavily influenced by Sanskrit and Prakrit, corresponding to the advent of Telugu literature. Initially, Telugu literature appeared in inscriptions and poetry in the courts of rulers, and later in written works, such as Nannayya 's Andhra Mahabharatam (1022 CE). [104]
Middle Ages
The third phase is marked by further stylisation and sophistication of the literary languages. During this period the split of the Telugu from the Telugu-Kannada alphabet took place. [105]
Vijayanagara Empire
The Vijayanagara Empire gained dominance from 1336 to the late 17th century, reaching its peak during the rule of Krishnadevaraya in the 16th century, when Telugu literature experienced what is considered its Golden Age . [104] The 15th-century Venetian explorer Niccolò de' Conti , who visited the Vijayanagara Empire , found that the words in the Telugu language end with vowels, just like those in Italian , and hence referred to it as ""The Italian of the East""; [106] a saying that has been widely repeated. [107]
Delhi Sultanate, Qutb Shahi, and Nizam era
A distinct dialect developed in present-day Hyderabad region, due to Persian and Arabic influence. This influence began with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate rule by the Tughlaq dynasty in the northern Deccan Plateau during the 14th century.
In the latter half of the 17th century, the Mughal Empire extended further south, culminating in the establishment of the Hyderabad State by the dynasty of the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1724. This heralded an era of Persian influence on the Telugu language, especially Hyderabad State. The effect is also evident in the prose of the early 19th century, as in the kaifiyats . [104]
Colonial period
In the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, the influence of the English language was seen, and modern communication/printing press arose as an effect of British rule , especially in the areas that were part of the Madras Presidency . Literature from this time had a mix of classical and modern traditions and included works by such scholars as Gidugu Venkata Ramamoorty , Kandukuri Veeresalingam , Gurajada Apparao , Gidugu Sitapati and Panuganti Lakshminarasimha Rao . [104]
In the princely Hyderabad State , the Andhra Mahasabha was started in 1921 with the main goal of promoting Telugu language, literature, its books and historical research. Key figures in this movement included Madapati Hanumantha Rao (founder of the Andhra Mahasabha), Komarraju Venkata Lakshmana Rao (founder of the Library Movement in Hyderabad State), and Suravaram Pratapa Reddy . [108]
Since the 1930s, what was considered an ""elite"" literary form of the Telugu language has now spread to the common people with the introduction of mass media like movies, television, radio and newspapers. This form of the language is also taught in schools and colleges as a standard. [109]
Post-independence period
Telugu is one of the 22 languages with official status in India . [110] The Andhra Pradesh Official Language Act, 1966, declares Telugu the official language of the state that is currently divided into Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. [111] [112] It also has official language status in the Yanam district of the union territory of Puducherry . It is the fourth most spoken Indian language in India after Hindi , Bengali and Marathi . [113] It is one of the six classical languages of India . [114] [115]
Telugu Language Day is celebrated every year on 29 August, the birthday of Telugu poet Gidugu Venkata Ramamurthy . [116] [117] The fourth World Telugu Conference was organised in Tirupati in the last week of December 2012. Issues related to Telugu language policy were deliberated at length. [118] [119] The American Community Survey has said that data for 2016 which were released in September 2017 showed Telugu is the third most widely spoken Indian language in the US. Hindi tops the list followed by Gujarati, as of the 2010 census . [120] [121]
In the Indian subcontinent, a command over the Telugu language, alongside Sanskrit , Tamil , Meitei , Oriya , Persian , or Arabic , is highly appreciated and respected for learning dances (most significantly Indian Classical Dances ) as dancers could have the tools of these languages to go into the primary material texts.

According to the Constitution of South Africa , the Pan South African Language Board must promote and ensure respect for Telugu along with other languages. [129] The Government of South Africa announced that Telugu will be re-included as an official subject in the South African schools after it was removed from the curriculum in state schools. [130]
In addition, with the creation in October 2004 of a legal status for classical languages by the Government of India on 8 August 2008, Telugu was also given classical language status due to several campaigns. [131] [23] [132]
Epigraphical records
Main article: Early Telugu epigraphy
According to the famous Japanese historian Noboru Karashima who served as the president of the Epigraphical Society of India in 1985, there are approximately 10,000 inscriptions which exist in the Telugu language as of the year 1996 making it one of the most densely inscribed languages. [39] Telugu inscriptions are found in all the districts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. [135] They are also found in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh. [139] According to recent estimates by ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) the number of inscriptions in the Telugu language goes up to 14,000. [100] [140] Adilabad, Medak, Karimnagar, Nizamabad, Ranga Reddy, Hyderabad, Mahbubnagar, Anantapur, Chittoor and Srikakulam produced only a handful of Telugu inscriptions in the Kakatiya era between 1135 CE and 1324 CE. [141] [142]
Geographical influence
Telugu region boundaries
Andhra is characterised as having its own mother tongue, and its territory has been equated with the extent of the Telugu language. The equivalence between the Telugu linguistic sphere and the geographical boundaries of Andhra is also brought out in an eleventh-century description of Andhra boundaries. Andhra, according to this text, was bounded in north by Mahendra mountain in the modern Ganjam district in Odisha and to the south by Srikalahasteeswara temple in Tirupati district . [143] However, Andhra extended westwards as far as Srisailam in Nandyal district , about halfway across the modern state. [144] According to other sources in the early sixteenth century, the northern boundary is Simhachalam and the southern limit is Tirumala of the Telugu ation. [145] [146] [147] [148] [149] [150]

The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state with the aim of enforcing the law and protecting the public order as well as the public itself. [1] This commonly includes ensuring the safety , health , and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder . [2] [3] Their lawful powers encompass arrest and the use of force legitimized by the state via the monopoly on violence . The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. [4] Police forces are usually public sector services, funded through taxes.
Law enforcement is only part of policing activity. [5] Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. [6] In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . [7] Police forces have become ubiquitous and a necessity in complex modern societies. However, their role can sometimes be controversial, as they may be involved to varying degrees in corruption , brutality , and the enforcement of authoritarian rule .
A police force may also be referred to as a police department, police service, constabulary , gendarmerie , crime prevention , protective services, law enforcement agency , civil guard, or civic guard. Members may be referred to as police officers , troopers , sheriffs , constables , rangers , peace officers or civic/civil guards. Ireland differs from other English-speaking countries by using the Irish language terms Garda (singular) and Gardaí (plural), for both the national police force and its members. The word police is the most universal and similar terms can be seen in many non-English speaking countries. [8]
Numerous slang terms exist for the police. Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with lost etymologies. One of the oldest, cop, has largely lost its slang connotations and become a common colloquial term used both by the public and police officers to refer to their profession. [9]
Etymology
First attested in English in the early 15th century, originally in a range of senses encompassing '(public) policy; state; public order', the word police comes from Middle French police ('public order, administration, government'), [10] in turn from Latin politia, [11] which is the romanization of the Ancient Greek πολιτεία (politeia) 'citizenship, administration, civil polity'. [12] This is derived from πόλις ( polis ) 'city'. [13]
History
Ancient
China
Law enforcement in ancient China was carried out by ""prefects"" for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period . In Jin, dozens of prefects were spread across the state, each having limited authority and employment period. They were appointed by local magistrates, who reported to higher authorities such as governors, who in turn were appointed by the emperor, and they oversaw the civil administration of their ""prefecture"", or jurisdiction. Under each prefect were ""subprefects"" who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area. Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations, much like modern police detectives. Prefects could also be women. [14] Local citizens could report minor judicial offenses against them such as robberies at a local prefectural office. The concept of the ""prefecture system"" spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan.
Babylonia
In Babylonia , law enforcement tasks were initially entrusted to individuals with military backgrounds or imperial magnates during the Old Babylonian period, but eventually, law enforcement was delegated to officers known as paqūdus, who were present in both cities and rural settlements. A paqūdu was responsible for investigating petty crimes and carrying out arrests. [15] [16]
Egypt
In ancient Egypt evidence of law enforcement exists as far back as the Old Kingdom period . There are records of an office known as ""Judge Commandant of the Police"" dating to the fourth dynasty . [17] During the fifth dynasty at the end of the Old Kingdom period, warriors armed with wooden sticks were tasked with guarding public places such as markets, temples, and parks, and apprehending criminals. They are known to have made use of trained monkeys, baboons, and dogs in guard duties and catching criminals. After the Old Kingdom collapsed, ushering in the First Intermediate Period , it is thought that the same model applied. During this period, Bedouins were hired to guard the borders and protect trade caravans. During the Middle Kingdom period, a professional police force was created with a specific focus on enforcing the law, as opposed to the previous informal arrangement of using warriors as police. The police force was further reformed during the New Kingdom period. Police officers served as interrogators, prosecutors, and court bailiffs, and were responsible for administering punishments handed down by judges. In addition, there were special units of police officers trained as priests who were responsible for guarding temples and tombs and preventing inappropriate behavior at festivals or improper observation of religious rites during services. Other police units were tasked with guarding caravans, guarding border crossings, protecting royal necropolises , guarding slaves at work or during transport, patrolling the Nile River , and guarding administrative buildings. By the Eighteenth Dynasty of the New Kingdom period, an elite desert-ranger police force called the Medjay was used to protect valuable areas, especially areas of pharaonic interest like capital cities, royal cemeteries, and the borders of Egypt. Though they are best known for their protection of the royal palaces and tombs in Thebes and the surrounding areas, the Medjay were used throughout Upper and Lower Egypt . Each regional unit had its own captain. The police forces of ancient Egypt did not guard rural communities, which often took care of their own judicial problems by appealing to village elders, but many of them had a constable to enforce state laws. [18] [19]
Greece
In ancient Greece , publicly owned slaves were used by magistrates as police. In Athens , the Scythian Archers (the ῥαβδοῦχοι 'rod-bearers'), a group of about 300 Scythian slaves, was used to guard public meetings to keep order and for crowd control , and also assisted with dealing with criminals, handling prisoners, and making arrests. Other duties associated with modern policing, such as investigating crimes, were left to the citizens themselves. [20] Athenian police forces were supervised by the Areopagus . In Sparta , the Ephors were in charge of maintaining public order as judges, and they used Sparta's Hippeis , a 300-member Royal guard of honor, as their enforcers. There were separate authorities supervising women, children, and agricultural issues. Sparta also had a secret police force called the crypteia to watch the large population of helots , or slaves. [21] [22]
Rome
In the Roman Empire , the army played a major role in providing security. Roman soldiers detached from their legions and posted among civilians carried out law enforcement tasks. [23] The Praetorian Guard , an elite army unit which was primarily an Imperial bodyguard and intelligence-gathering unit, could also act as a riot police force if required. Local watchmen were hired by cities to provide some extra security. Lictors , civil servants whose primary duty was to act as bodyguards to magistrates who held imperium , could carry out arrests and inflict punishments at their magistrate's command.  Magistrates such as tresviri capitales , procurators fiscal and quaestors investigated crimes. There was no concept of public prosecution, so victims of crime or their families had to organize and manage the prosecution themselves. Under the reign of Augustus , when the capital had grown to almost one million inhabitants, 14 wards were created; the wards were protected by seven squads of 1,000 men called vigiles , who acted as night watchmen and firemen. In addition to firefighting, their duties included apprehending petty criminals, capturing runaway slaves, guarding the baths at night, and stopping disturbances of the peace. As well as the city of Rome, vigiles were also stationed in the harbor cities of Ostia and Portus . Augustus also formed the Urban Cohorts to deal with gangs and civil disturbances in the city of Rome, and as a counterbalance to the Praetorian Guard's enormous power in the city. They were led by the urban prefect . Urban Cohort units were later formed in Roman Carthage and Lugdunum .
India
Law enforcement systems existed in the various kingdoms and empires of ancient India . The Apastamba Dharmasutra prescribes that kings should appoint officers and subordinates in the towns and villages to protect their subjects from crime. Various inscriptions and literature from ancient India suggest that a variety of roles existed for law enforcement officials such as those of a constable, thief catcher, watchman, and detective. [24] In ancient India up to medieval and early modern times, kotwals were in charge of local law enforcement. [25]
Achaemenid (First Persian) Empire
The Achaemenid Empire had well-organized police forces. A police force existed in every place of importance. In the cities, each ward was under the command of a Superintendent of Police, known as a Kuipan. Police officers also acted as prosecutors and carried out punishments imposed by the courts. They were required to know the court procedure for prosecuting cases and advancing accusations. [26]
Israel
In ancient Israel and Judah , officials with the responsibility of making declarations to the people, guarding the king's person, supervising public works, and executing the orders of the courts existed in the urban areas. They are repeatedly mentioned in the Hebrew Bible , and this system lasted into the period of Roman rule. The first century Jewish historian Josephus related that every judge had two such officers under his command. Levites were preferred for this role. Cities and towns also had night watchmen. Besides officers of the town, there were officers for every tribe. The temple in Jerusalem had special temple police to guard it. The Talmud mentions various local police officials in the Jewish communities of the Land of Israel and Babylon who supervised economic activity. Their Greek-sounding titles suggest that the roles were introduced under Hellenic influence. Most of these officials received their authority from local courts and their salaries were drawn from the town treasury. The Talmud also mentions city watchmen and mounted and armed watchmen in the suburbs. [27]
Africa
In many regions of pre-colonial Africa , particularly West and Central Africa, guild-like secret societies emerged as law enforcement. In the absence of a court system or written legal code, they carried out police-like activities, employing varying degrees of coercion to enforce conformity and deter antisocial behavior. [28] In ancient Ethiopia , armed retainers of the nobility enforced law in the countryside according to the will of their leaders. The Songhai Empire had officials known as assara-munidios, or ""enforcers"", acting as police. [29]
The Americas
Pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas also had organized law enforcement. The city-states of the Maya civilization had constables known as tupils. [30] In the Aztec Empire , judges had officers serving under them who were empowered to perform arrests, even of dignitaries. [31] In the Inca Empire , officials called curaca enforced the law among the households they were assigned to oversee, with inspectors known as tokoyrikoq ( lit. 'he who sees all') also stationed throughout the provinces to keep order. [32] [33]
Post-classical
The Santas Hermandades of medieval Spain were formed to protect pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago .
In medieval Spain , Santas Hermandades , or 'holy brotherhoods', peacekeeping associations of armed individuals, were a characteristic of municipal life, especially in Castile . As medieval Spanish kings often could not offer adequate protection, protective municipal leagues began to emerge in the twelfth century against banditry and other rural criminals, and against the lawless nobility or to support one or another claimant to a crown.
These organizations were intended to be temporary, but became a long-standing fixture of Spain. The first recorded case of the formation of an hermandad occurred when the towns and the peasantry of the north united to police the pilgrim road to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia , and protect the pilgrims against robber knights.
Throughout the Middle Ages such alliances were frequently formed by combinations of towns to protect the roads connecting them, and were occasionally extended to political purposes. Among the most powerful was the league of North Castilian and Basque ports, the Hermandad de las marismas: Toledo , Talavera , and Villarreal .
As one of their first acts after end of the War of the Castilian Succession in 1479, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile established the centrally-organized and efficient Holy Brotherhood as a national police force. They adapted an existing brotherhood to the purpose of a general police acting under officials appointed by themselves, and endowed with great powers of summary jurisdiction even in capital cases. The original brotherhoods continued to serve as modest local police-units until their final suppression in 1835.
The Vehmic courts of Germany provided some policing in the absence of strong state institutions. Such courts had a chairman who presided over a session and lay judges who passed judgement and carried out law enforcement tasks. Among the responsibilities that lay judges had were giving formal warnings to known troublemakers, issuing warrants, and carrying out executions.
In the medieval Islamic Caliphates , police were known as Shurta . Bodies termed Shurta existed perhaps as early as the Caliphate of Uthman . The Shurta is known to have existed in the Abbasid and Umayyad Caliphates . Their primary roles were to act as police and internal security forces but they could also be used for other duties such as customs and tax enforcement, rubbish collection, and acting as bodyguards for governors. From the 10th century, the importance of the Shurta declined as the army assumed internal security tasks while cities became more autonomous and handled their own policing needs locally, such as by hiring watchmen. In addition, officials called muhtasibs were responsible for supervising bazaars and economic activity in general in the medieval Islamic world.
In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities: The Marshal of France and the Grand Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal's provost, whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal. The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years' War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century. Another organisation, the Constabulary ( Old French : Connétablie), was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337. Under Francis I (reigned 1515–1547), the Maréchaussée was merged with the constabulary. The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée, or, formally, the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France.
In late medieval Italian cities, police forces were known as berovierri. Individually, their members were known as birri. Subordinate to the city's podestà , the berovierri were responsible for guarding the cities and their suburbs, patrolling, and the pursuit and arrest of criminals. They were typically hired on short-term contracts, usually six months. Detailed records from medieval Bologna show that birri had a chain of command, with constables and sergeants managing lower-ranking birri, that they wore uniforms, that they were housed together with other employees of the podestà together with a number of servants including cooks and stable-keepers, that their parentage and places of origin were meticulously recorded, and that most were not native to Bologna, with many coming from outside Italy. [34] [35]
The English system of maintaining public order since the Norman conquest was a private system of tithings known as the mutual pledge system. This system was introduced under Alfred the Great . Communities were divided into groups of ten families called tithings, each of which was overseen by a chief tithingman. Every household head was responsible for the good behavior of his own family and the good behavior of other members of his tithing. Every male aged 12 and over was required to participate in a tithing. Members of tithings were responsible for raising ""hue and cry"" upon witnessing or learning of a crime, and the men of his tithing were responsible for capturing the criminal. The person the tithing captured would then be brought before the chief tithingman, who would determine guilt or innocence and punishment. All members of the criminal's tithing would be responsible for paying the fine. A group of ten tithings was known as a ""hundred"" and every hundred was overseen by an official known as a reeve . Hundreds ensured that if a criminal escaped to a neighboring village, he could be captured and returned to his village. If a criminal was not apprehended, then the entire hundred could be fined. The hundreds were governed by administrative divisions known as shires , the rough equivalent of a modern county , which were overseen by an official known as a shire-reeve, from which the term sheriff evolved. The shire-reeve had the power of posse comitatus , meaning he could gather the men of his shire to pursue a criminal. [36] Following the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the tithing system was tightened with the frankpledge system. By the end of the 13th century, the office of constable developed. Constables had the same responsibilities as chief tithingmen and additionally as royal officers. The constable was elected by his parish every year. Eventually, constables became the first 'police' official to be tax-supported. In urban areas, watchmen were tasked with keeping order and enforcing nighttime curfew. Watchmen guarded the town gates at night, patrolled the streets, arrested those on the streets at night without good reason, and also acted as firefighters. Eventually the office of justice of the peace was established, with a justice of the peace overseeing constables. [37] [38] There was also a system of investigative "" juries "".
The Assize of Arms of 1252 , which required the appointment of constables to summon men to arms, quell breaches of the peace , and to deliver offenders to the sheriff or reeve, is cited as one of the earliest antecedents of the English police. [39] The Statute of Winchester of 1285 is also cited as the primary legislation regulating the policing of the country between the Norman Conquest and the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 . [39] [40]
From about 1500, private watchmen were funded by private individuals and organisations to carry out police functions. They were later nicknamed 'Charlies', probably after the reigning monarch King Charles II. Thief-takers were also rewarded for catching thieves and returning the stolen property. They were private individuals usually hired by crime victims.
The earliest English use of the word police seems to have been the term Polles mentioned in the book The Second Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England published in 1642. [41]
Early modern
The first example of a statutory police force in the world was probably the High Constables of Edinburgh , formed in 1611 to police the streets of Edinburgh , then part of the Kingdom of Scotland . The constables, of whom half were merchants and half were craftsmen, were charged with enforcing 16 regulations relating to curfews, weapons, and theft. [42] At that time, maintenance of public order in Scotland was mainly done by clan chiefs and feudal lords. The first centrally organised and uniformed police force was created by the government of King Louis XIV in 1667 to police the city of Paris , then the largest city in Europe. The royal edict, registered by the Parlement of Paris on March 15, 1667, created the office of lieutenant général de police (""lieutenant general of police""), who was to be the head of the new Paris police force, and defined the task of the police as ""ensuring the peace and quiet of the public and of private individuals, purging the city of what may cause disturbances, procuring abundance, and having each and everyone live according to their station and their duties"".
Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie , founder of the Prefecture of Police , the first uniformed police force in the world
This office was first held by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie , who had 44 commissaires de police ('police commissioners') under his authority. In 1709, these commissioners were assisted by inspecteurs de police ('police inspectors'). The city of Paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the commissaires, each assigned to a particular district and assisted by a growing bureaucracy. The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October 1699, resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities and towns.
After the French Revolution , Napoléon I reorganized the police in Paris and other cities with more than 5,000 inhabitants on February 17, 1800, as the Prefecture of Police . On March 12, 1829, a government decree created the first uniformed police in France , known as sergents de ville ('city sergeants'), which the Paris Prefecture of Police's website claims were the first uniformed policemen in the world. [43]
In feudal Japan, samurai warriors were charged with enforcing the law among commoners. Some Samurai acted as magistrates called Machi-bugyō , who acted as judges, prosecutors, and as chief of police. Beneath them were other Samurai serving as yoriki, or assistant magistrates, who conducted criminal investigations, and beneath them were Samurai serving as dōshin, who were responsible for patrolling the streets, keeping the peace, and making arrests when necessary. The yoriki were responsible for managing the dōshin. Yoriki and dōshin were typically drawn from low-ranking samurai families. Assisting the dōshin were the komono, non-Samurai chōnin who went on patrol with them and provided assistance, the okappiki, non-Samurai from the lowest outcast class, often former criminals, who worked for them as informers and spies, and gōyokiki or meakashi, chōnin, often former criminals, who were hired by local residents and merchants to work as police assistants in a particular neighborhood. This system typically did not apply to the Samurai themselves. Samurai clans were expected to resolve disputes among each other through negotiation, or when that failed through duels. Only rarely did Samurai bring their disputes to a magistrate or answer to police. [44] [45] [46]
In Joseon -era Korea, the Podocheong emerged as a police force with the power to arrest and punish criminals. Established in 1469 as a temporary organization, its role solidified into a permanent one.
In Sweden , local governments were responsible for law and order by way of a royal decree issued by Magnus III in the 13th century. The cities financed and organized groups of watchmen who patrolled the streets. In the late 1500s in Stockholm, patrol duties were in large part taken over by a special corps of salaried city guards . The city guard was organized, uniformed and armed like a military unit and was responsible for interventions against various crimes and the arrest of suspected criminals. These guards were assisted by the military, fire patrolmen, and a civilian unit that did not wear a uniform, but instead wore a small badge around the neck. The civilian unit monitored compliance with city ordinances relating to e.g. sanitation issues, traffic and taxes. In rural areas, the King's bailiffs were responsible for law and order until the establishment of counties in the 1630s. [47] [48]
Up to the early 18th century, the level of state involvement in law enforcement in Britain was low. Although some law enforcement officials existed in the form of constables and watchmen, there was no organized police force. A professional police force like the one already present in France would have been ill-suited to Britain, which saw examples such as the French one as a threat to the people's liberty and balanced constitution in favor of an arbitrary and tyrannical government. Law enforcement was mostly up to the private citizens, who had the right and duty to prosecute crimes in which they were involved or in which they were not. At the cry of 'murder!' or 'stop thief!' everyone was entitled and obliged to join the pursuit. Once the criminal had been apprehended, the parish constables and night watchmen, who were the only public figures provided by the state and who were typically part-time and local, would make the arrest. [49] As a result, the state set a reward to encourage citizens to arrest and prosecute offenders. The first of such rewards was established in 1692 of the amount of £40 for the conviction of a highwayman and in the following years it was extended to burglars, coiners and other forms of offense. The reward was to be increased in 1720 when, after the end of the War of the Spanish Succession and the consequent rise of criminal offenses, the government offered £100 for the conviction of a highwayman. Although the offer of such a reward was conceived as an incentive for the victims of an offense to proceed to the prosecution and to bring criminals to justice, the efforts of the government also increased the number of private thief-takers. Thief-takers became infamously known not so much for what they were supposed to do, catching real criminals and prosecuting them, as for ""setting themselves up as intermediaries between victims and their attackers, extracting payments for the return of stolen goods and using the threat of prosecution to keep offenders in thrall"". Some of them, such as Jonathan Wild , became infamous at the time for staging robberies in order to receive the reward. [50] [51]
In 1737, George II began paying some London and Middlesex watchmen with tax monies, beginning the shift to government control. In 1749, Judge Henry Fielding began organizing a force of quasi-professional constables known as the Bow Street Runners . The Bow Street Runners are considered to have been Britain's first dedicated police force. They represented a formalization and regularization of existing policing methods, similar to the unofficial 'thief-takers'. What made them different was their formal attachment to the Bow Street magistrates' office, and payment by the magistrate with funds from the central government. They worked out of Fielding's office and court at No. 4 Bow Street, and did not patrol but served writs and arrested offenders on the authority of the magistrates, travelling nationwide to apprehend criminals. Fielding wanted to regulate and legalize law enforcement activities due to the high rate of corruption and mistaken or malicious arrests seen with the system that depended mainly on private citizens and state rewards for law enforcement. Henry Fielding's work was carried on by his brother, Justice John Fielding , who succeeded him as magistrate in the Bow Street office. Under John Fielding, the institution of the Bow Street Runners gained more and more recognition from the government, although the force was only funded intermittently in the years that followed. In 1763, the Bow Street Horse Patrol was established to combat highway robbery, funded by a government grant. The Bow Street Runners served as the guiding principle for the way that policing developed over the next 80 years. Bow Street was a manifestation of the move towards increasing professionalisation and state control of street life, beginning in London.
The Macdaniel affair , a 1754 British political scandal in which a group of thief-takers was found to be falsely prosecuting innocent men in order to collect reward money from bounties , [52] added further impetus for a publicly salaried police force that did not depend on rewards. Nonetheless, In 1828, there were privately financed police units in no fewer than 45 parishes within a 10-mile radius of London.
The word police was borrowed from French into the English language in the 18th century, but for a long time it applied only to French and continental European police forces. The word, and the concept of police itself, were ""disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression"". [53] Before the 19th century, the first use of the word police recorded in government documents in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in 1714 and the creation of the Marine Police in 1798.
Modern
Scotland and Ireland
Following early police forces established in 1779 and 1788 in Glasgow , Scotland , the Glasgow authorities successfully petitioned the government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police in 1800. [54] Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament. [55] In Ireland , the Irish Constabulary Act 1822 marked the beginning of the Royal Irish Constabulary . The act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at Dublin Castle . By 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men.
London
Patrick Colquhoun , founder of the Thames River Police
In 1797, Patrick Colquhoun was able to persuade the West Indies merchants who operated at the Pool of London on the River Thames to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500,000 worth of cargo in imports alone. [56] The idea of a police, as it then existed in France , was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import. In building the case for the police in the face of England's firm anti-police sentiment, Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was ""perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution"". Moreover, he went so far as to praise the French system, which had reached ""the greatest degree of perfection"" in his estimation. [57]
Poster against ""detested"" Police posted in the town of Aberystwyth , Wales , April 1850
With the initial investment of £4,200, the new force the Marine Police began with about 50 men charged with policing 33,000 workers in the river trades, of whom Colquhoun claimed 11,000 were known criminals and ""on the game"". The force was part funded by the London Society of West India Planters and Merchants . The force was a success after its first year, and his men had ""established their worth by saving £122,000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives"". Word of this success spread quickly, and the government passed the Depredations on the Thames Act 1800 on 28 July 1800, establishing a fully funded police force the Thames River Police together with new laws including police powers; now the oldest police force in the world. Colquhoun published a book on the experiment, The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames. It found receptive audiences far outside London, and inspired similar forces in other cities, notably, New York City , Dublin , and Sydney . [56]
Colquhoun's utilitarian approach to the problem – using a cost-benefit argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives. Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street, the river police were full-time, salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees. [58] His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing ; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames. [57]
Metropolitan

London was fast reaching a size unprecedented in world history, due to the onset of the Industrial Revolution . [59] It became clear that the locally maintained system of volunteer constables and ""watchmen"" was ineffective, both in detecting and preventing crime. A parliamentary committee was appointed to investigate the system of policing in London . Upon Sir Robert Peel being appointed as Home Secretary in 1822, he established a second and more effective committee, and acted upon its findings.
Royal assent to the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 was given [60] and the Metropolitan Police Service was established on September 29, 1829, in London . [61] [62] Peel, widely regarded as the father of modern policing, [63] was heavily influenced by the social and legal philosophy of Jeremy Bentham , who called for a strong and centralised, but politically neutral, police force for the maintenance of social order, for the protection of people from crime and to act as a visible deterrent to urban crime and disorder. [64] Peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession, to organise it in a civilian fashion, and to make it answerable to the public. [65]

Due to public fears concerning the deployment of the military in domestic matters, Peel organised the force along civilian lines, rather than paramilitary . To appear neutral, the uniform was deliberately manufactured in blue, rather than red which was then a military colour, along with the officers being armed only with a wooden truncheon and a rattle [66] to signal the need for assistance. Along with this, police ranks did not include military titles, with the exception of Sergeant .
To distance the new police force from the initial public view of it as a new tool of government repression, Peel publicised the so-called Peelian principles , which set down basic guidelines for ethical policing: [67] [68]
Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests but on the deterrence of crime.
Above all else, an effective authority figure knows trust and accountability are paramount. Hence, Peel's most often quoted principle that ""The police are the public and the public are the police.""

The Metropolitan Police Act 1829 created a modern police force by limiting the purview of the force and its powers and envisioning it as merely an organ of the judicial system. Their job was apolitical; to maintain the peace and apprehend criminals for the courts to process according to the law. [70] This was very different from the "" continental model"" of the police force that had been developed in France, where the police force worked within the parameters of the absolutist state as an extension of the authority of the monarch and functioned as part of the governing state.
In 1863, the Metropolitan Police were issued with the distinctive custodian helmet , and in 1884 they switched to the use of whistles that could be heard from much further away. [71] [72] The Metropolitan Police became a model for the police forces in many countries, including the United States and most of the British Empire . [73] [74] Bobbies can still be found in many parts of the Commonwealth of Nations .
Australia

In Australia , organized law enforcement emerged soon after British colonization began in 1788. The first law enforcement organizations were the Night Watch and Row Boat Guard, which were formed in 1789 to police Sydney . Their ranks were drawn from well-behaved convicts deported to Australia. The Night Watch was replaced by the Sydney Foot Police in 1790. In New South Wales , rural law enforcement officials were appointed by local justices of the peace during the early to mid-19th century and were referred to as ""bench police"" or ""benchers"". A mounted police force was formed in 1825. [75]
The first police force having centralised command as well as jurisdiction over an entire colony was the South Australia Police , formed in 1838 under Henry Inman . However, whilst the New South Wales Police Force was established in 1862, it was made up from a large number of policing and military units operating within the then Colony of New South Wales and traces its links back to the Royal Marines. The passing of the Police Regulation Act of 1862 essentially tightly regulated and centralised all of the police forces operating throughout the Colony of New South Wales.
Each Australian state and territory maintain its own police force, while the Australian Federal Police enforces laws at the federal level. The New South Wales Police Force remains the largest police force in Australia in terms of personnel and physical resources. It is also the only police force that requires its recruits to undertake university studies at the recruit level and has the recruit pay for their own education.
Brazil

In 1566, the first police investigator of Rio de Janeiro was recruited. By the 17th century, most captaincies already had local units with law enforcement functions. On July 9, 1775, a Cavalry Regiment was created in the state of Minas Gerais for maintaining law and order. In 1808, the Portuguese royal family relocated to Brazil, because of the French invasion of Portugal. King João VI established the Intendência Geral de Polícia ('General Police Intendancy') for investigations. He also created a Royal Police Guard for Rio de Janeiro in 1809. In 1831, after independence, each province started organizing its local "" military police "", with order maintenance tasks. The Federal Railroad Police was created in 1852, Federal Highway Police , was established in 1928, and Federal Police in 1967.
Canada

During the early days of English and French colonization, municipalities hired watchmen and constables to provide security. [76] Established in 1729, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary (RNC) was the first policing service founded in Canada. The establishment of modern policing services in the Canadas occurred during the 1830s, modelling their services after the London Metropolitan Police, and adopting the ideas of the Peelian principles. [77] The Toronto Police Service was established in 1834 as the first municipal police service in Canada. Prior to that, local able-bodied male citizens had been required to report for night watch duty as special constables for a fixed number of nights a year on penalty of a fine or imprisonment in a system known as ""watch and ward."" [78] The Quebec City Police Service was established in 1840. [77]
A national police service, the Dominion Police , was founded in 1868. Initially the Dominion Police provided security for parliament, but its responsibilities quickly grew. In 1870, Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory were incorporated into the country. In an effort to police its newly acquired territory, the Canadian government established the North-West Mounted Police in 1873 (renamed Royal North-West Mounted Police in 1904). [77] In 1920, the Dominion Police, and the Royal Northwest Mounted Police were amalgamated into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). [77]
The RCMP provides federal law enforcement; and law enforcement in eight provinces, and all three territories. The provinces of Ontario , and Quebec maintain their own provincial police forces, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), and the Sûreté du Québec (SQ). Policing in Newfoundland and Labrador is provided by the RCMP, and the RNC. The aforementioned services also provide municipal policing, although larger Canadian municipalities may establish their own police service.
Lebanon
In Lebanon , the current police force was established in 1861, with creation of the Gendarmerie . [79]
India

Under the Mughal Empire , provincial governors called subahdars (or nazims), as well as officials known as faujdars and thanadars were tasked with keeping law and order. Kotwals were responsible for public order in urban areas. In addition, officials called amils, whose primary duties were tax collection, occasionally dealt with rebels. The system evolved under growing British influence that eventually culminated in the establishment of the British Raj . In 1770, the offices of faujdar and amil were abolished. They were brought back in 1774 by Warren Hastings , the first Governor of the Presidency of Fort William (Bengal) . In 1791, the first permanent police force was established by Charles Cornwallis , the Commander-in-Chief of British India and Governor of the Presidency of Fort William. [80]
A single police force was established after the formation of the British Raj with the Government of India Act 1858 . A uniform police bureaucracy was formed under the Police Act 1861, which established the Superior Police Services. This later evolved into the Indian Imperial Police , which kept order until the Partition of India and independence in 1947. In 1948, the Indian Imperial Police was replaced by the Indian Police Service .
In modern India , the police are under the control of respective States and union territories and are known to be under State Police Services (SPS). The candidates selected for the SPS are usually posted as Deputy Superintendent of Police or Assistant Commissioner of Police once their probationary period ends. On prescribed satisfactory service in the SPS, the officers are nominated to the Indian Police Service . [81] The service color is usually dark blue and red, while the uniform color is Khaki. [82]
United States

In Colonial America , the county sheriff was the most important law enforcement official. For instance, the New York Sheriff's Office was founded in 1626, and the Albany County Sheriff's Department in the 1660s. The county sheriff, who was an elected official, was responsible for enforcing laws, collecting taxes, supervising elections, and handling the legal business of the county government. Sheriffs would investigate crimes and make arrests after citizens filed complaints or provided information about a crime but did not carry out patrols or otherwise take preventive action. Villages and cities typically hired constables and marshals, who were empowered to make arrests and serve warrants. Many municipalities also formed a night watch, a group of citizen volunteers who would patrol the streets at night looking for crime and fires. Typically, constables and marshals were the main law enforcement officials available during the day while the night watch would serve during the night. Eventually, municipalities formed day watch groups. Rioting was handled by local militias. [83] [84]
In the 1700s, the Province of Carolina (later North - and South Carolina ) established slave patrols in order to prevent slave rebellions and enslaved people from escaping. [85] [86] By 1785 the Charleston Guard and Watch had ""a distinct chain of command , uniforms , sole responsibility for policing, salary , authorized use of force , and a focus on preventing crime ."" [87]
In 1789 the United States Marshals Service was established, followed by other federal services such as the U.S. Parks Police (1791) [88] and U.S. Mint Police (1792). [89] In 1751 moves towards a municipal police service in Philadelphia were made when the city's night watchmen and constables began receiving wages and a Board of Wardens was created to oversee the night watch. [90] [91] Municipal police services were createed in Richmond, Virginia in 1807, [92] Boston in 1838, [93] and New York City in 1845. [94] The United States Secret Service was founded in 1865 and was for some time the main investigative body for the federal government. [95]

Modern policing influenced by the British model of policing established in 1829 based on the Peelian principles began emerging in the United States in the mid-19th century, replacing previous law enforcement systems based primarily on night watch organizations. [96] Cities began establishing organized, publicly funded, full-time professional police services. In Boston , a day police consisting of six officers under the command of the city marshal was established in 1838 to supplement the city's night watch. This paved the way for the establishment of the Boston Police Department in 1854. [97] [98] In New York City , law enforcement up to the 1840s was handled by a night watch as well as 100 city marshals, 51 municipal police officers, and 31 constables. In 1845, the New York City Police Department was established. [99] In Philadelphia , the first police officers to patrol the city in daytime were employed in 1833 as a supplement to the night watch system, leading to the establishment of the Philadelphia Police Department in 1854. [100]
In the American Old West , law enforcement was carried out by local sheriffs, rangers, constables, and federal marshals. There were also town marshals responsible for serving civil and criminal warrants, maintaining the jails, and carrying out arrests for petty crime. [101] [102]
In addition to federal, state, and local forces, some special districts have been formed to provide extra police protection in designated areas. These districts may be known as neighborhood improvement districts, crime prevention districts, or security districts. [103]
In 2022, San Francisco supervisors approved a policy allowing municipal police ( San Francisco Police Department ) to use robots for various law enforcement and emergency operations, permitting their employment as a deadly force option in cases where the ""risk of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option available to SFPD."" [104] This policy has been criticized by groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU , who have argued that ""killer robots will not make San Francisco better"" and ""police might even bring armed robots to a protest."" [105] [106]
Development of theory
Michel Foucault wrote that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by German and French legal scholars and practitioners in public administration and statistics in the 17th and early 18th centuries, most notably with Nicolas Delamare's Traité de la Police (""Treatise on the Police""), first published in 1705. The German Polizeiwissenschaft (Science of Police) first theorized by Philipp von Hörnigk , a 17th-century Austrian political economist and civil servant, and much more famously by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi , who produced an important theoretical work known as Cameral science on the formulation of police. [107] Foucault cites Magdalene Humpert author of Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften (1937) in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over 4,000 pieces of the practice of Polizeiwissenschaft. However, this may be a mistranslation of Foucault's own work since the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over 14,000 items were produced from the 16th century dates ranging from 1520 to 1850. [108] [109]
As conceptualized by the Polizeiwissenschaft, according to Foucault the police had an administrative, economic and social duty (""procuring abundance""). It was in charge of demographic concerns[ vague ] and needed to be incorporated within the western political philosophy system of raison d'état and therefore giving the superficial appearance of empowering the population (and unwittingly supervising the population), which, according to mercantilist theory, was to be the main strength of the state . Thus, its functions largely overreached simple law enforcement activities and included public health concerns, urban planning (which was important because of the miasma theory of disease ; thus, cemeteries were moved out of town, etc.), and surveillance of prices . [110]
Jeremy Bentham , philosopher who advocated for the establishment of preventive police forces and influenced the reforms of Sir Robert Peel
The concept of preventive policing, or policing to deter crime from taking place, gained influence in the late 18th century. Police Magistrate John Fielding , head of the Bow Street Runners , argued that ""...it is much better to prevent even one man from being a rogue than apprehending and bringing forty to justice."" [111]
The Utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham , promoted the views of Italian Marquis Cesare Beccaria , and disseminated a translated version of ""Essay on Crime in Punishment"". Bentham espoused the guiding principle of ""the greatest good for the greatest number"":
It is better to prevent crimes than to punish them. This is the chief aim of every good system of legislation, which is the art of leading men to the greatest possible happiness or to the least possible misery, according to calculation of all the goods and evils of life. [111]
Patrick Colquhoun 's influential work, A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis (1797) was heavily influenced by Benthamite thought. Colquhoun's Thames River Police was founded on these principles, and in contrast to the Bow Street Runners , acted as a deterrent by their continual presence on the riverfront, in addition to being able to intervene if they spotted a crime in progress. [112]
Edwin Chadwick 's 1829 article, ""Preventive police"" in the London Review, [113] argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body, which was not the case in practice. The reason, argued Chadwick, was that ""A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation."" In contrast to a deterrent of punishment, a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective – ""crime doesn't pay"". In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act, the ""object"" of the new Metropolitan Police, was changed by Robert Peel to the ""principal object,"" which was the ""prevention of crime."" [114] Later historians would attribute the perception of England's ""appearance of orderliness and love of public order"" to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel's police system. [115]
Development of modern police forces around the world was contemporary to the formation of the state, later defined by sociologist Max Weber as achieving a "" monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force "" and which was primarily exercised by the police and the military . Marxist theory situates the development of the modern state as part of the rise of capitalism, in which the police are one component of the bourgeoisie 's repressive apparatus for subjugating the working class . By contrast, the Peelian principles argue that ""the power of the police ... is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behavior"", a philosophy known as policing by consent .
Personnel and organization
Police forces include both preventive (uniformed) police and detectives . Terminology varies from country to country. Police functions include protecting life and property, enforcing criminal law , criminal investigations, regulating traffic, crowd control, public safety duties, civil defense, emergency management, searching for missing persons, lost property and other duties concerned with public order. Regardless of size, police forces are generally organized as a hierarchy with multiple ranks . The exact structures and the names of rank vary considerably by country.
Uniformed
Uniformed police officers of the West Midlands Police
The police who wear uniforms make up the majority of a police service's personnel. Their main duty is to respond to calls for service . When not responding to these calls, they do work aimed at preventing crime, such as patrols . The uniformed police are known by varying names such as preventive police, the uniform branch/division, administrative police, order police, the patrol bureau/division, or patrol. In Australia and the United Kingdom, patrol personnel are also known as ""general duties"" officers. [116] Atypically, Brazil 's preventive police are known as Military Police . [117]
As stated by the name, uniformed police wear uniforms . They perform functions that require an immediate recognition of an officer's legal authority and a potential need for force. Most commonly this means intervening to stop a crime in progress and securing the scene of a crime that has already happened. Besides dealing with crime, these officers may also manage and monitor traffic, carry out community policing duties, maintain order at public events or carry out searches for missing people (in 2012, the latter accounted for 14% of police time in the United Kingdom). [118] As most of these duties must be available as a 24/7 service , uniformed police are required to do shift work .
Detectives

Police detectives are responsible for investigations and detective work. Detectives may be called Investigations Police, Judiciary/Judicial Police, or Criminal Police. In the United Kingdom, they are often referred to by the name of their department, the Criminal Investigation Department . Detectives typically make up roughly 15–25% of a police service's personnel.
Detectives, in contrast to uniformed police, typically wear business-styled attire in bureaucratic and investigative functions, where a uniformed presence would be either a distraction or intimidating but a need to establish police authority still exists. ""Plainclothes"" officers dress in attire consistent with that worn by the general public for purposes of blending in.
In some cases, police are assigned to work "" undercover "", where they conceal their police identity to investigate crimes, such as organized crime or narcotics crime, that are unsolvable by other means. In some cases, this type of policing shares aspects with espionage .
The relationship between detective and uniformed branches varies by country. In the United States, there is high variation within the country itself. Many American police departments require detectives to spend some time on temporary assignments in the patrol division.[ citation needed ] [119] The argument is that rotating officers helps the detectives to better understand the uniformed officers' work, to promote cross-training in a wider variety of skills, and prevent ""cliques"" that can contribute to corruption or other unethical behavior.[ citation needed ] Conversely, some countries regard detective work as being an entirely separate profession, with detectives working in separate agencies and recruited without having to serve in uniform. A common compromise in English-speaking countries is that most detectives are recruited from the uniformed branch, but once qualified they tend to spend the rest of their careers in the detective branch.
Another point of variation is whether detectives have extra status. In some forces, such as the New York Police Department and Philadelphia Police Department , a regular detective holds a higher rank than a regular police officer. In others, such as British police and Canadian police , a regular detective has equal status with regular uniformed officers. Officers still have to take exams to move to the detective branch, but the move is regarded as being a specialization, rather than a promotion.
Volunteers and auxiliary
Police services often include part-time or volunteer officers, some of whom have other jobs outside policing. These may be paid positions or entirely volunteer. These are known by a variety of names, such as reserves, auxiliary police or special constables .
Other volunteer organizations work with the police and perform some of their duties. Groups in the U.S. including the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program , Community Emergency Response Team , and the Boy Scouts Police Explorers provide training, traffic and crowd control, disaster response, and other policing duties. In the U.S., the Volunteers in Police Service program assists over 200,000 volunteers in almost 2,000 programs. [120] Volunteers may also work on the support staff. Examples of these schemes are Volunteers in Police Service in the US, Police Support Volunteers in the UK and Volunteers in Policing in New South Wales.
Specialized

Specialized preventive and detective groups, or Specialist Investigation Departments , exist within many law enforcement organizations either for dealing with particular types of crime, such as traffic law enforcement, K9/use of police dogs , crash investigation, homicide , or fraud ; or for situations requiring specialized skills, such as underwater search , aviation , explosive disposal (""bomb squad""), and computer crime .
Most larger jurisdictions employ police tactical units , specially selected and trained paramilitary units with specialized equipment, weapons, and training, for the purposes of dealing with particularly violent situations beyond the capability of a patrol officer response, including standoffs, counterterrorism, and rescue operations.
In counterinsurgency -type campaigns, select and specially trained units of police armed and equipped as light infantry have been designated as police field forces who perform paramilitary -type patrols and ambushes whilst retaining their police powers in areas that were highly dangerous. [121]
Because their situational mandate typically focuses on removing innocent bystanders from dangerous people and dangerous situations, not violent resolution, they are often equipped with non-lethal tactical tools like chemical agents , stun grenades , and rubber bullets. The Specialist Firearms Command (MO19) [122] of the Metropolitan Police in London is a group of armed police used in dangerous situations including hostage taking, armed robbery/assault and terrorism.
Administrative duties
Police may have administrative duties that are not directly related to enforcing the law, such as issuing firearms licenses . The extent that police have these functions varies among countries, with police in France , Germany , and other continental European countries handling such tasks to a greater extent than British counterparts. [116]
Military

Military police may refer to:
a section of the military solely responsible for policing the armed forces , referred to as provosts (e.g., United States Air Force Security Forces )
a section of the military responsible for policing in both the armed forces and in the civilian population (e.g., most gendarmeries , such as the French Gendarmerie , the Italian Carabinieri , the Spanish Guardia Civil , and the Portuguese National Republican Guard )
a section of the military solely responsible for policing the civilian population (e.g., Romanian Gendarmerie )
the civilian preventive police of a Brazilian state (e.g., Policia Militar )
a special military law enforcement service (e.g., Russian Military Police )
Religious
Main article: Religious police
Some jurisdictions with religious laws may have dedicated religious police to enforce said laws. These religious police forces, which may operate either as a unit of a wider police force or as an independent agency, may only have jurisdiction over members of said religion, or they may have the ability to enforce religious customs nationwide regardless of individual religious beliefs.
Religious police may enforce social norms , gender roles , dress codes , and dietary laws per religious doctrine and laws, and may also prohibit practices that run contrary to said doctrine, such as atheism , proselytism , homosexuality , socialization between different genders , business operations during religious periods or events such as salah or the Sabbath , or the sale and possession of ""offending material"" ranging from pornography to foreign media . [123] [124]
Forms of religious law enforcement were relatively common in historical religious civilizations, but eventually declined in favor of religious tolerance and pluralism . One of the most common forms of religious police in the modern world are Islamic religious police , which enforce the application of Sharia ( Islamic religious law). As of 2018, there are eight Islamic countries that maintain Islamic religious police: Afghanistan , Iran , Iraq , Mauritania , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Sudan , and Yemen . [125]
Some forms of religious police may not enforce religious law, but rather suppress religion or religious extremism . This is often done for ideological reasons; for example, communist states such as China and Vietnam have historically suppressed and tightly controlled religions such as Christianity .
Secret
Main article: Secret police
Secret police organizations are typically used to suppress dissidents for engaging in non-politically correct communications and activities, which are deemed counter-productive to what the state and related establishment promote. Secret police interventions to stop such activities are often illegal, and are designed to debilitate, in various ways, the people targeted in order to limit or stop outright their ability to act in a non-politically correct manner. [126] The methods employed may involve spying , various acts of deception, intimidation , framing , false imprisonment , false incarceration under mental health legislation , and physical violence . [127] Countries widely reported to use secret police organizations include China [128] ( The Ministry of State Security ) and North Korea ( The Ministry of State Security ). [129]

Police forces are usually organized and funded by some level of government. The level of government responsible for policing varies from place to place, and may be at the national, regional or local level. Some countries have police forces that serve the same territory, with their jurisdiction depending on the type of crime or other circumstances. Other countries, such as Austria , Chile , Israel , New Zealand , the Philippines , South Africa and Sweden , have a single national police force. [130]
In some places with multiple national police forces, one common arrangement is to have a civilian police force and a paramilitary gendarmerie , such as the Police Nationale and National Gendarmerie in France . [116] The French policing system spread to other countries through the Napoleonic Wars [131] and the French colonial empire . [132] [133] Another example is the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil in Spain . In both France and Spain, the civilian force polices urban areas and the paramilitary force polices rural areas. Italy has a similar arrangement with the Polizia di Stato and Carabinieri , though their jurisdictions overlap more. Some countries have separate agencies for uniformed police and detectives, such as the Military Police and Civil Police in Brazil and the Carabineros and Investigations Police in Chile .
Other countries have sub-national police forces, but for the most part their jurisdictions do not overlap. In many countries, especially federations , there may be two or more tiers of police force, each serving different levels of government and enforcing different subsets of the law. In Australia and Germany , the majority of policing is carried out by state (i.e. provincial) police forces, which are supplemented by a federal police force. Though not a federation, the United Kingdom has a similar arrangement, where policing is primarily the responsibility of a regional police force and specialist units exist at the national level. In Canada , the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are the federal police, while municipalities can decide whether to run a local police service or to contract local policing duties to a larger one. Most urban areas have a local police service, while most rural areas contract it to the RCMP, or to the provincial police in Ontario and Quebec .
The United States has a highly decentralized and fragmented system of law enforcement, with over 17,000 state and local law enforcement agencies. [134] These agencies include local police, county law enforcement (often in the form of a sheriff's office , or county police ), state police and federal law enforcement agencies . Federal agencies, such as the FBI , only have jurisdiction over federal crimes or those that involve more than one state. Other federal agencies have jurisdiction over a specific type of crime. Examples include the Federal Protective Service , which patrols and protects government buildings; the Postal Inspection Service , which protect United States Postal Service facilities, vehicles and items; the Park Police , which protect national parks; and Amtrak Police , which patrol Amtrak stations and trains. There are also some government agencies and uniformed services that perform police functions in addition to other duties, such as the Coast Guard .
International

Most countries are members of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), established to detect and fight transnational crime and provide for international co-operation and co-ordination of other police activities, such as notifying relatives of the death of foreign nationals. Interpol does not conduct investigations or arrests by itself, but only serves as a central point for information on crime, suspects and criminals. Political crimes are excluded from its competencies.
The terms international policing, transnational policing, and/or global policing began to be used from the early 1990s onwards to describe forms of policing that transcended the boundaries of the sovereign nation-state. [135] [136] These terms refer in variable ways to practices and forms for policing that, in some sense, transcend national borders. This includes a variety of practices, but international police cooperation, criminal intelligence exchange between police agencies working in different nation-states, and police development-aid to weak, failed or failing states are the three types that have received the most scholarly attention.
Historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross-border police missions for many years. [137] For example, in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals. A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London. The interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe, which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before World War II . There are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century. [135] It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception. It is also generally agreed that in the post– Cold War era this type of practice became more significant and frequent. [138]
Few empirical works on the practices of inter/transnational information and intelligence sharing have been undertaken. A notable exception is James Sheptycki 's study of police cooperation in the English Channel region, [139] which provides a systematic content analysis of information exchange files and a description of how these transnational information and intelligence exchanges are transformed into police casework. The study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross-Channel region from 1968 on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned. By 1992, with the signing of the Schengen Treaty , which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the European Union , there were worries that much, if not all, of this intelligence sharing was opaque, raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in Europe. [140]
Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer, so it is difficult to make generalizations, but one small-scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross-border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that the low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature. [141] Intelligence-led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries [142] and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world. [142] James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing-intelligence and suggests that a number of ""organizational pathologies"" have arisen that make the functioning of security-intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic. He argues that transnational police information circuits help to ""compose the panic scenes of the security-control society"". [143] The paradoxical effect is that, the harder policing agencies work to produce security, the greater are feelings of insecurity.
Police development-aid to weak, failed or failing states is another form of transnational policing that has garnered attention. This form of transnational policing plays an increasingly important role in United Nations peacekeeping and this looks set to grow in the years ahead, especially as the international community seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in states recovering from conflict. [144] With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions. [145]
One topic concerns making transnational policing institutions democratically accountable. [146] According to the Global Accountability Report for 2007, Interpol had the lowest scores in its category (IGOs), coming in tenth with a score of 22% on overall accountability capabilities. [147]
Overseas policing
See also: Chinese police overseas service stations
A police force may establish its presence in a foreign country with or without the permission of the host state. In the case of China and the ruling Communist Party , this has involved setting up unofficial police service stations around the world, and using coercive means to influence the behaviour of members of the Chinese diaspora and especially those who hold Chinese citizenship. Political dissidents have been harassed and intimidated in a form of transnational repression and convinced to return to China. [148] Many of these actions were illegal in the states where they occurred. Such police stations have been established in dozens of countries around the world, [149] with some, such as the UK [150] and the US, [151] forcing them to close.
Equipment
Weapons

In many jurisdictions, police officers carry firearms , primarily handguns , in the normal course of their duties. In the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland ), Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and Malta, with the exception of specialist units, officers do not carry firearms as a matter of course. New Zealand and Norwegian police carry firearms in their vehicles, but not on their duty belts, and must obtain authorization before the weapons can be removed from the vehicle unless their life or the life of others are in danger. [152]
Police often have specialized units for handling armed offenders or dangerous situations where combat is likely, such as police tactical units or authorised firearms officers . In some jurisdictions, depending on the circumstances, police can call on the military for assistance, as military aid to the civil power is an aspect of many armed forces. Perhaps the most high-profile example of this was in 1980, when the British Army 's Special Air Service was deployed to resolve the Iranian Embassy siege on behalf of the Metropolitan Police .
They can also be armed with ""non-lethal"" (more accurately known as ""less than lethal"" or ""less-lethal"" given that they can still be deadly [153] ) weaponry, particularly for riot control , or to inflict pain against a resistant suspect to force them to surrender without lethally wounding them. Non-lethal weapons include batons , tear gas , riot control agents , rubber bullets , riot shields , water cannons , and electroshock weapons . Police officers typically carry handcuffs to restrain suspects.
The use of firearms or deadly force is typically a last resort only to be used when necessary to save the lives of others or themselves, though some jurisdictions (such as Brazil) allow its use against fleeing felons and escaped convicts. Police officers in the United States are generally allowed to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger, a policy that has been criticized for being vague. [154] South African police have a ""shoot-to-kill"" policy, which allows officers to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them. [155] With the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime, President Jacob Zuma stated that South Africa needs to handle crime differently from other countries. [156]
Communications
Modern police forces make extensive use of two-way radio communications equipment, carried both on the person and installed in vehicles, to coordinate their work, share information, and get help quickly. Vehicle-installed mobile data terminals enhance the ability of police communications, enabling easier dispatching of calls, criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds, and updating officers' daily activity log and other required reports, on a real-time basis. Other common pieces of police equipment include flashlights , whistles , police notebooks , and ""ticket books"" or citations . Some police departments have developed advanced computerized data display and communication systems to bring real time data to officers, one example being the NYPD's Domain Awareness System .
Vehicles

Police vehicles are used for detaining, patrolling, and transporting over wide areas that an officer could not effectively cover otherwise. The average police car used for standard patrol is a four-door sedan , SUV , or CUV , often modified by the manufacturer or police force's fleet services to provide better performance. Pickup trucks , off-road vehicles , and vans are often used in utility roles, though in some jurisdictions or situations (such as those where dirt roads are common, off-roading is required, or the nature of the officer's assignment necessitates it), they may be used as standard patrol cars. Sports cars are typically not used by police due to cost and maintenance issues, though those that are used are typically only assigned to traffic enforcement or community policing , and are rarely, if ever, assigned to standard patrol or authorized to respond to dangerous calls (such as armed calls or pursuits) where the likelihood of the vehicle being damaged or destroyed is high. Police vehicles are usually marked with appropriate symbols and equipped with sirens and flashing emergency lights to make others aware of police presence or response; in most jurisdictions, police vehicles with their sirens and emergency lights on have right of way in traffic, while in other jurisdictions, emergency lights may be kept on while patrolling to ensure ease of visibility. Unmarked or undercover police vehicles are used primarily for traffic enforcement or apprehending criminals without alerting them to their presence. The use of unmarked police vehicles for traffic enforcement is controversial, with the state of New York banning this practice in 1996 on the grounds that it endangered motorists who might be pulled over by police impersonators . [157]
Motorcycles , having historically been a mainstay in police fleets, are commonly used, particularly in locations that a car may not be able to reach, to control potential public order situations involving meetings of motorcyclists, and often in police escorts where motorcycle police officers can quickly clear a path for escorted vehicles. Bicycle patrols are used in some areas, often downtown areas or parks, because they allow for wider and faster area coverage than officers on foot. Bicycles are also commonly used by riot police to create makeshift barricades against protesters. [158]
Police aviation consists of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft , while police watercraft tend to consist of RHIBs , motorboats , and patrol boats . SWAT vehicles are used by police tactical units, and often consist of four-wheeled armored personnel carriers used to transport tactical teams while providing armored cover, equipment storage space, or makeshift battering ram capabilities; these vehicles are typically not armed and do not patrol and are only used to transport. Mobile command posts may also be used by some police forces to establish identifiable command centers at the scene of major situations.
Police cars may contain issued long guns , ammunition for issued weapons, less-lethal weaponry, riot control equipment, traffic cones , road flares , physical barricades or barricade tape , fire extinguishers , [159] first aid kits , or defibrillators . [160]
Strategies

The advent of the police car, two-way radio , and telephone in the early 20th century transformed policing into a reactive strategy that focused on responding to calls for service away from their beat . [161] With this transformation, police command and control became more centralized.
In the United States, August Vollmer introduced other reforms, including education requirements for police officers. [162] O.W. Wilson , a student of Vollmer, helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita, Kansas , and later in the Chicago Police Department . [163] Strategies employed by O.W. Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption, establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force, a strict merit system for promotions within the department, and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers. [164] During the professionalism era of policing, law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime and conducting visible car patrols in between, rather than broader focus on crime prevention . [165]
The Kansas City Preventive Patrol study in the early 1970s showed flaws in using visible car patrols for crime prevention. It found that aimless car patrols did little to deter crime and often went unnoticed by the public. Patrol officers in cars had insufficient contact and interaction with the community, leading to a social rift between the two. [166] In the 1980s and 1990s, many law enforcement agencies began to adopt community policing strategies, and others adopted problem-oriented policing .
Broken windows' policing was another, related approach introduced in the 1980s by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling , who suggested that police should pay greater attention to minor ""quality of life"" offenses and disorderly conduct. The concept behind this method is simple: broken windows, graffiti, and other physical destruction or degradation of property create an environment in which crime and disorder is more likely. The presence of broken windows and graffiti sends a message that authorities do not care and are not trying to correct problems in these areas. Therefore, correcting these small problems prevents more serious criminal activity. [167] The theory was popularised in the early 1990s by police chief William J. Bratton and New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani . It was emulated in 2010s in Kazakhstan through zero tolerance policing. Yet it failed to produce meaningful results in this country because citizens distrusted police while state leaders preferred police loyalty over police good behavior. [168]
Building upon these earlier models, intelligence-led policing has also become an important strategy. Intelligence-led policing and problem-oriented policing are complementary strategies, both of which involve systematic use of information. [169] Although it still lacks a universally accepted definition, the crux of intelligence-led policing is an emphasis on the collection and analysis of information to guide police operations, rather than the reverse. [170]
A related development is evidence-based policing . In a similar vein to evidence-based policy , evidence-based policing is the use of controlled experiments to find which methods of policing are more effective. Leading advocates of evidence-based policing include the criminologist Lawrence W. Sherman and philanthropist Jerry Lee . Findings from controlled experiments include the Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment , [171] evidence that patrols deter crime if they are concentrated in crime hotspots [172] and that restricting police powers to shoot suspects does not cause an increase in crime or violence against police officers. [173] Use of experiments to assess the usefulness of strategies has been endorsed by many police services and institutions, including the U.S. Police Foundation and the UK College of Policing .
Power restrictions
Los Angeles Police Department officers arresting suspects during a traffic stop
In many nations, criminal procedure law has been developed to regulate officers' discretion, so that they do not arbitrarily or unjustly exercise their powers of arrest , search and seizure , and use of force . In the United States, Miranda v. Arizona led to the widespread use of Miranda warnings or constitutional warnings.
In Miranda the court created safeguards against self-incriminating statements made after an arrest. The court held that ""The prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way, unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination"" [174]
Police in the United States are also prohibited from holding criminal suspects for more than a reasonable amount of time (usually 24–48 hours) before arraignment , using torture , abuse or physical threats to extract confessions , using excessive force to effect an arrest, and searching suspects' bodies or their homes without a warrant obtained upon a showing of probable cause . The four exceptions to the constitutional requirement of a search warrant are:
Consent
Motor vehicle searches
Exigent circumstances
In Terry v. Ohio (1968) the court divided seizure into two parts, the investigatory stop and arrest. The court further held that during an investigatory stop a police officer's search "" [is] confined to what [is] minimally necessary to determine whether [a suspect] is armed, and the intrusion, which [is] made for the sole purpose of protecting himself and others nearby, [is] confined to ascertaining the presence of weapons"" (U.S. Supreme Court). Before Terry, every police encounter constituted an arrest, giving the police officer the full range of search authority. Search authority during a Terry stop (investigatory stop) is limited to weapons only. [174]
Using deception for confessions is permitted, but not coercion. There are exceptions or exigent circumstances such as an articulated need to disarm a suspect or searching a suspect who has already been arrested (Search Incident to an Arrest). The Posse Comitatus Act severely restricts the use of the military for police activity, giving added importance to police SWAT units.
British police officers are governed by similar rules, such as those introduced to England and Wales under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), but generally have greater powers. They may, for example, legally search any suspect who has been arrested, or their vehicles, home or business premises, without a warrant, and may seize anything they find in a search as evidence.
All police officers in the United Kingdom, whatever their actual rank, are 'constables' in terms of their legal position. This means that a newly appointed constable has the same arrest powers as a Chief Constable or Commissioner. However, certain higher ranks have additional powers to authorize certain aspects of police operations, such as a power to authorize a search of a suspect's house (section 18 PACE in England and Wales) by an officer of the rank of Inspector, or the power to authorize a suspect's detention beyond 24 hours by a Superintendent.
Conduct, accountability and public confidence
Hong Kong Police Force officers aiming firearms at protestors in Wong Tai Sin District during the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests
Police services commonly include units for investigating crimes committed by the police themselves. These units are typically called internal affairs or inspectorate-general units. In some countries separate organizations outside the police exist for such purposes, such as the British Independent Office for Police Conduct . However, due to American laws around qualified immunity , it has become increasingly difficult to investigate and charge police misconduct and crimes. [175]
Likewise, some state and local jurisdictions, for example, Springfield, Illinois [176] have similar outside review organizations. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is investigated by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland , an external agency set up as a result of the Patten report into policing the province. In the Republic of Ireland the Garda Síochána is investigated by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission , an independent commission that replaced the Garda Complaints Board in May 2007.
The Special Investigations Unit of Ontario , Canada , is one of only a few civilian agencies around the world responsible for investigating circumstances involving police and others that have resulted in a death, serious injury, or allegations of sexual assault . The agency has made allegations of insufficient cooperation from various police services hindering their investigations. [177]
In Hong Kong , any allegations of corruption within the police are investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Independent Police Complaints Council , two agencies which are independent of the police force.
In the United States, body cameras are often worn by police officers to record their interactions with the public and each other, providing audiovisual recorded evidence for review in the event an officer or agency's actions are investigated. [178]
Use of force

Police forces also find themselves under criticism for their use of force, particularly deadly force . [179] Specifically, tension increases when a police officer of one ethnic group harms or kills a suspect of another one. [180] In the United States, such events occasionally spark protests and accusations of racism against police and allegations that police departments practice racial profiling . Similar incidents have also happened in other countries.
In the United States since the 1960s, concern over such issues has increasingly weighed upon law enforcement agencies, courts and legislatures at every level of government. Incidents such as the 1965 Watts riots , the videotaped 1991 beating by LAPD officers of Rodney King , and the riot following their acquittal have been suggested by some people to be evidence that U.S. police are dangerously lacking in appropriate controls.
The fact that this trend has occurred contemporaneously with the rise of the civil rights movement , the "" War on Drugs "", and a precipitous rise in violent crime from the 1960s to the 1990s has made questions surrounding the role, administration and scope of police authority increasingly complicated. [181]
Police departments and the local governments that oversee them in some jurisdictions have attempted to mitigate some of these issues through community outreach programs and community policing to make the police more accessible to the concerns of local communities, by working to increase hiring diversity, by updating training of police in their responsibilities to the community and under the law, and by increased oversight within the department or by civilian commissions.
In cases in which such measures have been lacking or absent, civil lawsuits have been brought by the United States Department of Justice against local law enforcement agencies, authorized under the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act . This has compelled local departments to make organizational changes, enter into consent decree settlements to adopt such measures, and submit to oversight by the Justice Department. [182]
In May 2020, a global movement to increase scrutiny of police violence grew in popularity, starting in Minneapolis , Minnesota with the murder of George Floyd . Calls for defunding of the police and full abolition of the police gained larger support in the United States as more criticized systemic racism in policing. [183]
Critics also argue that sometimes this abuse of force or power can extend to police officer civilian life as well. For example, critics note that women in around 40% of police officer families have experienced domestic violence [184] and that police officers are convicted of misdemeanors and felonies at a rate of more than six times higher than concealed carry weapon permit holders. [185]
Protection of individuals
The Supreme Court of the United States has consistently ruled that law enforcement officers in the U.S. have no duty to protect any individual, only to enforce the law in general. This is despite the motto of many police departments in the U.S. being a variation of ""protect and serve""; regardless, many departments generally expect their officers to protect individuals. The first case to make such a ruling was South v. State of Maryland in 1855, [186] and the most recent was Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales in 2005. [187]
In contrast, the police are entitled to protect private rights in some jurisdictions. To ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular competencies of the courts of law, some police acts require that the police may only interfere in such cases where protection from courts cannot be obtained in time, and where, without interference of the police, the realization of the private right would be impeded. [188] This would, for example, allow police to establish a restaurant guest's identity and forward it to the innkeeper in a case where the guest cannot pay the bill at nighttime because his wallet had just been stolen from the restaurant table.
In addition, there are federal law enforcement agencies in the United States whose mission includes providing protection for executives such as the president and accompanying family members, visiting foreign dignitaries, and other high-ranking individuals. [189] [ better source needed ] Such agencies include the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police .

Arunachal Pradesh
Tawang Monastery in Arunachal Pradesh
Arunachal Pradesh finds mention in the literature of Kalika Purana and Mahabharata. This place is supposed to be the Prabhu Mountains of the Puranas. It was here that sage Parashuram washed away his sin, sage Vyasa meditated, King Bhishmaka founded his kingdom and Lord Krishna married his consort Rukmini. The widely scattered archaeological remains at different places in Arunachal bears testimony to its rich cultural heritage.
There are places of worship and pilgrimage such as the Parasuramkund and the 400‑year‑old Tawang Monastery , or the sites of archaeological excavations like Malinithan and Itanagar , the natural environment of lakes such as Ganga lake or Sela lake or the numerous variations of the snow-clad silver mountain peaks and green meadows where thousands of species of flora and fauna prosper. In addition, the state provides abundant scope for angling, boating, rafting, trekking and hiking. Besides, there are a number of wild life sanctuaries and national parks with rare animals, birds and plants.
The climate varies from hot and humid to heavy rainfall in the Shivalik range. It becomes progressively colder as one moves northward to higher altitudes. Trees of great size, plentiful climbers and abundance of cane and bamboo make Arunachal evergreen.
Arunachal Pradesh is home to more than six hundred species of orchids , occurring in varying elevations and climatic conditions throughout the state.
Assam

Population
Warangal district, formerly Warangal Rural district,  is a district in the Indian state of Telangana . The district shares boundaries with Mahabubabad , Jangaon , Hanamkonda , Mulugu and Bhupalpally districts.
As of June 2021, Hanamkonda tentatively serves as the district headquarters of both Hanamkonda and Warangal districts. Warangal city is proposed to replace Hanamkonda as the new headquarters of the Warangal district. [3] [4]
The district was formed in 2016 by carving out Warangal Rural district from the erstwhile Warangal district. In August 2021, the Warangal Rural district was renamed back to Warangal district. Warangal and Khila Warangal mandals are transferred to the newly formed Warangal district. [5]
History
Warangal District 1905 to 1953
Warangal District With Talukas until 1979
Erstwhile Warangal district consisted of many prehistoric habitation sites, which were explored by the Indian archaeological authorities. Paleolithic Rock art paintings are found at Pandavula Gutta . [6] [7]
Padmakshi Gutta, a Jain temple dedicated to Padmavati located on a hilltop in the heart of the town of Hanamkonda , was originally constructed during the Kakatiya era. The temple has sculptures of Jain tirthankaras and other Jain gods and goddesses. The Kadalalaya basadi or Padmakshi Temple is built on a large rocky outcrop.[ citation needed ]
The Kakatiyas left many monuments, including impressive fortress, four massive stone gateways, the Swayambhu temple dedicated to Shiva , and the Ramappa temple situated near Ramappa Lake. Prominent rulers included Ganapathi Deva, Prathapa Rudra, and Rudrama Devi . After the defeat of Pratapa Rudra, the Musunuri Nayaks united 72 Nayak chieftains and captured Warangal from Delhi sultanate and ruled for fifty years. Jealousy and mutual rivalry between Nayaks ultimately led to the downfall of Hindus in 1370 and the rise of the Bahmani Sultanate .[ citation needed ]
The Bahmani Sultanate later broke up into several smaller sultanates , of which the Golconda sultanate ruled Warangal. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb conquered Golconda in 1687, and it remained part of the Mughal empire until the southern provinces of the empire split away to become the state of Hyderabad in 1724 which included the Telangana region and some parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka. Hyderabad became an Indian state in 1948. In 1956 Hyderabad was partitioned as part of the States Reorganisation Act , and Telangana, the Telugu -speaking region of Hyderabad state which includes Warangal, became part of Andhra Pradesh. After the bifurcation of the state of Andhra Pradesh, the district became a part of the new state of Telangana.
Formation of district
[ edit ]
During the rule of Nizam of Hyderabad , State of Hyderabad was divided into many small Circars. Warangal became a Circar in the early 1800s. [8] In 1866 Circars was Abolished and merged to create districts, Warangal district was created by merging Warungal, [9] Khummettu [10] and part of Bhonagheer circars. Jangaon area from Bhongir Circar was transferred to warangal and kamalpur area of warangal transferred to Karimnagra district.  In 1905 when Princely state of Hyderabad sub divided into Four Division namely 1.Aurangabad Division, 2.Gulbarga Division, 3.Gulshanabad Division, 4. Warangal Division . During formation divisions again districts were delimited in 1905 Jangaon(Cherial) Taluka and Kodar(Kodad) Sub Taluka transferred to Nalgonda District from Warangal district. [11] In 1905 AD, Warangal district was formed with Warangal, Pakala, Khammam, Yellandu, Mahabubabad, Madhira, Palvancha taluks and some area of old palvancha sanstan and some jagirs. This was bigger than many districts of Hyderabad state. [12]
Warangal district was divided to facilitate administrative control and on October 1, 1953, the Khmman district was formed. Khammam, Yellandu, Madhira, Burugunpahad and Palavancha talukas have been made part of it. Warangal, Mulugu, Mahaboobabad, Pakala remained in Warangal district. But Parkaala from Karimnagar and Jangaon from Nalgonda have become part of Warangal district. District uses to consist of 6 talukas and 2 revenue divisions which later increased to 15 talukas in 1979.  In 1985 when N. T. Rama Rao introduces mandal system in warangal district was divided in to 50 mandals, but again warangal mandal was curved out from Hanamkonda madal consisting only urban area of warangal which increased to total 51 mandals and revenue divisions increased to 5 in warangal district.
After formation of Telangana and as part of creation of new districts, initially Warangal Rural district was curved out from old Warangal district which split into 5 new districts they are Warangal urban, Warangal rural, Jangaon, Jayashanker and Mahabubabad in October 2016 along with other total new 33 districts. [13] However, on the demand of the public, the Warangal Rural and Warangal Urban districts were reorganised as Warangal district and Hanumakonda district with 13 and 14 mandals respectively vide GO.Ms.No. (Revenue (DA) Dept. on 12 August 2021.

Geography
The district is spread over an area of 2,175.50 square kilometres (839.97 sq mi). [14]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Kailashanatha Temple in Ellora Caves
Tourism in Marathwada refers to tourism in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra state in India. Aurangabad is a regional headquarters in Marathwada, and the tourism capital of Maharashtra state. [1] Out of the four UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Maharashtra, two are in the Marathwada region. [2] [3] [4] There are also 110 monuments in Marathwada which are protected by Government of Maharashtra and recognized by Archaeological Survey of India . [5]
Marathwada is also important region for religious tourism ; 3 of the 12 Hindu Jyotirlinga temples mentioned in the Shiva Purana are in Marathwada. [6] Hazur Sahib Nanded is the second holiest place in Sikhism after the Harminder Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar . [7] There are also Sufi shrines in Marathwada, the most famous among them being Turabul Haq Dargah at Parbhani , where thousands of people of all religions visit the dargah annually. [8] [9] [10] [11] [ unreliable source? ] [12] Pathri in Parbhani district is the birthplace of Sai Baba of Shirdi , and the Sai Baba Birth Temple is one of the major religious tourism places in Marathwada.
Caves
[ edit ]
The Marathwada region is home to a number of man-made cave temples, monuments, and historic sites.
Pitalkhora Caves – these colorful Buddhist caves are 17 km (11 mi) from Kannad Town. They were carved in the first century and is the first cave in Asia.[ citation needed ]
Rohilagad Caves – Rohilagad is 44 km (27 mi) from Aurangabad and 45 km (28 mi) from Jalna. These three caves date back to Satvahan yug, and many artworks were added to Rohilagad samrajya.[ clarification needed ] The sculptures of Rohilagad are considered masterpieces of Hindu religious art.
Ajanta Caves – a UNESCO World Heritage Sites that dates back to the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. During the Gupta period (5th and 6th centuries AD), many more richly decorated caves were added to the original group. The paintings and sculptures of Ajanta are considered masterpieces of Buddhist religious art. [3]
Ellora Caves – a UNESCO World Heritage Sites that dates back to 600–1000 AD. Its sanctuaries are devoted to Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. According to UNESCO, ""it illustrates the spirit of tolerance that was characteristic of ancient India"". [4]

Help:Category - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Category,"See also: Help:VisualEditor § Editing categories
A page becomes part of a category if the page's wiki markup contains a declaration for that category. A category declaration takes the form [[Category:Category name]] or [[Category:Category name|Sortkey]]. The declaration must be processed, i.e. it will not work if it appears between <nowiki>...</nowiki> or <includeonly>...</includeonly> tags, or in a comment. The declaration may however come from a transcluded page; see Categories and templates below.
A category name can be any string that would be a legitimate page title . If the category name begins with a lower-case letter, it will be capitalized. For initial lower-case letters, as in Category:macOS , see the technical restrictions page.
On Wikipedia, it is customary to place category declarations at the end of the wiki markup, but before any stub templates (which themselves transclude categories).
When a page has been added to one or more categories, a categories box appears at the bottom of the page (or possibly elsewhere, if a non-default skin is being used). This box contains a list of the categories the page belongs to, in the order in which the category declarations appear in the processed wiki markup. The category names are linked to the corresponding category pages. They appear as red links if the corresponding category page does not exist. If a user has enabled the HotCat gadget, the categories box will also provide links to quickly add, remove, or modify category declarations on the page, without having to edit the whole page.
Hidden categories are not displayed, except as described below under Hiding categories .
Working with category pages
The following subsections are ordered from simple actions to more elaborate or rarer actions.
Linking to category pages
To link to a category page without putting the current page in that category, precede the link with a colon: [[:Category:Category name]]. Such a link can be piped like a normal wikilink. (The {{ cl }} template, and others listed on its documentation page, may sometimes be helpful.)
Retrieving raw category information
Raw information about the members of a category, their sort keys and timestamps (time when last added to the category) can be obtained from the API , using a query of the form:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?cmtitle=Category:Category_name&action=query&list=categorymembers&cmlimit=500&cmprop=title|sortkey|timestamp
Listings of up to 500 members are possible. If there are more members then the results will include text near the end like this: <categorymembers cmcontinue=""page|NNNN|TITLE"" />.
This can be added to the previous one, without quotation marks, for the next page of members: ...&cmcontinue=page|NNNN|TITLE
Sorting category pages
WP:SORTCAT
By default, a page is sorted under the first character of its name, without the namespace. English Wikipedia groups accented characters together with their unaccented version, so pages starting with À, Á, Ä, will be listed under heading A. Sorting is case-insensitive, so ""ABC"" comes after ""Abacus"".
Unlike at Special:Allpages and Special:Prefixindex , a space is treated as a space (coming before all other characters), not as an underscore.
The English Wikipedia has numerical sorting in categories . This means that digit sequences in page names are treated according to their numerical value, not as strings. Thus ""9 dogs"", ""25 dogs"", and ""112 dogs"" will all appear under the ""0–9"" heading in numerical order, and V838 Monocerotis will appear before V1309 Scorpii .
Each of the three lists (subcategories, pages, media files) is arranged in the order explained above (except that, in the subcategories list, the namespace indicator ""Category:"" is not considered). If an item ought to be positioned within a list on the basis of an alternative name (sort key) for that item, then this can be specified in the category tag that places the item in the list:
[[Category:Category name|Sortkey]]
For example, to add an article called Albert Einstein to Category:1879 births and have the article sorted by ""Einstein, Albert"", you would type:
[[Category:1879 births|Einstein, Albert]]
Unlike a piped link (which uses the same syntax), the sort key itself is not displayed to readers. It affects only the order in which pages are listed on the category page.
It is useful to document the system being used for sort keys on the category page. For guidelines about the use of sort keys on Wikipedia, see WP:SORTKEY .
Default sort key
WP:DEFAULTSORT
This section documents functionality. For guidelines, see WP:NAMESORT and WP:SORTKEY .
It is possible to set a default sort key which is different from {{PAGENAME}} by using the magic word {{DEFAULTSORT:}}:
{{DEFAULTSORT:new key}}
This is often used in biography articles, to make sure the subject is sorted by their last name:
{{DEFAULTSORT:LastName, FirstName}}
For example, on the Albert Einstein page, {{DEFAULTSORT:Einstein, Albert}} adds the sort key ""Einstein, Albert"" to all his categories, such as Category:1879 births .
In the case of multiple default sort key tags, the last DEFAULTSORT on the final rendering of a page applies for all categories, regardless of the position of the category tags. This also means that a DEFAULTSORT tag included from a template is not effective if another DEFAULTSORT tag occurs later on the page, even if the later DEFAULTSORT tag is also ""hidden"" (included by another template).
Searching for pages in categories
See also: Wikipedia:Category intersection
In addition to browsing through hierarchies of categories, it is possible to use the search tool to find specific articles in specific categories. To search for articles in a specific category, type incategory:""CategoryName"" in the search box.
A pipe ""|"" can be added to join the contents of one category with the contents of another. For example, enter
incategory:""Suspension bridges|Bridges in New York City""
to return all pages that belong to either (or both) of the categories, as here .
Note that using search to find categories will not find articles which have been categorized using templates. This feature also doesn't return pages in subcategories.
Listing all categories
Special:Categories provides an alphabetic list of all categories, with the number of members of each; this number does not include the content of the subcategories, but it includes the subcategories themselves, i.e., each counting as one.
The above list contains all categories that have members, regardless of whether they have corresponding category pages. To list all existing category pages (regardless of whether they have members), use Special:AllPages/Category: .
Displaying category trees and page counts
As described at mw:Help:Magic words , {{PAGESINCATEGORY:Example}} or {{PAGESINCAT:Example}} returns the number of pages in ""Category:Example"". Each subcategory counts as one page; pages in subcategories are not counted.
The page Special:CategoryTree enables you to see the tree structure of a category (its subcategories, their subcategories and so on; the display of files and other member pages is optional).
The CategoryTree extension can be used to display such a tree on any page. (This is sometimes done on the category page itself, if the category is split over multiple screens, to make all subcategories available on every screen.) The basic syntax is
<categorytree>Category name</categorytree>
to display just the subcategory tree, and
<categorytree mode=pages>Category name</categorytree>
to display member pages as well. They will be indicated by italics.
Dapete's category-visualizer vCat will render charts of the tree structure.
You may also use Template:Category tree or Template:Category tree all , instead.
Warning:
The following code {{PAGESINCATEGORY:{{PAGENAME}}}} will not work as expected when used in the wikitext or in a transcluded template in a category page whose title contains some ASCII punctuations.
For legacy reasons, {{PAGENAME}} may return the page name with these characters being HTML-encoded using numeric character entities : this still works for generating derived wikilinks or displaying page names, or when HTML-encoded this page name is used in a conditional ""#switch"", but PAGESINCATEGORY does not recognize the category name given in parameter if some characters are HTML-encoded (this is the case notably when the category name contains ASCII apostrophes ' and a few other ASCII punctuations. (The same HTML-encoding is also applied to the values returned by {{FULLPAGENAME}}, {{SUBPAGENAME}}, or {{NAMESPACE}}).
In that case, as the category is not found by its HTML-encoded pagename, PAGESINCATEGORY will unexpectedly return 0 and not its effective number of member pages.
A simple workaround is to transform these HTML-encoded characters back into standard UTF-8-encoded characters, by using the {{titleparts:}} parser function, like this:
{{PAGESINCATEGORY:{{titleparts:{{PAGENAME}}}}}}
Moving and redirecting category pages
Categories can be moved in the same way as an ordinary page; but a certain amount of cleanup may be necessary. A redirect is left at the old category name, and this is not a normal #REDIRECT [[...]] but a {{ category redirect }}. Once all the pages have been moved out of the old category, it may be left as a category redirect or deleted. For categories entirely populated through templates (see above), modifying the templates enables all affected articles to be moved to another category, but with the refresh problem mentioned. Almost all category name changes are made pursuant to a consensus decision at Wikipedia:Categories for discussion .
Do not create intercategory redirects other than with a {{ category redirect }} template. See Wikipedia:Categories for discussion § Redirecting categories for more on category redirects.
Hiding categories
When the magic word __HIDDENCAT__ is placed on a category page, that category becomes hidden, meaning that it will not be displayed on the pages belonging to that category. On Wikipedia, the magic word is not normally used explicitly, but is applied through the {{ hidden category }} template. The feature is mostly used to prevent project maintenance categories from showing up to ordinary readers on article pages.
For users who are not logged in , hidden categories are displayed on category pages (whether as parent categories or subcategories).
Hidden categories are displayed at the bottom of each page, after ""Hidden categories:"", for registered users:
at preview during editing;
if the user has selected ""Show hidden categories"" in their user preferences.
Hidden categories are automatically added to Category:Hidden categories .
For guidelines on the hiding of categories on Wikipedia, see WP:HIDDENCAT .
Tracking categories
Tracking categories are used to track technical featues or problems. They are outside of the category structure for articles. Pages may be inserted into those by the MediaWiki software, or by templates or modules. Usually they are hidden, or even red ie not created. Special:TrackingCategories lists all tracking categories populated the MediaWiki software. Category:Tracking categories is the top for tracking categories on this wiki.
Finding articles for a category
The most effective way of finding entries of a category is using the "" What links here "" tool on the category's main article.
An easy way to find relevant articles for a new category or missing entries in an existing one is by finding the most relevant list and checking its entries. Sometimes categories are about things that are intersections of other categories for which the PetScan tool can be used.
More relevant articles may also be found linked in a category's main article and the articles already featured in the category − especially in their ""See also"" sections (if existent) and the automatically suggested ""RELATED ARTICLES"" below them.
Furthermore, a category's superordinate categories often feature articles that should be subcategorized to the category.
Other ways to find relevant articles include searching Wikipedia for the category's topic and searching the Web for the topic in quotes "" (with synonyms also in quotes and appended after an OR) and appending the word wiki or Wikipedia or site:Wikipedia.org to them.
Categorizing
Main page: Wikipedia:Categorization
Categorizing templates
Templates are categorized the same way as articles, except that [[Category: Some-topic templates]] should be placed on the template's documentation page (or inside <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags, if there is no documentation page), this is necessary to avoid categorizing pages by template inclusion (see below).
Categories and templates
A template can be used to add pages to a category, usually by placing the category link inside <includeonly></includeonly> tags on the template (e.g. <includeonly>[[Category:category name]]</includeonly>).  When the template is transcluded into the page, the category link becomes active, and the page is added to the category page.  This is useful for categories that have high turnover or many pages included, like cleanup categories.
Changes to the template, however, may not be reflected immediately on the category page.  When you edit an article to add a category tag directly, the list of category members is updated immediately when the page is saved.  When a category link is contained in a template, however, this does not happen immediately: instead, whenever a template is edited, all the pages that transclude it are put into the job queue to be recached during periods of low server load. This means that, in busy periods, it may take hours or even days before individual pages are recached and they start to appear in the category list. Performing a null edit to a page will allow it to jump the queue and be immediately recached.
To add the template itself to the category page as well, omit the ""includeonly"" tags. To add the template to a category without categorizing pages on which the template is transcluded, place the category declaration between <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags, or add it to the template documentation page between <includeonly></includeonly> (the latter allows recategorizing the template without editing it, which is helpful if it is protected, or so complicated that mere mortals hesitate to touch it).
Parser functions can be used to make the transcluded categories, or the sort key used in them, dependent on other variables, notably PAGENAME.
Passing a category name as a parameter
<includeonly>[[Category:{{{cat|default}}}]]</includeonly> or <includeonly>{{{cat|[[Category:default]]}}}</includeonly>If the user provides a parameter 'cat=XXX' the page will be categorized at the page [[Category:XXX]], otherwise it will be categorized at the page [[Category:default]]. Calling the template with ""cat="" (equal to nothing) disables putting the page in any category.
Excluding non-article pages
<includeonly>{{#if:{{NAMESPACE}} | | [[Category:XXX]]}}</includeonly>the variable NAMESPACE is null for mainspace articles.  For any space other than mainspace, this ParserFunction will produce an empty string, but for regular articles this will include the article in Category:XXX.
On Wikipedia it is not recommended that templates be used to populate ordinary content categories of articles. See Categorization using templates in the categorization guideline.
Categorizing redirect pages
Main page: Wikipedia:Categorizing redirects
Redirect pages can be categorized and there are conventions on how to do it. The redirect link must be first on the page. On a category page, redirects are listed in italics.
""Related Changes"" with categories
For a category, the "" Related Changes "" feature, when applied to the corresponding category page, lists recent changes to the pages which are currently listed as belonging to a category. Where those pages are subcategories or image pages, only changes to their editable parts are listed.
Notice that ""Related Changes"" does not show edits to pages that have been removed from the category.
Also, ""Related Changes"" does not list recent changes to pages linked from the editable part of the category page (as it would normally, with a non-category page). If a workaround would be required, the links in question could be placed in a template and transcluded onto the category page.
As usual – unlike with watchlists – recent changes to corresponding talk pages are not shown under ""Related Changes"". Pages one is watching are bolded on the list. This can help to find which pages in a given category one has on one's watchlist.
The DynamicPageList (third-party) extension provides a list of last edits to the pages in a category, or optionally, just the list of pages; the simpler DynamicPageList (Wikimedia) is installed on Meta, Wikinews, Wikibooks and Wikiversity; the extension mw:Extension:DPLforum is installed on Wikia.
Watching category additions and removals
Since 2016 , additions and removals from categories are available via the ""Category changes"" filter on recent changes pages, including watchlists and Special:RecentChangesLinked . For example, category changes to articles in Category:Cannabis stubs can be found here . You can monitor additions and removals from specific categories by adding the categories to your watchlist and making sure the ""Category changes"" filter is active. You can view changes to categories in your watchlist by clicking here . Additional scripts with similar functionality are User:CategoryWatchlistBot and User:Ais523/catwatch .

In October 2013, India decided to initiate the process of extending visa-on-arrival access to 40 more nations. [42] In January 2014, plans were confirmed by Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and Planning of India . [43] The sixteen different types of visa would also be reduced to three: work, business and tourism. [44] The proposal initially met resistance from intelligence agencies and the possible problem of queues emerged. [45] [46]
2014
[ edit ]
In February 2014 it was announced that Indian intelligence agencies had given their approval to visa-on-arrival for up to 180 countries, largely due to the new possibilities provided by the Immigration, Visa and Foreigners' Registration and Tracking (IVFRT) system. The system would not be a typical visa on arrival in order to avoid clutter at the airports, but a system based on a prior online application modelled after Australian Electronic Travel Authority system. [47] [48] [49]
On 5 February 2014 it was decided to introduce visa-on-arrival to tourists from 180 countries. Technical implementation, such as setting up the website for applications, was expected to take about 6 months and the authorities hoped to have it in place for the tourist season beginning in October 2014. Prospective visitors would have to pay a fee and the electronic version of the visa should be granted within three days. The program was expected to apply to all international airports. However, nationals of Afghanistan , Iran , Iraq , Nigeria , Pakistan , Somalia , Sudan were to be excluded from this program. [50]

Once, this northeastern state of India was known as Pragjyotishpura , then Kamrupa . During Ahom rule the land was called Axom, which foreigners pronounced ""Assam"". Assam was ruled by many kingdoms from ancient times. In 1826, British took over Assam and made it a separate state. From ancient times, tourists have come to this land. The Chinese traveler Xuanzang visited Kamrupa during Bhaskarvarman in the 7th century.
In 1958, the Department of Tourism was established. In 1962, an information office opened in Kaziranga , and in 1965, an information office opened in Sivasagar . [4]
In 1987 (during the seventh Five Year Plan), the first ever tourism policy of Assam was notified and subsequently ATDC was formed with a paid up capital of 24 lakh. In the same year the state government declared tourism as an industry. [4]
In the mid-70s, Assam tourism started properties near Kaziranga and other places such as Aranya, Banani, Banashree, MV and Jolporee. After the creation of ATDC, some of them were handed over to ATDC to operate. From the beginning, ATDC created many tourist lodges, yatriniwas, parks, and wayside amenities with the brand name of ""Prashaanti"". In 2009, a ""tourist arrival cum reception center"" was opened in Guwahati, which is presently known as ""Asom Paryatan Bhawan"". In 2012, ATDC started a luxury cruise, MV Mahabaahu, in a joint venture. [5]
In 1995 the Restricted Area Permit (RAP) from Assam was withdrawn which had been imposed in 1962 after Chinese attack. [4]
Properties
[ edit ]
Assam tourism has more than 50 properties including lodges, wayside amenities, restaurants, parks, rope ways, amusement parks, and cruises in locations across Assam. Out of these, the Directorate of Tourism runs eight lodges. ATDC operates directly seven lodges, and other properties are on lease to private parties. [6]

Sacred groves of India
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Forest fragments of varying sizes

Sacred groves of India are forest fragments of varying sizes, which are communally protected, and which usually have a significant religious connotation for the protecting community. Hunting and logging are usually strictly prohibited within these patches. [1] Other forms of forest usage like honey collection and deadwood collection are sometimes allowed on a sustainable basis. NGOs work with local villagers to protect such groves. Traditionally, and in some cases even today, members of the community take turns to protect the grove. [2] The introduction of the protected area category community reserves under the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2002 has introduced legislation for providing government protection to community held lands, which could include sacred groves.
Around 14,000 sacred groves have been reported across India, which act as reservoirs of rare fauna, and more often rare flora, amid rural and even urban settings. Experts believe that the total number of sacred groves could be as high as 100,000. Threats to the groves include urbanization, and over-exploitation of resources. While many of the groves are looked upon as abodes of Hindu deities , in the recent past a number of them have been partially cleared for construction of shrines and temples. [3] [4] Sacred groves are places of yatra (pilgrimage) in Indian-origin religions , such as Hinduism , Buddhism , Jainism and Sikhism .
Indian sacred groves are often associated with temples , monasteries , shrines , pilgrimage sites , or with burial grounds. Historically, sacred groves find their mention in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist texts, from sacred tree groves in Hinduism to sacred bamboo groves and sacred deer parks in Buddhism for example. [5] Sacred groves may be loosely used to refer to natural habitat protected on religious grounds. Other historical references to sacred groves can be obtained in Vrukshayurveda an ancient treatise, ancient classics such as Kalidasa 's Vikramuurvashiiya . There has been a growing interest in creating green patches such as Nakshatravana grove.
Uses of sacred groves
[ edit ]
One of the most important traditional uses of sacred groves was that it acted as a repository for various Ayurvedic medicines. Other uses involved a source of replenishable resources like fruits and honey. In most  sacred groves it was taboo to hunt or chop wood. The vegetation cover helps reduce soil erosion and prevents desertification as in Rajasthan . The groves are often associated with ponds and streams, and meet water requirements of local communities. They sometimes help in recharging aquifers as well.
Modern uses
[ edit ]
In modern times, sacred groves have become biodiversity hotspots , as various species seek refuge in the areas due to progressive habitat destruction and hunting elsewhere. Sacred groves often contain plant and animal species that have become extinct in neighboring areas. They therefore harbor great genetic diversity. Besides this, sacred groves in urban landscapes act as ""lungs"" to the city as well, providing much needed vegetation cover.
Religious beliefs and practices

Typically, sacred groves in Indian-origin religions are associated with the concept of a presiding deity. Often these sacred deities are numerous nature spirits and guardians associated with Hindu , Jain and Buddhist deities, such as nature spirits known as Yakshas (numerous nature spirits), Nāgas (serpent guardians) and guardian tutelary deities (like ayyanar and amman) are also known. There are over 1000 deities associated with sacred groves in the states of Kerala and Karnataka alone. A large number of distinct local art forms and folk traditions are associated with the deities of sacred groves, and are an important cultural aspect closely associated with sacred traditions. Ritualistic dances and dramatizations based on the local deities that protect the groves are called Theyyam in Kerala and Nagmandalam, among other names, in Karnataka . Often, elaborate rituals and traditions are associated with sacred groves, [6] as are associated folk tales and folk mythology.
Types of sacred forests
[ edit ]
The Hindu tradition considers forests to be of three types - Tapovan, Mahavan and Sreevan. Tapovan are forests associated with penance (Tapas), and are inhabited by saints and rishis. Mahavan refers to the grand natural forests. Tapovan and Mahavan are considered to be a Raksha (""sanctuary"") for flora and fauna as ordinary human beings are not allowed to enter these forests. Sreevan, which means, ""forests of the goddess of prosperity"", consists of dense forests and groves. From the former, people would collect dry wood, leaves, forest produce and a limited amount of timber, though natural ecosystem would not be unnecessarily disturbed. Groves were considered as spaces of forests from where harvesting could be done. Sometimes, specific trees like mango trees could be planted and nurtured here. Groves were associated with religious rites, festivals and recreation. Typical recreational activities associated with these groves included jhoola/ jhoolan. [7] In the villages, Panchavati, or a cluster of five trees that represented the forests, were maintained. These trees represented the five elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space. [7]
Religious merits of planting and nurturing forests
[ edit ]
Planting and nurturing of trees had been a highly evolved practice in ancient India. [8] Vrukshayurveda, the science of plant life and also a 10th-century treatise of that title on the subject ascribed to Surapala, dealt with various species of trees and their growth. Verses 9-23 from this text indicate how mystical beliefs and conservation of ecology was inter-connected.
A person is honored in Vaikuntha for as many thousand years as the days they reside in a house where tulasi is grown.
And if one properly grows bilva , which pleases Lord Siva , in their family, the goddess of riches resides permanently passes on to the sons and grandsons
One who plants even a single asvattha , wherever it may be, as per the prescribed mode, goes to the abode of Hari.
One who has planted dhatri has performed several sacrifices. They has donated the earth. They would be considered a liberated soul forever.
One who plants a couple of banyan trees as per the prescribed mode would go to the abode of Siva.
After planting neem trees a person well-versed in dharma attains the abode of Sun. Indeed! One resides there for a long period.
By planting four plaksa trees a person doubtlessly obtains the fruits of Rajasuya sacrifice.
One who plants five or six mango trees attains the abode of Garuda and lives happily forever like gods.
One should plant seven palasa trees or even one. One attains the abode of Brahma and enjoys the company of gods by doing so.
One who personally plants eight udumbara trees or even prompts someone to plant them, rejoices in the lunar world
One who has planted madhuka has propitiated Parvati , has become free from diseases, and has worshipped all deities.
If one plants ksirini, dadimi, rambha, priyala , and panasa, one experiences no affliction for seven births.
One who has knowingly or unknowingly planted ambu is respected as a recluse even while staying in the house.
By planting all kinds of other trees, useful for fruits and flowers, a person gets a reward of thousand cows adorned with jewels.
By planting one asvattha, one picumanda, one nyagrodha , ten tamarind trees, the group of three, viz., kapittha, bilva , and amalaka, and five mango trees, one never visits hell. [8]
Locations of sacred groves
Deodar Devban grove in Himachal Pradesh, India
Distribution of sacred groves in India
[ edit ]
Sacred groves are scattered all over the country, and are referred to by different names in different parts of India. Sacred groves occur in a variety of places – from scrub forests in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan maintained by the Bishnois , to rain forests in the Western Ghats of Kerala . Himachal Pradesh in the north and Kerala in the south are specifically known for their large numbers of sacred groves. [9] The Gurjar people of Rajasthan have a unique practice of neem (Azadirachta indica) planting and worshipping as abode of God Devnarayan . Thus, a Gurjjar settlement appears like a human-inhabited sacred grove. [10] Similarly Mangar Bani , last surviving natural forest of Delhi is protected by Gurjars of nearby area. [11] 14,000 sacred groves have been reported from all over India, which act as reservoirs of rare fauna, and more often rare flora, amid rural and even urban settings. Experts believe that the total number of sacred groves could be as high as 100,000. [12] [4]
It is estimated that around 1000 km2 of unexploited land is inside sacred groves. Some of the more famous groves are the kavus of Kerala, which are located in the Western Ghats and have enormous biodiversity; and the law kyntangs of Meghalaya – sacred groves associated with every village (two large groves being in Mawphlang [13] and Mausmai) to appease the forest spirit.
Summary of number of sacred groves by states in India
[ edit ]
Among the largest sacred groves of India are the ones in Hariyali, near Gauchar in Chamoli District of Uttarakhand , and the Deodar grove in Shipin near Simla in Himachal Pradesh . Seeing the importance of sacred groves and other sacred natural sites in having conserved biodiversity all across the Himalayas, the intergovernmental organization ICIMOD developed and published a framework in 2016, to assess the present day significance of such sites for their integration into formal conservation and development frameworks. [14]
All numbers are quoted from the records of the C.P.R. Environmental Education Centre of the Government of India. Starred numbers are likely to increase. The centre also maintains a complete list of identified sacred groves in India, most of which is online. [15]

Capital
Pallava Dynasty
The Vishnukundina dynasty ( IAST : Viṣṇukuṇḍina, sometimes Viṣukuṇḍin) was an Indian dynasty that ruled over parts of present-day Andhra Pradesh , Telangana , Odisha , and other parts of southern India between the 5th and 7th centuries. They emerged as an independent power during the reign of Madhava Varma, who conquered coastal Andhra from the Salankayanas and established their capital at Denduluru near Eluru . Their rule significantly shaped the history of the Deccan region. However, their reign ended with the conquest of eastern Deccan by the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II , who appointed his brother, Kubja Vishnuvardhana , as viceroy. Vishnuvardhana later declared independence, founding the Eastern Chalukya dynasty.
Name of the Dynasty
[ edit ]
The dynasty is usually referred to as the Viṣṇukuṇḍins, but the question was reviewed by S. Sankaranarayanan who closely examined the philogical evidence and concluded that Vishṇukuṇḍi was the gramattically correct form of the name. [2] Although this is technically correct, historians continue to use Viṣukuṇḍin because it is well established in the literature, having been used by K. A. Nilakanta Sastri and Dineshchandra Sircar . [3]
Origin
[ edit ]
The early rulers of the dynasty migrated from eastern Deccan to the west Deccan in search of employment and under the Vakatakas they might have attained feudatory status. [4]
During the reign of Madhava Varma, they became independent and conquered coastal Andhra from the Salankayanas and established their capital at Denduluru [5] near Eluru , West Godavari district . Some modern historians from Telangana suggest that the dynasty initially ruled from Indrapalanagara (in present-day Nalgonda district of Telangana), and later shifted to Denduluru , and Amaravathi . [6]
Chronology
[ edit ]
The Vishnukundina reign might be fixed between the end of the Salankayana and the rise of the Eastern Chalukyan power in 624. Some historians mention Vishnukundinas' reign was from 420 to 624, while some other historians say their reign was from the early 5th century to the 7th century.
Govinda Varma I
Govinda Varma I took the princely title of Maharaja and his son Madhava Varma I was the founder of the power based on grants from Sriparvata (Nagarjunakonda) and Indrapalagutta. [7]
Madhava Varma I
The reign of Madhava Varma (c. 420 – c. 455). He was the founder of the Vishnukundina power.
Madhava Varma II
[ edit ]
Madhava Varma II was the most powerful ruler of Vishnukundina dynasty. The reign of Madhava Varma II ( c. 440 – c. 460) was a golden age in the history of the Vishnukundinas. The Vishnukundina dynasty reached its greatest territorial extent under Madhava Varma II. He defeated Prithvishena II, the powerful ruler of Vakataka dynasty . Vakataka Mahadevi, the daughter of Prithvishena II, was given in marriage to him.
By the middle of the 5th century, the dynasty rose to imperial heights. A princess of the then powerful ruling family of the Deccan the Vakatakas was given in marriage to Madhava Varma's son, Vikramendra Varma.
This alliance enabled them to extend their influence to the east coast and vanquish the petty chieftains lingering on in that area. Madhava Varma II led his arms against Ananda Gotrikas who were ruling over Guntur , Tenali and Ongole , probably enjoying subordinate position under the Pallavas of Kanchipuram .
After occupying these areas from the Ananda Gotrikas, Madhava Varma II made Amarapura (modern Amaravati ) his capital. Keeping in view the constant threat from the Pallavas , he created an outpost to check their activities and appointed his son, Deva Varma and after his death the grandson Madhava Varma III as its Viceroy .
Undavalli Caves, Vijayawada, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh
Madhava Varma II next turned his attention against the Vengi kingdom which was under the Salankayanas . The Vengi region was annexed. The Godavari tract became part of the Vishnukundina territory. After these conquests the capital might have been shifted to Bezwada ( Vijayawada ), a more central location than Amarapura. These extensive conquests made him the lord of Dakshinapatha (southern country). After these various conquests Madhava Varma performed many Asvamedha , Rajasuya and other Vedic sacrifices .
Successors of Madhava Varma II
[ edit ]
The fortunes of the Vishnukundinas were at a low point during the reign of the next ruler Vikramendra Varma I (508–528). The next two and half decades also experienced the constant strife and dynastic struggles during the reign of Indra Bhattaraka Varma (528–555). Though Indra Bhattaraka could not withstand the hostile Kalinga subordinate, Indra Varma and lost his life in battle. The Vishnukundinas lost their Kalinga possessions north of the Godavari.
Vikramendra Varma II
[ edit ]
With the accession of Vikramendra Varma II (555–569), the fortunes of the Vishnukundina family were restored. To have immediate access to the Kalinga region, he shifted his capital from Bezwada to Lenduluru (modem Denduluru in the West Godavari district ). He repulsed the attack of the Pallava ruler Simhavarman. He was successful enough to restore the fortunes of the Vishnukundinas in the Kalinga region. His son Govinda Varma II enjoyed a comparatively short period of rule (569–573).
Janassraya Madhava Varma IV
[ edit ]
The Vishnukundina empire set about again to imperial expansion and cultural prosperity under its able ruler Janassraya Madhava Varma IV (573–621). This prudent king spent his early years of rule in consolidating his position in Vengi. The later part of his reign is marked by wars and annexations. In his 37th regnal year, he suppressed the revolt of his subordinate chief the Durjaya Pruthvi Maharaja in Guddadivishya (modern Ramachandrapuram in the East Godavari district).
Madhava Varma IV had to face the Chalukyan onslaught in his last years of rule. By about 616, Pulakeshin II and his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana conquered Vengi from the Vishnukundinas and the Pithapuram area from their subordinate Durjayas. In 621 in his 48th regnal year, Madhava crossed the Godavari probably to oust the Chalukyas from his territories. However, he lost his life on the battlefield. His son Manchana Bhattaraka also might have been expelled by the Chalukyas. Thus the Vishnukundina rule was brought to a close by 624.
Greatly reduced Vishnukundina territory in 600 AD, along with the Chalukyas advancing at their border
Vishnukundina country
They had three important cities, Indrapalanagara, Denduluru , and Amaravati .
Administration
For administrative convenience, the empire was divided into a number of Rashtras and Vishayas . Inscriptions refer to Palki Rashtra, Karma Rashtra, Guddadi Vishaya, etc.[ citation needed ]
Madhava Varma III appointed members of the royal family as Viceroys for various areas of the kingdom.
The king was the highest court of appeal in the administrator of justice. The Vishnukundina rulers established various kinds of punishments for various crimes. They were known for their impartial judgment and high sense of justice.
Army
Their army consisted of traditional fourfold divisions:
Elephants
Cavalry
Infantry
The Hastikosa was the officer-in-charge of elephant forces and the Virakosa was the officer-in-charge of land forces.
These officers also issued grants on behalf of their monarchs.
Taxes
[ edit ]
Vishnukundina Empire, 420–674 AD, Cast Copper, 7.80g, Vidarbha (Maharashtra), Lion type.
There may have been well-organized administrative machinery for the collection of land revenue.[ citation needed ] Agrahara villages enjoyed tax exemptions. Sixteen types of coins of the Vishnukundina rulers have been found by archaeologists.
Religion
[ edit ]
All the records of the Vishnukundinas and the kings prior to the Madhava Varma II seem to be patrons of Hinduism .
From the time of the accession of Madhava Varma II, an aggressive self-assertion[ citation needed ] of the Vedic Hinduism occurred. Elaborate Vedic ceremonies like Rajasuya , Sarvamedha , and Aswamedha were undertaken. The celebration of all these sacrifices represents the traditional spirit of the Brahmanical revival[ citation needed ]. Some of the rulers referred to themselves as 'Parama Mahesvaras'. The inscriptions refer to their family deity Sri Parvata Swami.[ citation needed ]
The names of rulers like Madhava Varma and Govinda Varma show their Vaishnavite leanings. Thus both the Hindu sects of Saivism and Vaishnavism might have received equal patronage from them.
Literature
[ edit ]
Old Telugu Script – Vishnukundina Indra Varma Sasanam 6th century
The Vishnukundinas were also great patrons of learning. They established colleges for Vedic learning. Learned Brahmins were encouraged by gifts of lands and colleges were established for the propagation of Vedic studies. Indra Bhattaraka established many schools for imparting education on Vedic literature. The performance of several elaborate Vedic ceremonies by Madhava Varma is evidence of the faith of the rulers in Vedic Hinduism and the popularity of Vedic learning with the people during this period.
Some of the Vishnukundina kings were credited with authorship of several books. Vikramendra Varma I was described as Mahakavi – a great poet in a record.  Further, an incomplete work on Sanskrit poetics called 'Janasraya Chando Vichiti' was attributed to Madhava Varma IV who bore the title of 'Janasraya'. Sanskrit enjoyed royal patronage.
Art and Architecture
[ edit ]
Being great devotees of Siva , the Vishnukundinas seem to have been responsible for the construction of a number of cave temples dedicated to Siva. The cave structures at Bezwada ( Vijayawada ), Mogalrajapuram, Undavalli caves , and Bhairavakonda were dated to this period. Though some of these cave temples were attributed to the Pallava Mahendra Varman I, the emblems found on the caves and the areas being under the rule of the Vishnukundinas during this period clearly show that these were contributions of the Vishnukundinas. The big four-storeyed cave at Undavalli and the 8 cave temples in Bhairavakonda in Nellore district show however clear resemblances with the architecture of Pallava Mahendra Varman's period.

Tourism in Ladakh
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Ladakh landscape
Leh Palace, Leh, Ladakh
Tourism is  one of the economic contributors to the union territory of Ladakh in Northern India . This union territory is located between the Karakoram mountain range to the north and the Himalayas to the south, and is situated at a height of 11,400 ft. Ladakh is composed of Leh and Kargil districts. The region contains prominent Buddhist sites and has an ecotourism industry.
Inner Line Permits
[ edit ]
Farming in Leh Valley, Ladakh.
There are no open border crossings to the neighbouring Tibet Autonomous Region and Xinjiang , administered by China, or to Gilgit-Baltistan , administered by Pakistan.
No special permit is required to visit most of Ladakh, including Leh and Kargil towns.
Inner Line Permit (ILP), which can be obtained online, are required for all tourists to visit the ""Inner Line"" areas, the geostrategic restricted military border areas, such as Nubra Valley ; Pangong Tso and Durbuk block (north of the Chang La pass); Tso-Moriri and Tso Kar lakes; Dah and Hanu villages; areas along the Indus River northwest of Khalatse and east of Upshi .
Foreigners can also obtain the permits for the restricted border areas, except they are not permitted in the specific border areas. Permits for foreigners are not available to go to the far reaches of each of the areas close to the LOC and LAC borders with Pakistan and China respectively. For example, foreigners can go to the edge of Pangong Lake and Maan and Merak villages, but not along the edge of it to Phobrang or Chushul villages; they cannot proceed east up the Indus from the Mahe bridge; and in Nubra they can only go as far as Panamik to the north and Turtuk to the west.

The area thrives on donations made by tourists and the local people of the region but now the government plans to develop these monasteries. The state government also plans to hire experts for landscaping of the barren regions and such a move was possible only after the Centre released funds. [29] [30]

Sankoo is 42 km from Kargil, then the Barsoo road further 4.6 km leads east to the statue on the road side in Khartse Khar village on the bank of Suru River . ""The holes around it suggested that scaffolding had been used to reach the face and carve out the finer details. The Buddha formed an abhayamudrā (gesture of fearlessness) with his right hand, while the left hand carried a kamandal (pot to carry water). I noticed a rudraksha mala (prayer beads) tied around the wrist and the arm, as well as the janeu (sacred thread) and the karadhani (waist chain), also made out of rudraksha. Although knotted, the statue’s hair fell over his shoulders."" [34] [35]

Petroglyphs in Ladakh, India
Ladakh has several petroglyphs dating back 5000 years to Iron Age , Bronze Age , Kushan period (30–375 CE), and as recent as 15th century. [40] [41] [42] French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) has found several thousand rock paintings across more than 400 rock carving sites. [41]
""Rock art in Ladakh comprises carvings or incisions on rock surfaces that are called petroglyphs which display a very wide range of themes and motifs, and provide crucial information about Ladakh’s prehistory about which very little is yet known, The rock art of Ladakh, whilst concentrated around the Indus River and its tributaries, is represented in all parts of Ladakh and Kargil districts, including Zanskar, Changthang and Nubra. However, the rock art of Ladakh at several locations is under severe risk of damage and outright destruction though road, housing and other development projects, and we are confident that the establishment of RAU will play a key role with other interested organisations, to create local community level awareness and ownership of this precious cultural heritage.""

Pune is the second largest city of Maharashtra state, India and is surrounded by the Sahyadri Mountain range . It occupied an important place during the Maratha Empire between 1674 and 1881. Hence, it homes numerous forts and wadas highlighting typical Maratha architecture. [1] Forts are one of the main attractions including Lohagad and Visapur Forts. It also has rich cultural and spiritual history with many temples and ashrams spread across the city. In additional to local adventure and history junkies, Pune also attracts many international tourist because of Osho International Meditation Resort that is located in heart of Pune at Koregaon Park . [2] [3]

Forts
[ edit ]
Lohagad and Visapur Forts are located about 65 km to the west of Pune. The forts were primarily built to boost trade by safeguarding the important trade route through Bhor Ghat. The forts can be easily reached by roadways or railways. Trains are available from Pune to Malavali Railway Station, which is the nearest railways station to these twin forts. One needs to then travel by road to the small village of Lohgad Wadi which lies just next to the forts. [4]
The two forts are unique in their formation and connected together by a ridge which is popularly known as ‘gaymukh’. There are four massive doors on the way to forts. They are named as Ganesh, Narayan, Hanuman and Mahadarwaja. There are some inscriptions that suggest that the Ganesh door was built during the rule of Nana Phadanavis. There is a 1500-meter-long wall that surrounds the fort and is easily visible from a long distance. The width of the wall is 30 meters. On the eastern side of the Lohagad Fort, there is a huge hole that is easily visible by the passing train from a very far distance.
Visapur Fort is located adjacent to Lohagad Fort and one needs to walk around a long wall to get to this unique fort. Visapur Fort was built after Lohagad Fort during 1713–1720 CE by Balaji Vishwanath, who was the first Peshwa of the Maratha Empire. There is a long wall that forms a fortification around Visapur Fort. The hill on which this fort is built is also famous for its historical caves of Bhaje that existed even before the fort was built. These caves are also important for the historians because of their Buddhist connection. There are a few stone houses located on this hill which is believed to the home of Peshwas. Apart from the stone houses and caves, once can also find some iron guns and cannons that give glimpses of the Maratha Rule.

Telugu: [ˈɦaɪ̯daɾaːbaːd] ⓘ ,
Urdu: [ˈɦɛːdəɾaːbaːd] ) is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana . It occupies 650 km2 (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River , in the northern part of Southern India. With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes , including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in the north of the city centre. According to the 2011 census of India , Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7 million residents in the metropolitan region , making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India. With an output of US$ 95 billion, [6] [7] Hyderabad has the sixth-largest urban economy in India.
The Qutb Shahi dynasty's Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond the fortified Golconda . In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals . In 1724, Asaf Jah I , the Mughal viceroy , declared his sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty , also known as the Nizams . Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahis from 1769 to 1948. As the capital of the princely state of Hyderabad , the city housed the British Residency and cantonment until Indian independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian Union in 1948 and continued as a capital of Hyderabad State from 1948 to 1956. After the introduction of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 , Hyderabad was made the capital of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh . In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was split to form the state of Telangana, and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states with a transitional arrangement scheduled to end in 2024. [8] Since 1956, the city has housed the Rashtrapati Nilayam , the winter office of the president of India .
Relics of the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras remain visible today; the Charminar has come to symbolise the city. By the end of the early modern era, the Mughal Empire had declined in the Deccan, and the Nizam's patronage attracted men of letters from various parts of the world. A distinctive culture arose from the amalgamation of local and migrated artisans, with painting , handicraft , jewellery , literature , dialect and clothing prominent even today. For its cuisine , the city is listed as a creative city of gastronomy by UNESCO . The Telugu film industry based in the city is the highest-grossing film industry in India as of 2021 [update] .
Until the 19th century, Hyderabad was known for the pearl industry and was nicknamed the ""City of Pearls"", and was the only trading centre for Golconda diamonds in the world. Many of the city's historical and traditional bazaars remain open. Hyderabad's central location between the Deccan Plateau and the Western Ghats , and industrialisation throughout the 20th century attracted major Indian research, manufacturing, educational and financial institutions. Since the 1990s, the city has emerged as an Indian hub of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and information technology. The formation of the special economic zones of Hardware Park and HITEC City , dedicated to information technology, has encouraged leading multinationals to set up operations in Hyderabad.
History

Toponymy
The name Hyderabad means ""Haydar's City"" or ""Lion City"", from haydar 'lion' and ābād 'city', after Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib , also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battle. [9] The city was originally called Baghnagar (""city of gardens""). [10] [11] The European travellers von Poser and Thévenot found both names in use in the 17th century. [12] [13] [14] : 6 A popular legend suggests that the founder of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah , named it Bhagya-nagar (""fortunate city"") [15] after Bhagmati , a local nautch (dancing girl) whom he married. She converted to Islam and adopted the title Hyder Mahal, the city being subsequently named Hyderabad in her honour. [14] : 6 [16]
In the year 1597, Hyderabad gained the epithet Farkhunda Bunyad ( lit. 'Of Auspicious Foundation'). Following the Mughal conquest of Hyderabad , emperor Aurangzeb changed the epithet to Dar-ul-Jihad ( lit. 'Abode of Holy War'), a title which appears on coins minted in the city during the reigns of Aurangzeb and Kam Bakhsh . The later Mughal emperor Shah Alam returned the city to its older epithet of Farkhunda Bunyad, and consequently Mughal coins of Shah Alam and Muhammad Shah feature this title as the city's mint-name. [17] [18]
Early and medieval history
Telangana since 2014
The discovery of Megalithic burial sites and cairn circles in the suburbs of Hyderabad, in 1851 by Philip Meadows Taylor , a polymath in the service of the Nizam, had provided evidence that the region in which the city stands has been inhabited since the Stone Age . [19] [20] In 2008, Archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed Iron Age sites that may date from 500 BCE . [21] The region comprising modern Hyderabad and its surroundings was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty from 624 CE to 1075 CE. [22] Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century, Golconda—now part of Hyderabad—came under the control of the Kakatiya dynasty from 1158, whose seat of power was at Warangal —148 km (92 mi) northeast of modern Hyderabad. [23] The Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva (1199–1262) built a hilltop outpost —later known as Golconda Fort —to defend their western region. [20]
The Kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the Khalji dynasty in 1310 after its defeat by Sultan Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate . This lasted until 1321 when the Kakatiya dynasty was annexed by Malik Kafur , Khalji's general. [24] During this period, Khalji took the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which is said to have been mined from the Kollur Mines of Golconda, to Delhi. [25] Muhammad bin Tughluq succeeded to the Delhi sultanate in 1325, bringing Warangal under the rule of the Tughlaq dynasty ; Malik Maqbul Tilangani was appointed its governor. In 1336 the regional chieftains Musunuri Nayakas —who revolted against the Delhi sultanate in 1333—took Warangal under their direct control and declared it as their capital. [26] In 1347 when Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah , a governor under bin Tughluq, rebelled against Delhi and established the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan Plateau , with Gulbarga —200 km (124 mi) west of Hyderabad—as its capital, both the neighbouring rulers Musunuri Nayakas of Warangal and Bahmani Sultans of Gulbarga engaged in many wars until 1364–65 when a peace treaty was signed and the Musunuri Nayakas ceded Golconda Fort to the Bahmani Sultan. The Bahmani Sultans ruled the region until 1518 and were the first independent Muslim rulers of the Deccan. [27] [28] [29]

In 1496 Sultan Quli was appointed as a Bahmani governor of Telangana. He rebuilt, expanded and fortified the old mud fort of Golconda and named the city ""Muhammad Nagar"". In 1518, he revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty . [23] [30] [31] The fifth Qutb Shahi sultan, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah , established Hyderabad on the banks of the Musi River in 1591, [32] [33] to avoid water shortages experienced at Golconda. [34] During his rule, he had the Charminar and Mecca Masjid built in the city. [35] On 21 September 1687, the Golconda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after a year-long siege of the Golconda Fort. [36] [37] The annexed city ""Hyderabad"" was renamed Darul Jihad (House of War), [38] whereas the main territories of the Golconda Sultanate were incorporated into the Mughal empire as the province Hyderabad Subah . [39] Mughal rule in Hyderabad was administered by three main governors: Jan Sipar Khan (1688–1700), his son Rustam Dil Khan (1700–13) and Mubariz Khan (1713–24). [40]
Modern history
In 1713, Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar appointed Mubariz Khan as Governor of Hyderabad. During his tenure, he fortified the city and controlled the internal and neighbouring threats. [41] In 1714 Farrukhsiyar appointed Asaf Jah I as Viceroy of the Deccan —(administrator of six Mughal governorates) with the title Nizam-ul-Mulk (Administrator of the Realm). In 1721, he was appointed as Prime Minister of the Mughal Empire . [42] His differences with the court nobles led him to resign from all the imperial responsibilities in 1723 and leave for Deccan. [43] [44] Under the influence of Asaf Jah I's opponents, Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah issued a decree to Mubariz Khan , to stop Asaf Jah I which resulted in the Battle of Shakar Kheda . [43] : 93–94 In 1724, Asaf Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the Deccan , named the region Hyderabad Deccan , and started what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty . Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asaf Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad . [41] [45] The death of Asaf Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons and grandson— Nasir Jung (1748–1750), Muzaffar Jang (1750–1751) and Salabat Jung (1751–1762)—contended for the throne backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. The accession of Asaf Jah II , who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768 he signed the Treaty of Masulipatam —by which the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent, got the right to control and collect the taxes at Coromandel Coast . [46]

In 1769 Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Asaf Jahi Nizams. [41] [45] In response to regular threats from Hyder Ali (Dalwai of Mysore ), Baji Rao I ( Peshwa of the Maratha Empire ), and Basalath Jung (Asaf Jah II's elder brother, who was supported by French General the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau ), the Nizam signed a subsidiary alliance with the East India Company in 1798, allowing the British Indian Army to be stationed at Bolarum (modern Secunderabad ) to protect the state's capital, for which the Nizams paid an annual maintenance to the British. [46]
Until 1874 there were no modern industries in Hyderabad. With the introduction of railways in the 1880s, four factories were built to the south and east of Hussain Sagar lake, [47] and during the early 20th century, Hyderabad was transformed into a modern city with the establishment of transport services , underground drainage, running water, electricity , telecommunications, universities, industries, and Begumpet Airport . The Nizams ruled the princely state of Hyderabad during the British Raj . [41] [45]
Post-Independence
A mill with a canal connecting to Hussain Sagar lake. Following the introduction of railways in the 1880s, factories were built around the lake.
After India gained independence , the Nizam declared his intention to remain independent rather than become part of the Indian Union or newly formed Dominion of Pakistan . [46] The Hyderabad State Congress, with the support of the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India , began agitating against Nizam VII in 1948. On 17 September that year, the Indian Army took control of Hyderabad State after an invasion codenamed Operation Polo . With the defeat of his forces, Nizam VII capitulated to the Indian Union by signing an Instrument of Accession , which made him the Rajpramukh (Princely Governor) of the state until it was abolished on 31 October 1956. [45] [48]
Between 1946 and 1951, the Communist Party of India fomented the Telangana uprising against the feudal lords of the Telangana region . [49] The Constitution of India , which became effective on 26 January 1950, made Hyderabad State one of the part B states of India, with Hyderabad city continuing to be the capital. [50] In his 1955 report Thoughts on Linguistic States, B. R. Ambedkar , then chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution , proposed designating the city of Hyderabad as the second capital of India because of its amenities and strategic central location. [51]
On 1 November 1956 the states of India were reorganised by language. Hyderabad state was split into three parts, which were merged with neighbouring states to form Maharashtra , Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh . The nine Telugu - and Urdu -speaking districts of Hyderabad State in the Telangana region were merged with the Telugu-speaking Andhra State to create Andhra Pradesh, [52] [53] [54] with Hyderabad as its capital. Several protests, known collectively as the Telangana movement , attempted to invalidate the merger and demanded the creation of a new Telangana state. Major actions took place in 1969 and 1972, and a third began in 2010. [55] On 30 July 2013 the government of India declared that part of Andhra Pradesh would be split off to form a new Telangana state and that Hyderabad city would be the capital city and part of Telangana, while the city would also remain the capital of Andhra Pradesh for no more than ten years. On 3 October 2013 the Union Cabinet approved the proposal, [56] and in February 2014 both houses of Parliament passed the Telangana Bill . With the final assent of the President of India, Telangana state was formed on 2 June 2014.

In Hyderabad police jurisdiction is divided into three commissionerates: Hyderabad (established in 1847 AD, the oldest police commissionerate in India ), Cyberabad , and Rachakonda , each headed by a commissioner of police , who are Indian Police Service (IPS) officers. The Hyderabad police is a division of the Telangana Police , under the state Home Ministry. [90] [91]
The jurisdictions of the city's administrative agencies are, in ascending order of size: the Hyderabad Police area, Hyderabad district, the GHMC area (""Hyderabad city""), and the area under the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA). The HMDA is an apolitical urban planning agency that covers the GHMC and its suburbs, extending to 54 mandals in five districts encircling the city. It coordinates the development activities of GHMC and suburban municipalities and manages the administration of bodies such as the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB). [92]
Hyderabad is the seat of the Government of Telangana , Government of Andhra Pradesh and the President of India's winter retreat Rashtrapati Nilayam , as well as the Telangana High Court and various local government agencies. The Lower City Civil Court and the Metropolitan Criminal Court are under the jurisdiction of the High Court. [93] [94] [95] : 1 The GHMC area contains 24 State Legislative Assembly constituencies, [96] [97] which form five constituencies of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Parliament of India). [98]

The HMWSSB (Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewage Board) regulates rainwater harvesting , sewerage services, and water supply. In 2005, the HMWSSB started operating a 116 km-long (72 mi) water supply pipeline from Nagarjuna Sagar Dam to meet increasing demand. [99] [100] The Telangana Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSPDCL) manages electricity supply. [101] As of 2014 [update] , there were 15 fire stations in the city, operated by the Telangana State Disaster and Fire Response Department. [102] The government-owned India Post has five head post offices and many sub-post offices in Hyderabad, which are complemented by private courier services. [62]
Pollution control
Hyderabad produces around 4,500 tonnes of solid waste daily, which is transported from collection units in Imlibun , Yousufguda and Lower Tank Bund to the dumpsite in Jawaharnagar . [103] Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. [104] Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has led to increased industrial waste , air , noise and water pollution , which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). [105] [106] The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% from a combination of vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. [107] Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. [108] [109] [110] The city's ""VIP areas"", the Assembly building, Secretariat, and Telangana chief minister's office, have particularly low air quality index ratings, suffering from high levels of PM2.5 's. [111] Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, [112] is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels. [113] [114] This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated affluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city. [115]

The Commissionerate of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for planning, implementation and monitoring of all facilities related to health and preventive services. [116] [117] As of 2010 [update] –11, the city had 50 government hospitals, [118] 300 private and charity hospitals and 194 nursing homes providing around 12,000 hospital beds, fewer than half the required 25,000. [119] For every 10,000 people in the city, there are 17.6 hospital beds, [120] 9 specialist doctors, 14 nurses and 6 physicians. [119] The city has about 4,000 individual clinics. [121] Private clinics are preferred by many residents because of the distance to, poor quality of care at and long waiting times in government facilities, [122] : 60–61 despite the high proportion of the city's residents being covered by government health insurance: 24% according to a National Family Health Survey in 2005. [122] : 41 As of 2012 [update] , many new private hospitals of various sizes were opened or being built. [121] Hyderabad has outpatient and inpatient facilities that use Unani , homoeopathic and Ayurvedic treatments. [123]
In the 2005 National Family Health Survey, it was reported that the city's total fertility rate is 1.8, [122] : 47 which is below the replacement rate . Only 61% of children had been provided with all basic vaccines ( BCG , measles and full courses of polio and DPT ), fewer than in all other surveyed cities except Meerut . [122] : 98 The infant mortality rate was 35 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate for children under five was 41 per 1,000 live births. [122] : 97 The survey also reported that a third of women and a quarter of men are overweight or obese, 49% of children below 5 years are anaemic , and up to 20% of children are underweight, [122] : 44, 55–56 while more than 2% of women and 3% of men suffer from diabetes .

As of 2012, in the greater metropolitan area, 13% of the population live below the poverty line . [145] According to a 2012 report submitted by GHMC to the World Bank , Hyderabad has 1,476 slums with a total population of 1.7 million, of whom 66% live in 985 slums in the ""core"" of the city (the part that formed Hyderabad before the April 2007 expansion) and the remaining 34% live in 491 suburban tenements. [146] About 22% of the slum-dwelling households had migrated from different parts of India in the last decade of the 20th century, and 63% claimed to have lived in the slums for more than 10 years. [87] : 55 Overall literacy in the slums is 60–80% and female literacy is 52–73%. A third of the slums have basic service connections, and the remainder depend on general public services provided by the government. There are 405 government schools, 267 government-aided schools, 175 private schools, and 528 community halls in the slum areas. [147] : 70 According to a 2008 survey by the Centre for Good Governance, 87.6% of the slum-dwelling households are nuclear families , 18% are very poor, with an income up to ₹20,000 (US$230) per annum, 73% live below the poverty line (a standard poverty line recognised by the Andhra Pradesh Government is ₹24,000 (US$280) per annum), 27% of the chief wage earners (CWE) are casual labour and 38% of the CWE are illiterate.

The historic city established by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah on the southern side of the Musi River forms the heritage region of Hyderabad called the Purana Shahar (Old City), while the ""New City"" encompasses the urbanised area on the northern banks. The two are connected by many bridges across the river, the oldest of which is Purana Pul —(""old bridge"") built in 1578 AD. [148] Hyderabad is twinned with neighbouring Secunderabad , to which it is connected by Hussain Sagar . [149]
North of central Hyderabad lies Hussain Sagar, Tank Bund Road , Rani Gunj and the Secunderabad railway station . [149] Most of the city's parks and recreational centres, such as Sanjeevaiah Park , Indira Park , Lumbini Park , NTR Gardens , the Buddha statue and Tankbund Park are located here. [152] In the northwest part of the city there are upscale residential and commercial areas such as Banjara Hills , Jubilee Hills , Begumpet , Khairtabad , Tolichowki , Jagannath Temple and Miyapur . [153] The northern end contains industrial areas such as Kukatpally , Sanathnagar , Moosapet , Balanagar , Patancheru and Chanda Nagar . The northeast end is dotted with residential areas such as Malkajgiri , Neredmet , A. S. Rao Nagar and Uppal . [149] [150] [151] In the eastern part of the city lie many defence research centres and Ramoji Film City . The ""Cyberabad"" area in the southwest and west of the city, consisting of Madhapur and Gachibowli has grown rapidly since the 1990s. It is home to information technology and bio-pharmaceutical companies and to landmarks such as Hyderabad Airport, Osman Sagar , Himayath Sagar and Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park . [154] [155]
Landmarks
Heritage buildings constructed during the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras showcase Indo-Islamic architecture influenced by Medieval , Mughal and European styles. [10] [156] After the 1908 flooding of the Musi River , the city was expanded and civic monuments constructed, particularly during the rule of Mir Osman Ali Khan (the VIIth Nizam), whose patronage of architecture led to him being referred to as the maker of modern Hyderabad. [157] [158] In 2012, the government of India declared Hyderabad the first ""Best heritage city of India"". [159]
Qutb Shahi architecture of the 16th and early 17th centuries followed classical Persian architecture featuring domes and colossal arches. [160] The oldest surviving Qutb Shahi structure in Hyderabad is the ruins of the Golconda Fort built in the 16th century. Most of the historical bazaars that still exist were constructed on the street north of Charminar towards the fort. The Charminar has become an icon of the city; located in the centre of old Hyderabad, it is a square structure with sides 20 m (66 ft) long and four grand arches each facing a road. At each corner stands a 56 m (184 ft)-high minaret. The Charminar, Golconda Fort and the Qutb Shahi tombs are considered to be monuments of national importance in India ; in 2010 the Indian government proposed that the sites be listed for UNESCO World Heritage status . [157] [161] [162] : 11–18 [163]
Among the oldest surviving examples of Nizam architecture in Hyderabad is the Chowmahalla Palace , which was the seat of royal power . It showcases a diverse array of architectural styles, from the Baroque Harem to its Neoclassical royal court. The other palaces include Falaknuma Palace (inspired by the style of Andrea Palladio ), Purani Haveli , King Kothi Palace and Bella Vista Palace all of which were built at the peak of Nizam rule in the 19th century. During Mir Osman Ali Khan's rule, European styles, along with Indo-Islamic, became prominent. These styles are reflected in the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture seen in many civic monuments such as the Hyderabad High Court , Osmania Hospital , City College and the Kacheguda railway station , all designed by Vincent Esch . [164] Other landmark structures of the city constructed during his regin are the State Central Library , the Telangana Legislature, the State Archaeology Museum , Jubilee Hall , and Hyderabad railway station . [157] [160] [165] [166] Other landmarks of note are Paigah Palace , Asman Garh Palace , Basheer Bagh Palace , Errum Manzil and the Spanish Mosque , all constructed by the Paigah family . [162] : 16–17 [167] [168]

Recent estimates of the economy of Hyderabad's metropolitan area have ranged from US$40-US$74 billion ( PPP GDP ), and have ranked it either fifth- or sixth- most productive metro area of India . [169] Hyderabad is the largest contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP), tax and other revenues, of Telangana, and the sixth largest deposit centre and fourth largest credit centre nationwide, as ranked by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in June 2012. [170] Its per capita annual income in 2011 was ₹44,300 (US$510). [171] As of 2006 [update] , the largest employers in the city were the state government (113,098 employees) and central government (85,155). [172] According to a 2005 survey, 77% of males and 19% of females in the city were employed. [173] The service industry remains dominant in the city, and 90% of the employed workforce is engaged in this sector. [174]
Hyderabad's role in the pearl trade has given it the name "" City of Pearls "" and up until the 18th century, the city was the only global trading centre for diamonds known as Golconda diamonds . [37] [175] [176] Industrialisation began under the Nizams in the late 19th century, helped by railway expansion that connected the city with major ports. [177] [178] From the 1950s to the 1970s, Indian enterprises, such as Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), Bharat Electronics (BEL), Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) and Andhra Bank (AB) [150] were established in the city. [179] The city is home to Hyderabad Securities formerly known as Hyderabad Stock Exchange (HSE), [180] and houses the regional office of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). [181] In 2013, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) facility in Hyderabad was forecast to provide operations and transactions services to BSE- Mumbai by the end of 2014. [182] The growth of the financial services sector has helped Hyderabad evolve from a traditional manufacturing city to a cosmopolitan industrial service centre. [150] Since the 1990s, the growth of information technology (IT), IT-enabled services (ITES), insurance and financial institutions has expanded the service sector, and these primary economic activities have boosted the ancillary sectors of trade and commerce, transport, storage, communication, real estate and retail. [178] As of 2021 [update] , the IT exports from Hyderabad were ₹ 1,45,522 crore (US$19.66 billion), the city houses 1500 IT and TES companies that provide 628,615 jobs. [183]
Hyderabad's commercial markets are divided into four sectors: central business districts, [184] sub-central business centres, neighbourhood business centres and local business centres. [185] Many traditional and historic bazaars are located throughout the city, Laad Bazaar being the prominent among all is popular for selling a variety of traditional and cultural antique wares, along with gems and pearls. [186] [187]

The establishment of Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL), a public sector undertaking, in 1961 was followed over the decades by many national and global companies opening manufacturing and research facilities in the city. [188] As of 2010 [update] , the city manufactured one third of India's bulk drugs and 16% of biotechnology products, [189] [190] contributing to its reputation as ""India's pharmaceutical capital"" and the "" Genome Valley of India"". [191] Hyderabad is a global centre of information technology, for which it is known as Cyberabad (Cyber City). [154] [155] As of 2013 [update] , it contributed 15% of India's and 98% of Andhra Pradesh's exports in IT and ITES sectors [192] and 22% of NASSCOM 's total membership is from the city. [171] The development of HITEC City , a township with extensive technological infrastructure, prompted multinational companies to establish facilities in Hyderabad. [154] The city is home to more than 1300 IT and ITES firms that provide employment for 407,000 individuals; the global conglomerates include Microsoft , Apple , Amazon , Google , IBM , Yahoo! , Oracle Corporation , Dell , Facebook , CISCO , [87] : 3 [193] and major Indian firms including Tech Mahindra , Infosys , Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Polaris, Cyient and Wipro . [87] : 3 In 2009 the World Bank Group ranked the city as the second best Indian city for doing business . [194] The city and its suburbs contain the highest number of special economic zones of any Indian city. [171]
The Automotive industry in Hyderabad is also emerging and making it an automobile hub. [195] Automobile companies including as Hyundai , Hyderabad Allwyn , Praga Tools , HMT Bearings , Ordnance Factory Medak , Deccan Auto and Mahindra & Mahindra have units in the Hyderabad economic zone. [196] Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , Maruti Suzuki and Triton Energy will invest in Hyderabad. [197]
Like the rest of India, Hyderabad has a large informal economy that employs 30% of the labour force. [147] : 71 According to a survey published in 2007, it had 40–50,000 street vendors , and their numbers were increasing. [198] : 9 Among the street vendors, 84% are male and 16% female, [199] : 12 and four fifths are ""stationary vendors"" operating from a fixed pitch, often with their own stall . [199] : 15–16 Most are financed through personal savings; only 8% borrow from moneylenders. [199] : 19 Vendor earnings vary from ₹50 (58¢ US) to ₹800 (US$9.20) per day. [198] : 25 Other unorganised economic sectors include dairy, poultry farming, brick manufacturing, casual labour and domestic help. Those involved in the informal economy constitute a major portion of the urban poor. [147] : 71 [200]
In 2024, the World Economic Forum established a Centre for Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR), in the city. Which it describes as a hub to leverage the latest technology in advancing the life sciences and health sectors. [201]
Culture
Makkah Masjid constructed during the Qutb Shahi and Mughal rule in Hyderabad
Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire . After the fall of Delhi in 1857 , the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the Indian subcontinent , under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu. [202] [203] This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages, cultures and religions, which has since led to a co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions , for which the city has become noted. [204] [205] : viii A further consequence of this north–south mix is that both Telugu and Urdu are official languages of Telangana. [206] The mixing of religions has resulted in many festivals being celebrated in Hyderabad such as Ganesh Chaturthi , Diwali and Bonalu of Hindu tradition and Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha by Muslims. [207]
Traditional Hyderabadi garb reveals a mix of Muslim and Hindu influences with men wearing sherwani and kurta – paijama and women wearing khara dupatta and salwar kameez . [208] [209] [210] Most Muslim women wear burqa and hijab outdoors. [211] In addition to the traditional Hindu and Muslim garments, increasing exposure to western cultures has led to a rise in the wearing of western style clothing among youths. [212]
Literature
In the past, Qutb Shahi rulers and Asaf Jahi Nizams attracted artists, architects, and men of letters from different parts of the world through patronage. The resulting ethnic mix popularised cultural events such as mushairas (poetic symposia), Qawwali (devotional songs) and Dholak ke Geet (traditional folk songs). [213] [214] [215] The Qutb Shahi dynasty particularly encouraged the growth of Deccani literature leading to works such as the Deccani Masnavi and Diwan poetry , which are among the earliest available manuscripts in Urdu. [216] Lazzat Un Nisa , a book compiled in the 15th century at Qutb Shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret medicines and stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual arts. [217] The reign of the Asaf Jahi Nizams saw many literary reforms and the introduction of Urdu as a language of court, administration and education. [218] In 1824, a collection of Urdu Ghazal poetry, named Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa, authored by Mah Laqa Bai —the first female Urdu poet to produce a Diwan—was published in Hyderabad. [219] Hyderabad has continued with these traditions in its annual Hyderabad Literary Festival , held since 2010, showcasing the city's literary and cultural creativity. [220] Organisations engaged in the advancement of literature include the Sahitya Akademi , the Urdu Academy, the Telugu Academy, the National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language , the Comparative Literature Association of India, and the Andhra Saraswata Parishad. Literary development is further aided by state institutions such as the State Central Library, the largest public library in the state which was established in 1891, [221] and other major libraries including the Sri Krishna Devaraya Andhra Bhasha Nilayam , the British Library and the Sundarayya Vignana Kendram . [222]

Music and films
Ravindra Bharathi , an auditorium named after Rabindranath Tagore
South Indian music and dances such as the Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam styles are popular in the Deccan region. As a result of their cultural policies, North Indian music and dance gained popularity during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams, [223] and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif (courtesans). These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture and were appointed to teach singing, poetry, and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy. [224] This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based marfa music , Dholak ke Geet (household songs based on local folklore ), and qawwali , especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events. [225] [226] The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music. [227]
Although the city is not particularly noted for theatre and drama, [228] the state government promotes theatre with multiple programmes and festivals [229] [230] in such venues as the Ravindra Bharathi , Shilpakala Vedika , Lalithakala Thoranam and Lamakaan . Although not a purely music-oriented event, Numaish , a popular annual exhibition of local and national consumer products, does feature some musical performances. [231]
The city is home to the Telugu film industry, popularly known as Tollywood —as of 2021 [update] it is the highest-grossing Indian film industry . [232] In the 1970s, Deccani language realist films by globally acclaimed Shyam Benegal started a movement of coming of age art films in India, which came to be known as parallel cinema . [233] The Deccani film industry (""Dollywood"") produces films in the local Hyderabadi dialect, which have gained regional popularity since 2005. [234] The city has hosted international film festivals such as the International Children's Film Festival and the Hyderabad International Film Festival . [235] In 2005, Guinness World Records declared Ramoji Film City to be the world's largest film studio. [236]
Art and handicrafts

The region is well known for its Golconda and Hyderabad painting styles which are branches of Deccan painting . [237] Developed during the 16th century, the Golconda style is a native style blending foreign techniques and bears some similarity to the Vijayanagara paintings of neighbouring Mysore. A significant use of luminous gold and white colours is generally found in the Golconda style. [238] The Hyderabad style originated in the 17th century under the Nizams. Highly influenced by Mughal painting , this style makes use of bright colours and mostly depicts regional landscape, culture, costumes, and jewellery. [237]
Although not a centre for handicrafts itself, the patronage of the arts by the Mughals and Nizams attracted artisans from the region to Hyderabad. Such crafts include: Wootz steel , Filigree work , Bidriware , a metalwork handicraft from neighbouring Karnataka , which was popularised during the 18th century and has since been granted a Geographical Indication (GI) tag under the auspices of the WTO act; [157] [239] and Zari and Zardozi , embroidery works on textile that involve making elaborate designs using gold, silver and other metal threads. [240] Chintz —a glazed calico textiles was originated in Golconda in 16th century. [241] [242] and another example of a handicraft drawn to Hyderabad is Kalamkari , a hand-painted or block-printed cotton textile that comes from cities in Andhra Pradesh. This craft is distinguished in having both a Hindu style, known as Srikalahasti and entirely done by hand, and an Islamic style, known as Machilipatnam which uses both hand and block techniques. [243] Examples of Hyderabad's arts and crafts are housed in various museums including the Salar Jung Museum (housing ""one of the largest one-man-collections in the world"" [244] ), the Telangana State Archaeology Museum , the Nizam Museum , the City Museum and the Birla Science Museum .

(Redirected from List of rivers in India )
Map of India showing the major rivers.
With a land area of 3,287,263 km2 (1,269,219 sq mi) consisting of diverse ecosystems, India has many rivers systems and perennial streams. [1] The rivers of India can be classified into four groups – Himalayan, Deccan, Coastal, and Inland drainage. The Himalayan rivers, mainly fed by glaciers and snow melt, arise from the Himalayas . The Deccan rivers system consists of rivers in Peninsular India , that drain into the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea . There are numerous short coastal rivers, predominantly on the West coast . There are few inland rivers, which do not drain into sea. [2] [3]
Most of the rivers in India originate from the four major watersheds in India. The Himalayan watershed is the source of majority of the major river systems in India including the three longest rivers–the Ganges , the Brahmaputra and the Indus . [3] [4] These three river systems are fed by more than 5000 glaciers. [5] The Aravalli range in the north-west serves the origin of few of the rivers such as the Chambal , the Banas and the Luni rivers. [4]
The Narmada and Tapti rivers originate from the Vindhya and Satpura ranges in Central India . [4] In the peninsular India, majority of the rivers originate from the Western Ghats and flow towards the Bay of Bengal, while only a few rivers flow from east to west from the Eastern Ghats to the Arabian sea. This is because of the difference in elevation of the Deccan plateau, which slopes gently from the west to the east. [6] The largest of the peninsular rivers include the Godavari , the Krishna , the Mahanadi and the Kaveri . [3] [4]
River systems
[ edit ]
Chart showing the major river systems of India along with the tributaries and distributaries of some of them.
As per the classification of Food and Agriculture Organization , the rivers systems are combined into 20 river units, which includes 14 major rivers systems and 99 smaller river basins grouped into six river units. The Ganges - Brahmaputra - Meghna basin is the largest, which covers 34% of the land area and contributes to nearly 59% of the available water resources. [2]

The Buddhist Mahastupa or the great stupa and vihara in Dhulikatta village were established at the end of the 2nd century BC, which is more than 2000 years ago. During that period, the region played a greater role and thus was protected with numerous fortifications. According to many historians, the description of this fortified town which is situated on the banks of a river that has been conceptualized by the Greek emissary Megasthenes , matches with that of this town. The remains and ruins of this ancient stupa that has been built on an elevated place are still discernible. The constructions of platforms make the Mahastupa look larger. The lime-stone blocks that are elegantly carved are decorated with many Buddhist symbols like the Muchalinda Naga (a snake from the Buddhist mythology).

[3] Work on Delhi's second Dilli Haat, in Pitampura , close to Pitampura TV Tower and spread over 3 hectares, began in 2008. [4]
Exhibition and Conference
Musical Fountain - located at Ajmal Khan Park with water cascades synchronised to coloured lights, each show lasts 20 minutes.
Sound and Light show (Son-et-lumiere) - takes place at the Old Fort, Delhi and projects the Fort's history realistically through weekly one-hour shows in Hindi and English covering the history of Delhi over a period of 5000 years. Other activities include boating at nearby lakes and arranging for para-sailing and mountaineering activities in India.
South Extension is an up market shopping area and several global brands are available here.
Chandni Chowk is India’s largest wholesale market and tiny kiosks have brisk sales. It is located in Old Delhi. According to the history of Delhi Shah Jehan had planned the market for his daughter to shop at her will for whatever she wanted.
Dilli Haat is an addition to the magnificence of Delhi where artisans from various corners of India showcase their talent and sell their wares.
Besides the core activity of promotion of tourism, the Corporation directly sells liquor all over Delhi, which is one of the few activities that provides net profit to the corporation. The sale of liquor is carried out through liquor shops, which number over one hundred, and includes the direct selling of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and Country Made Liquor (CL).
The Corporation constructs flyovers as part of the development of infrastructure for easy commuting by tourists in Delhi. The revenue for the construction of some of the flyovers in Delhi has been generated from a share of profit that the Corporation earns from the sale of Country made Liquor (CL). The Corporation charges a flat rate of profit, a margin of Rs.6 per bottle of country liquor, of which a share of Rs.5/- has been fixed as a contribution towards the construction of flyovers. The construction is carried of tourism by transferring knowledge in areas of tour and tourism.

Islam - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam,"Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem built by caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ; completed at the end of the Second Fitna
Muhammad died in 632 and the first successors, called Caliphs – Abu Bakr , Umar , Uthman ibn al-Affan , Ali ibn Abi Talib and sometimes Hasan ibn Ali [132] – are known in Sunni Islam as al-khulafā' ar-rāshidūn ("" Rightly Guided Caliphs ""). [133] Some tribes left Islam and rebelled under leaders who declared themselves new prophets but were crushed by Abu Bakr in the Ridda wars . [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] Local populations of Jews and indigenous Christians, persecuted as religious minorities and heretics and taxed heavily, often helped Muslims take over their lands, [139] resulting in rapid expansion of the caliphate into the Persian and Byzantine empires. [140] [141] [142] [143] Uthman was elected in 644 and his assassination by rebels led to Ali being elected the next Caliph. In the First Civil War , Muhammad's widow, Aisha , raised an army against Ali, attempting to avenge the death of Uthman, but was defeated at the Battle of the Camel . Ali attempted to remove the governor of Syria, Mu'awiya , who was seen as corrupt. Mu'awiya then declared war on Ali and was defeated in the Battle of Siffin . Ali's decision to arbitrate angered the Kharijites , an extremist sect, who felt that by not fighting a sinner, Ali became a sinner as well. The Kharijites rebelled and were defeated in the Battle of Nahrawan but a Kharijite assassin later killed Ali. Ali's son, Hasan ibn Ali, was elected Caliph and signed a peace treaty to avoid further fighting, abdicating to Mu'awiya in return for Mu'awiya not appointing a successor. [144] Mu'awiya began the Umayyad dynasty with the appointment of his son Yazid I as successor, sparking the Second Civil War . During the Battle of Karbala , Husayn ibn Ali was killed by Yazid's forces; the event has been annually commemorated by Shias ever since. Sunnis, led by Ibn al-Zubayr and opposed to a dynastic caliphate, were defeated in the siege of Mecca . These disputes over leadership would give rise to the Sunni - Shia schism, [145] with the Shia believing leadership belongs to Muhammad's family through Ali, called the ahl al-bayt . [146] Abu Bakr's leadership oversaw the beginning of the compilation of the Quran. The Caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz set up the committee, The Seven Fuqaha of Medina , [147] [148] and Malik ibn Anas wrote one of the earliest books on Islamic jurisprudence, the Muwatta , as a consensus of the opinion of those jurists. [149] [150] [151] The Kharijites believed there was no compromised middle ground between good and evil, and any Muslim who committed a grave sin would become an unbeliever. The term ""kharijites"" would also be used to refer to later groups such as ISIS . [152] The Murji'ah taught that people's righteousness could be judged by God alone. Therefore, wrongdoers might be considered misguided, but not denounced as unbelievers. [153] This attitude came to prevail into mainstream Islamic beliefs. [154]
The Umayyad dynasty conquered the Maghreb , the Iberian Peninsula , Narbonnese Gaul and Sindh . [155] The Umayyads struggled with a lack of legitimacy and relied on a heavily patronized military. [156] Since the jizya tax was a tax paid by non-Muslims which exempted them from military service, the Umayyads denied recognizing the conversion of non-Arabs, as it reduced revenue. [154] While the Rashidun Caliphate emphasized austerity, with Umar even requiring an inventory of each official's possessions, [157] Umayyad luxury bred dissatisfaction among the pious. [154] The Kharijites led the Berber Revolt , leading to the first Muslim states independent of the Caliphate. In the Abbasid Revolution , non-Arab converts ( mawali ), Arab clans pushed aside by the Umayyad clan, and some Shi'a rallied and overthrew the Umayyads, inaugurating the more cosmopolitan Abbasid dynasty in 750. [158] [159]
Classical era (750–1258)

Al-Shafi'i codified a method to determine the reliability of hadith. [160] During the early Abbasid era, scholars such as Muhammad al-Bukhari and Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj compiled the major Sunni hadith collections while scholars like Al-Kulayni and Ibn Babawayh compiled major Shia hadith collections. The four Sunni Madh'habs , the Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, and Shafi'i, were established around the teachings of Abū Ḥanīfa , Ahmad ibn Hanbal , Malik ibn Anas and al-Shafi'i . In contrast, the teachings of Ja'far al-Sadiq formed the Ja'fari jurisprudence . In the 9th century, Al-Tabari completed the first commentary of the Quran, the Tafsir al-Tabari , which became one of the most cited commentaries in Sunni Islam. Some Muslims began questioning the piety of indulgence in worldly life and emphasized poverty, humility, and avoidance of sin based on renunciation of bodily desires. Ascetics such as Hasan al-Basri inspired a movement that would evolve into tasawwuf or Sufism . [161] [162]
At this time, theological problems, notably on free will, were prominently tackled, with Hasan al Basri holding that although God knows people's actions, good and evil come from abuse of free will and the devil . [163] [b] Greek rationalist philosophy influenced a speculative school of thought known as Muʿtazila , who famously advocated the notion of free-will originated by Wasil ibn Ata . [165] Caliph Mamun al Rashid made it an official creed and unsuccessfully attempted to force this position on the majority. [166] Caliph Al-Mu'tasim carried out inquisitions , with the traditionalist Ahmad ibn Hanbal notably refusing to conform to the Muʿtazila idea that the Quran was created rather than being eternal , which resulted in him being tortured and kept in an unlit prison cell for nearly thirty months. [167] However, other schools of speculative theology – Māturīdism founded by Abu Mansur al-Maturidi and Ash'ari founded by Al-Ash'ari – were more successful in being widely adopted. Philosophers such as Al-Farabi , Avicenna and Averroes sought to harmonize Aristotle's ideas with the teachings of Islam, similar to later scholasticism within Christianity in Europe and Maimonides ' work within Judaism, while others like Al-Ghazali argued against such syncretism and ultimately prevailed. [168] [169]
The eye, according to Hunain ibn Ishaq from a manuscript dated c. 1200
This era is sometimes called the "" Islamic Golden Age "". [170] [171] [172] [173] [141] Islamic scientific achievements spanned a wide range of subject areas including medicine , mathematics , astronomy , and agriculture as well as physics , economics , engineering and optics . [174] [175] [176] [177] Avicenna was a pioneer in experimental medicine , [178] [179] and his The Canon of Medicine was used as a standard medicinal text in the Islamic world and Europe for centuries. Rhazes was the first to identify the diseases smallpox and measles . [180] Public hospitals of the time issued the first medical diplomas to license doctors. [181] [182] Ibn al-Haytham is regarded as the father of the modern scientific method and often referred to as the ""world's first true scientist"", in particular regarding his work in optics . [183] [184] [185] In engineering, the Banū Mūsā brothers' automatic flute player is considered to have been the first programmable machine . [186] In mathematics , the concept of the algorithm is named after Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi , who is considered a founder of algebra , which is named after his book al-jabr , while others developed the concept of a function . [187] The government paid scientists the equivalent salary of professional athletes today. [188] Guinness World Records recognizes the University of Al Karaouine , founded in 859, as the world's oldest degree-granting university. [189] Many non-Muslims, such as Christians , Jews and Sabians , [190] contributed to the Islamic civilization in various fields, [191] [192] and the institution known as the House of Wisdom employed Christian and Persian scholars to both translate works into Arabic and to develop new knowledge. [193] [190] [194]
Soldiers broke away from the Abbasid empire and established their own dynasties, such as the Tulunids in 868 in Egypt [195] and the Ghaznavid dynasty in 977 in Central Asia. [196] In this fragmentation came the Shi'a Century , roughly between 945 and 1055, which saw the rise of the millennialist Isma'ili Shi'a missionary movement. One Isma'ili group, the Fatimid dynasty , took control of North Africa in the 10th century [197] and another Isma'ili group, the Qarmatians , sacked Mecca and stole the Black Stone , a rock placed within the Kaaba, in their unsuccessful rebellion. [198] Yet another Isma'ili group, the Buyid dynasty , conquered Baghdad and turned the Abbasids into a figurehead monarchy. The Sunni Seljuk dynasty campaigned to reassert Sunni Islam by promulgating the scholarly opinions of the time, notably with the construction of educational institutions known as Nezamiyeh , which are associated with Al-Ghazali and Saadi Shirazi . [199]
The expansion of the Muslim world continued with religious missions converting Volga Bulgaria to Islam. The Delhi Sultanate reached deep into the Indian Subcontinent and many converted to Islam, [200] in particular low-caste Hindus whose descendants make up the vast majority of Indian Muslims. [201] Trade brought many Muslims to China , where they virtually dominated the import and export industry of the Song dynasty . [202] Muslims were recruited as a governing minority class in the Yuan dynasty . [203]
Pre-modern era (1258 – 18th century)
Ghazan Khan , 7th Ilkhanate ruler of the Mongol Empire , converts to Islam. 14th-century depiction
Through Muslim trade networks and the activity of Sufi orders, [204] Islam spread into new areas [205] and Muslims assimilated into new cultures.
Under the Ottoman Empire , Islam spread to Southeast Europe . [206] Conversion to Islam often involved a degree of syncretism , [207] as illustrated by Muhammad's appearance in Hindu folklore. [208] Muslim Turks incorporated elements of Turkish Shamanism beliefs to Islam. [c] [210] Muslims in Ming Dynasty China who were descended from earlier immigrants were assimilated, sometimes through laws mandating assimilation, [211] by adopting Chinese names and culture while Nanjing became an important centre of Islamic study. [212] [213]
Cultural shifts were evident with the decrease in Arab influence after the Mongol destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate. [214] The Muslim Mongol Khanates in Iran and Central Asia benefited from increased cross-cultural access to East Asia under Mongol rule and thus flourished and developed more distinctively from Arab influence, such as the Timurid Renaissance under the Timurid dynasty . [215] Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) proposed the mathematical model that was later argued to be adopted by Copernicus unrevised in his heliocentric model, [216] and Jamshīd al-Kāshī 's estimate of pi would not be surpassed for 180 years. [217]
After the introduction of gunpowder weapons, large and centralized Muslim states consolidated around gunpowder empires , these had been previously splintered amongst various territories. The caliphate was claimed by the Ottoman dynasty of the Ottoman Empire and its claims were strengthened in 1517 as Selim I became the ruler of Mecca and Medina . [218] The Shia Safavid dynasty rose to power in 1501 and later conquered all of Iran. [219] In South Asia, Babur founded the Mughal Empire . [220]
The religion of the centralized states of the gunpowder empires influenced the religious practice of their constituent populations. A symbiosis between Ottoman rulers and Sufism strongly influenced Islamic reign by the Ottomans from the beginning. The Mevlevi Order and Bektashi Order had a close relation to the sultans, [221] as Sufi-mystical as well as heterodox and syncretic approaches to Islam flourished. [222] The often forceful Safavid conversion of Iran to the Twelver Shia Islam of the Safavid Empire ensured the final dominance of the Twelver sect within Shia Islam. Persian migrants to South Asia, as influential bureaucrats and landholders, helped spread Shia Islam, forming some of the largest Shia populations outside Iran. [223] Nader Shah , who overthrew the Safavids, attempted to improve relations with Sunnis by propagating the integration of Twelverism into Sunni Islam as a fifth madhhab, called Ja'farism, [224] which failed to gain recognition from the Ottomans. [225]
Modern era (18th–20th centuries)
Abdülmecid II was the last Caliph of Islam from the Ottoman dynasty .
Earlier in the 14th century, Ibn Taymiyya promoted a puritanical form of Islam, [226] rejecting philosophical approaches in favour of simpler theology, [226] and called to open the gates of itjihad rather than blind imitation of scholars. [227] He called for a jihad against those he deemed heretics, [228] but his writings only played a marginal role during his lifetime. [229] During the 18th century in Arabia, Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab , influenced by the works of Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Qayyim , founded a movement called Wahhabi to return to what he saw as unadultered Islam. [230] [231] He condemned many local Islamic customs, such as visiting the grave of Muhammad or saints, as later innovations and sinful [231] [232] and destroyed sacred rocks and trees, Sufi shrines, the tombs of Muhammad and his companions and the tomb of Husayn at Karbala, a major Shia pilgrimage site. [232] [233] [234] He formed an alliance with the Saud family , which, by the 1920s, completed their conquest of the area that would become Saudi Arabia . [232] [235] Ma Wanfu and Ma Debao promoted salafist movements in the 19th century such as Sailaifengye in China after returning from Mecca but were eventually persecuted and forced into hiding by Sufi groups. [236] Other groups sought to reform Sufism rather than reject it, with the Senusiyya and Muhammad Ahmad both waging war and establishing states in Libya and Sudan respectively. [237] In India, Shah Waliullah Dehlawi attempted a more conciliatory style against Sufism and influenced the Deobandi movement. [238] In response to the Deobandi movement, the Barelwi movement was founded as a mass movement, defending popular Sufism and reforming its practices. [239] [240]
The Muslim world was generally in political decline starting the 1800s, especially compared to non-Muslim European powers. Earlier, in the 15th century, the Reconquista succeeded in ending the Muslim presence in Iberia . By the 19th century, the British East India Company had formally annexed the Mughal dynasty in India. [241] As a response to Western Imperialism , many intellectuals sought to reform Islam . [242] Islamic modernism , initially labelled by Western scholars as Salafiyya , embraced modern values and institutions such as democracy while being scripture oriented. Notable forerunners in the movement include Muhammad 'Abduh and Jamal al-Din al-Afghani . [243] Abul A'la Maududi helped influence modern political Islam . [244] [245] Similar to contemporary codification , sharia was for the first time partially codified into law in 1869 in the Ottoman Empire's Mecelle code. [246]
The Ottoman Empire dissolved after World War I , the Ottoman Caliphate was abolished in 1924 [247] and the subsequent Sharifian Caliphate fell quickly, [248] [249] [250] thus leaving Islam without a Caliph . [250] Pan-Islamists attempted to unify Muslims and competed with growing nationalist forces, such as pan-Arabism . [251] [252] The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), consisting of Muslim-majority countries , was established in 1969 after the burning of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem . [253]
Contact with industrialized nations brought Muslim populations to new areas through economic migration. Many Muslims migrated as indentured servants (mostly from India and Indonesia) to the Caribbean, forming the largest Muslim populations by percentage in the Americas. [254] Migration from Syria and Lebanon contributed to the Muslim population in Latin America . [255] The resulting urbanization and increase in trade in sub-Saharan Africa brought Muslims to settle in new areas and spread their faith, [256] likely doubling its Muslim population between 1869 and 1914. [257]
Contemporary era (20th century–present)

Forerunners of Islamic modernism influenced Islamist political movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood and related parties in the Arab world, [258] [259] which performed well in elections following the Arab Spring , [260] Jamaat-e-Islami in South Asia and the AK Party , which has democratically been in power in Turkey for decades. In Iran , revolution replaced a secular monarchy with an Islamic state . Others such as Sayyid Rashid Rida broke away from Islamic modernists [261] and pushed against embracing what he saw as Western influence. [262] The group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant would even attempt to recreate the modern gold dinar as their monetary system. While some of those who broke away were quietist , others believed in violence against those opposing them, even against other Muslims. [263]
In opposition to Islamic political movements, in 20th century Turkey, the military carried out coups to oust Islamist governments, and headscarves were legally restricted, as also happened in Tunisia. [264] [265] In other places, religious authority was co-opted and is now often seen as puppets of the state. For example, in Saudi Arabia, the state monopolized religious scholarship [266] and, in Egypt, the state nationalized Al-Azhar University , previously an independent voice checking state power. [267] Salafism was funded in the Middle East for its quietism. [268] Saudi Arabia campaigned against revolutionary Islamist movements in the Middle East, in opposition to Iran. [269]
Muslim minorities of various ethnicities have been persecuted as a religious group. [270] This has been undertaken by communist forces like the Khmer Rouge , who viewed them as their primary enemy to be exterminated since their religious practice made them stand out from the rest of the population, [271] the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang [272] and by nationalist forces such as during the Bosnian genocide . [273] Myanmar military's Tatmadaw targeting of Rohingya Muslims has been labeled as a crime against humanity by the UN and Amnesty International, [274] [275] while the OHCHR Fact-Finding Mission identified genocide , ethnic cleansing, and other crimes against humanity. [276]
The advancement of global communication has facilitated the widespread dissemination of religious knowledge. The adoption of the hijab has grown more common [277] and some Muslim intellectuals are increasingly striving to separate scriptural Islamic beliefs from cultural traditions. [278] Among other groups, this access to information has led to the rise of popular "" televangelist "" preachers, such as Amr Khaled , who compete with the traditional ulema in their reach and have decentralized religious authority. [279] [280] More ""individualized"" interpretations of Islam [281] notably involve Liberal Muslims who attempt to align religious traditions with contemporary secular governance, [282] [283] an approach that has been criticized by some regarding its compatibility. [284] [285] Moreover, secularism is perceived as a foreign ideology imposed by invaders and perpetuated by post-colonial ruling elites , [286] and is frequently understood to be equivalent to anti-religion . [287]
Demographics
See also: Islam by country and Muslim population growth
World percentage of Muslims by country [ needs update ]
As of 2020, about 24% of the global population, or about 1.9 billion people, are Muslims. [7] [10] [288] [289] [290] [291] In 1900, this estimate was 12.3%, [292] in 1990 it was 19.9% [256] and projections suggest the proportion will be 29.7% by 2050. [293] Pew Research estimates that 87–90% of Muslims are Sunni and 10–13% are Shia. [294] Approximately 49 countries are Muslim-majority , [295] [296] [297] [298] [299] [300] with 62% of the world's Muslims living in Asia, and 683 million adherents in Indonesia , [301] Pakistan , India , and Bangladesh alone. [302] [303] [304] Arab Muslims form the largest ethnic group among Muslims in the world, [305] followed by Bengalis [306] [307] and Punjabis . [308] Most estimates indicate China has approximately 20 to 30 million Muslims (1.5% to 2% of the population). [309] [310] Islam in Europe is the second-largest religion after Christianity in many countries, with growth rates due primarily to immigration and higher birth rates of Muslims in 2005, [311] accounting for 4.9% of all of Europe's population in 2016. [312]
Religious conversion has no net impact on the Muslim population growth as ""the number of people who become Muslims through conversion seems to be roughly equal to the number of Muslims who leave the faith."" [313] Although, Islam is expected to experience a modest gain of 3 million through religious conversion between 2010 and 2050, mostly from Sub Saharan Africa (2.9 million). [314] [315]
According to a report by CNN , ""Islam has drawn converts from all walks of life, most notably African-Americans"". [316] In Britain , around 6,000 people convert to Islam per year and, according to an article in the British Muslims Monthly Survey, the majority of new Muslim converts in Britain were women. [317] According to The Huffington Post, ""observers estimate that as many as 20,000 Americans convert to Islam annually"", most of them being women and African-Americans . [318] [319]
By both percentage and total numbers, Islam is the world's fastest growing major religious group, and is projected to be the world's largest by the end of the 21st century, surpassing that of Christianity . [320] [293] It is estimated that, by 2050, the number of Muslims will nearly equal the number of Christians around the world, ""due to the young age and high fertility rate of Muslims relative to other religious groups."" [293]

The official logo of Kerala Tourism
Kerala , a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of southwestern India , is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic Traveler , [1] Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful backwaters. [2] Kerala has unique culture and traditions coupled with its varied demography . Several international agencies ranging from UNESCO to National Geographic have recognised the state's tourism potential. [3] Kerala was named by TIME magazine in 2022 among the 50 extraordinary destinations to explore in its list of the World's Greatest Places. [4] In 2023, Kerala was listed at the 13th spot in The New York Times ' annual list of places to visit and was the only tourist destination listed from India. [5]
Jatayu Earth's Center Nature Park
Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination, with most tourism circuits concentrated around the north of the country. Aggressive marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation —the government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the state—laid the foundation for the growth of the tourism industry. In the decades that followed, Kerala Tourism was able to transform itself into one of the niche holiday destinations in India. The tag line Kerala – God's Own Country was adopted in its tourism promotions and became a global superbrand . Kerala is regarded as one of the destinations with the highest brand recall. [6] In 2010, Kerala attracted 660,000 foreign tourist arrivals. [7]
Kerala is a popular destination for both domestic as well as foreign tourists. Kerala is well known for its beaches, backwaters in Alappuzha and Kollam , mountain ranges and wildlife sanctuaries. Other popular attractions in the state include the beaches at Kovalam , Muzhappilangad , Bekal and Kappad ; backwater tourism and lake resorts around Ashtamudi Lake , Kollam ; hill stations and resorts at Munnar , Wayanad , Nelliampathi , Vagamon and Ponmudi ; and national parks and wildlife sanctuaries at Wayanad , Periyar , Parambikulam , Silent Valley National Park and Eravikulam National Park . The "" backwaters "" region—an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that centre on Vembanad Lake , also see heavy tourist traffic. Heritage sites, such as the Padmanabhapuram Palace , Hill Palace , and Mattancherry Palace , are also visited. To further promote tourism in Kerala, the Grand Kerala Shopping Festival was started by the Government of Kerala in 2007. [8] Since then it has been held every year during the December–January period.
The state's tourism agenda promotes ecologically sustained tourism , which focuses on the local culture, wilderness adventures, volunteering and personal growth of the local population. Efforts are taken to minimize the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural environment and enhance the cultural integrity of local people. The state has also made deep inroads into MICE Tourism mainly centered at Kochi . [9]
Historical context
[ edit ]
Resorts dot the lengths and breadths of Kerala.
Since its incorporation as a state, Kerala's economy largely operated under welfare -based democratic socialist principles. This mode of development, though it resulted in a high Human Development Index and standard of living among the people, led to an economic stagnation in the 1980s (growth rate are 2.3% annually). [10] This apparent paradox—high human development and low economic development—led to a large number of educated unemployed seeking jobs overseas, especially in the Gulf countries .[ citation needed ] Due to a large number of expatriates, many travel operators and agencies set up shop in the state to facilitate their travel needs. However, the trends soon reciprocated, with the travel agencies noticing the unrealised potential of the state as a tourist destination. The first travel agency in Kerala, Kerala Travels, was founded by Col G.V. Raja of the Travancore royal family along with P.G.C. Pillai.[ citation needed ]
Number of tourists by nationality
No.
35,066
As of 2019 [11]
By 1986, tourism had gained an industry status. Kerala Tourism subsequently adopted the tagline God's Own Country in its advertisement campaigns. Aggressive promotion in print and electronic media was able to invite a sizable investment in the hospitality industry. By the early 2000s, tourism had grown into a full-fledged, multi-billion-dollar industry in the state. The state was able to carve a niche for itself in the world tourism industry, thus becoming one of the places with the ""highest brand recall"". [12] In 2003, Kerala, became one of the fastest-growing tourism destination in the world. [13]
In 2012, National Geographic 's Traveller magazine named Kerala as one of the ""ten paradises of the world"" and ""50 must see destinations of a lifetime"". Travel and Leisure also described Kerala as ""One of the 100 great trips for the 21st century"". In 2012, Kerala overtook the Taj Mahal to be the number one travel destination in Google's search trends for India. CNN Travel listed Kerala amongst its '19 best places to visit in 2019. Time magazine picked Kerala among 50 ‘extraordinary destinations’ across the globe to explore in 2022. The state was ranked ninth in the ‘World's Greatest Places' and was described as an ‘eco-tourism hot spot'. [14] In 2023, The New York Times selected Kerala as one of the 52 must-see tourism destinations in the world. Kerala was selected as thirteenth in the list and was the only state in the list from India. [15]

Kovalam beach
Flanked on the western coast by the Arabian Sea , Kerala one of the  long coastline of 580 km (360 mi); all of which is virtually dotted with sandy beaches. Kovalam beach near Thiruvananthapuram was among the first beaches in Kerala to attract tourists. Rediscovered by back-packers and tan-seekers in the 1960s and followed by hordes of hippies in the 1970s, Kovalam today is one of  the most visited beaches in the state. [17] [18] [19]
Other popularly visited beaches in the state include those at Kappad , Alappuzha , Kozhikode [ citation needed ] Beach, Marari Beach (Mararikulam, Alappuzha), Thumpoly (thumpoly beach ) Alappuzha, Alappuzha , Nattika (Thrissur), Vadanappilly beach (Thrissur), Cherai Beach , Ponnani beach , Bekal , Kappad Beypore beach , Marari beach, Fort Kochi , and Varkala . The Muzhappilangad Beach at Kannur and Thikkodi Beach at Kozhikode are the only two drive-in beach in India. Marari beach was rated as one of the world's top five Hammock Beaches by the National Geographic survey and has been cited [20] in the international press.
Backwaters

The backwaters in Kerala are a chain of brackish lagoons and lakes lying parallel to the Arabian Sea coast (known as the Malabar Coast ). Houseboat or Kettuvallam rides in  backwaters are a major tourist attraction in kerala. Backwater tourism is centered mostly around of Kerala like Alleppey , Kumarakom , Ashtamudi Lake , Kollam , Ponnani , Kavvayi Backwaters , Vembanad and Bekal . Boat races held during festival seasons are also a major tourist attraction in the backwater regions.
The backwater network includes large lakes such as the Ashtamudi Lake , the largest among them, linked by 1500 km of canals, both man-made and natural and fed by several rivers, and extending virtually the entire length of Kerala state. The backwaters were formed by the action of waves and shore currents creating low barrier islands across the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the Western Ghats range. [21]
Hill stations

Eastern Kerala consists of land encroached upon by the Western Ghats ; the region thus includes high mountains, gorges, and deep-cut valleys. The Western Ghats is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the 36 biodiversity hotspots in the world. The wildest lands are covered with dense forests, while other regions lie under tea and coffee plantations (established mainly in the 19th and 20th centuries) or other forms of cultivation.
The Western Ghats rise an average to 1500 m elevation above sea level. Some of the popular hill stations in the region are Munnar , Vagamon , Paithalmala , Wayanad , Nelliyampathi , Nilambur , Elapeedika , Peermade , Thekkady , Ponmudi and Kalvary Mount .
Wildlife
Athirappilly Falls at Thrissur . Wildlife of Kerala is mainly concentrated in the forests of Western Ghats
Most of Kerala , whose native habitat consists of wet evergreen rainforests at lower elevations and highland deciduous and semi- evergreen forests in the east, is subject to a humid tropical climate. However, significant variations in terrain and elevation have resulted in a land whose biodiversity registers as among the world's most significant. Most of Kerala's significantly biodiverse tracts of wilderness lie in the evergreen forests of its easternmost districts. Kerala also hosts two of the world's Ramsar Convention -listed wetlands : Lake Sasthamkotta and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands are noted as being wetlands of international importance . There are also numerous protected conservation areas, including 1455.4 km2 of the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve . In turn, the forests play host to such major fauna as Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), Nilgiri tahr (Nilgiritragus hylocrius), and grizzled giant squirrel (Ratufa macroura). [22] More remote preserves, including Silent Valley National Park in the Kundali Hills, harbour endangered species such as the lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus), Indian sloth bear (Melursus (Ursus) ursinus ursinus), and gaur (the so-called ""Indian bison""—Bos gaurus). More common species include Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), chital (Axis axis), sambar (Cervus unicolor), gray langur , flying squirrel , swamp lynx (Felis chaus kutas), boar (Sus scrofa), a variety of catarrhine Old World monkey species, gray wolf (Canis lupus), and common palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). Many reptiles, such as king cobra , viper , python , various turtles and crocodiles are to be found in Kerala—again, disproportionately in the east. Kerala's avifauna include endemics like the Sri Lanka frogmouth (Batrachostomus moniliger), Oriental bay owl , large frugivores like the great hornbill (Buceros bicornis) and Indian grey hornbill , as well as the more widespread birds such as peafowl , Indian cormorant , jungle and hill myna , Oriental darter , black-hooded oriole , greater racket-tailed and black drongoes , bulbul (Pycnonotidae), species of kingfisher and woodpecker , jungle fowl , Alexandrine parakeet , and assorted ducks and migratory birds. Additionally, freshwater fish such as kadu ( stinging catfish —Heteropneustes fossilis) and brackishwater species such as Choottachi ( orange chromide —Etroplus maculatus, valued as an aquarium specimen) also are native to Kerala's lakes and waterways.

Satavahana dynasty
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Indian dynasty (2nd century BCE – 3rd century CE)
Satavahana Empire
Approximate extent of the Satavahana Empire, in the early 1st century CE. [1]
Capital
e
The Satavahanas ( /ˌsɑːtəˈvɑːhənə/ ; Sādavāhana or Sātavāhana, [9] IAST : Sātavāhana), also referred to as the Andhras (also Andhra-bhṛtyas or Andhra-jatiyas) in the Puranas , were an ancient Indian dynasty . Most modern scholars believe that the Satavahana rule began in the late second century BCE and lasted until the early third century CE, although some assign the beginning of their rule to as early as the 3rd century BCE based on the Puranas , but uncorroborated by archaeological evidence. The Satavahana kingdom mainly comprised the present-day Andhra Pradesh , Telangana , and Maharashtra . At different times, their rule extended to parts of modern Gujarat , Madhya Pradesh , and Karnataka . The dynasty had different capital cities at different times, including Kotalingala (Telangana), Pratishthana (Paithan) and Amaravati ( Dharanikota ).
The origin of the dynasty is uncertain, but according to the Puranas , their first king overthrew the Kanva dynasty . In the post- Maurya era, the Satavahanas established peace in the Deccan region and resisted the onslaught of foreign invaders. In particular their struggles with the Saka ( Western Satraps ) went on for a long time. The dynasty reached its zenith under the rule of Gautamiputra Satakarni and his successor Vasisthiputra Pulamavi . The kingdom had fragmented into smaller states by the early 3rd century CE.
The Satavahanas were early issuers of Indian state coinage struck with images of their rulers. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade and the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India .
Origins
The date and place of origin of the Satavahanas, as well as the meaning of the dynasty's name, are a matter of debate among historians. Some of these debates have happened in the context of regionalism , with the present-day Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka and Telangana being variously claimed as the original homeland of the Satavahanas. [10]
Etymology
Early coin of Satakarni I (70-60 BCE). Obverse legend:
(𑀲𑀺𑀭𑀺) 𑀲𑀸
𑀡𑀺(𑀲), (Siri) Sātakaṇi(sa). [11]
Śātavāhana, Śālivāhana, Śātakarṇi seem to be Sanskritised versions of the indigenous name Sātakaṇi, which appear as Sālavāhaṇa in Prakrit vernacular. [12]
According to one theory, the word ""Satavahana"" ( Brahmi script :
𑀲𑀸𑀤𑀯𑀸𑀳𑀦 Sādavāhana or
𑀲𑀸𑀢𑀯𑀸𑀳𑀦 Sātavāhana, [9] IAST : Sātavāhana) is a Prakrit form of the Sanskrit Sapta-Vahana (""driven by seven""; in Hindu mythology , the chariot of the sun god is drawn by seven horses). This would indicate that the Satavahanas originally claimed association with the legendary solar dynasty , as was common in ancient India. [13] According to Inguva Kartikeya Sarma , the dynasty's name is derived from the words sata (""sharpened"", ""nimble"" or ""swift"") and vahana (""vehicle""); the expression thus means ""one who rides a nimble horse"". [14]
Another theory connects their name to the earlier Satiyaputa dynasty. Yet another theory derives their name from the Munda words Sadam (""horse"") and Harpan (""son""), implying ""son of the performer of a horse sacrifice "". [15] Several rulers of the dynasty bear the name or title ""Satakarni"". Satavahana, Satakarni, Satakani and Shalivahana appear to be variations of the same word. Damodar Dharmanand Kosambi theorised that the word ""Satakarni"" is derived from the Munda words sada (""horse"") and kon (""son""). [16]
The Puranas use the name ""Andhra"" for the Satavahanas. The term ""Andhra"" may refer to the ethnicity or territory of the dynasty (see Original homeland below). It does not appear in the dynasty's own records. [17]
The Tamil epic Cilappatikaram mentions a ""Nurruvar Kannar"", who helped Chera king Senguttuvan during his Himalayan campaign. The direct translation of the term Nurruvar Kannar is ""the hundred Karnas"" or ""Satakarni""; Nurruvar Kannar has therefore been identified with the Satavahana dynasty. [18] [19] [20]
The Kathasaritsagara ascribes a mythical etymology in which a widowed, childless king named Deepakarni was prophesied to find a lion-riding child as his heir. During a jungle hunt, he found such a child riding a yaksha -turned-lion named Sāta. After adoption, the child became the king eventually and came to be known as Sātavāhana or Sāta-supported.[ citation needed ]
Original homeland
Early sculpture from Pauni , ancient Vidarbha , where coins of Satakarni were also found. [21] [22] Pillar with Naga Mucalinda protecting the throne of the Buddha at Pauni (Bhandara District). 2nd-1st century BCE. National Museum of India . [23]
According to Historian R.G Bhandarkar's , Maharashtra is named after people known as Rastrika or Rattha. [24] Maha - great, and rashtrika - either a sanskrit term of Rātta or a term applied generally to chiefs ruling in the Deccan. [25] [26] the name of a tribe or dynasty of chiefs ruling in the Deccan region. [27] An alternate theory states that the term is derived from mahā (""great"") and ratha /rathi ("" chariot ""/""charioteer or warrior""). There is some evidence in support of this argument. The stone inscriptions at Naneghat , Bhaja , Karla (all Pune district), and Kanheri (near Borivali in Mumbai) mention Maharaṭhino and Maharathi which are masculine and feminine forms of adjectives referring to the group of people from Maharashtra . [27] [26] [28] [29]
The use of the names ""Andhra"" and ""Andhra-Jatiya"" in the Puranas has led some scholars, such as E. J. Rapson and R.G Bhandarkar , to believe that the dynasty originated in the eastern Deccan region (the historic Andhra region, present-day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana ). [30] [31] At Kotilingala in Telangana, coins bearing the legend ""Rano Siri Chimuka Satavahanasa"" were found. [32] Epigraphist and numismatist P. V. P. Sastry initially identified Chimuka with the dynasty's founder Simuka, [33] Coins attributed to Simuka's successors Kanha and Satakarni I were also discovered at Kotilingala. [34] Based on these discoveries, historians such as Ajay Mitra Shastri, D. R. Reddy, S. Reddy, and Shankar R. Goyal theorised that Kotlingala was the original home of the Satavahanas. Ajay Mitra Shastri stated that the finding of the coins at Kotilingala give ""a clear pointer to the region where we have to locate the original center of the Satavahana political authority."" [35] However, the coin samples from Kotlingala are small, and it is not certain if these coins were minted there or reached there from somewhere else. [36] Moreover, the identification of Chimuka of Kotilingala with the dynasty's founder Simuka has been contested by several scholars including P. L. Gupta and I. K. Sarma , who identified Chimuka as a later ruler. [37] [38] P. V. P. Sastry also later changed his view and stated that the two kings were different. [33] In addition to the Kotilinga find, a coin of the Satavahana prince Saktikumara, who was in the fourth generation of the founder, has been reported as a stratified find from the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. [35] As for the Puranas, these texts could have been compiled at a later date and it is not certain if the Satavahanas were referred to as Andhras during their time. [38] [39]
Another section of scholars believe that the Satavahanas originated in western Deccan (present-day Maharashtra ). [30] All four extant inscriptions from the early Satavahana period (c. 1st century BCE) have been found in and around this region. One of the earliest known Satavahana inscriptions was that found at Cave No.19 of the Pandavleni Caves in Nashik district , which was issued during the reign of Kanha (100–70 BCE). [40] An inscription found at Naneghat was issued by Nayanika (or Naganika), the widow of Satakarni I ; another inscription found at Naneghat has been dated to the same period on a paleographic basis. A slightly later inscription dated to the reign of Satakarni II has been found at Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh , located to the north of Maharashtra. [10] The majority of the other Satavahana inscriptions have also been found in western Deccan. [36] On the other hand, the epigraphic evidence from eastern Deccan does not mention the Satavahanas before the 4th century CE. [38] At Nevasa , a seal and coins attributed to Kanha have been discovered. [41] Coins attributed to Satakarni I have also been discovered at Nashik, Nevasa, and Pauni in Maharashtra (besides places in eastern Deccan and present-day Madhya Pradesh). [32] Based on this evidence, some historians argue that the Satavahanas initially came to power in the area around their capital Pratishthana (modern Paithan, Maharashtra) and then expanded their territory to eastern Deccan. [42] Carla Sinopoli cautions that the inference about the western Deccan origin of the Satavahanas is ""tentative at best"" given the small sample of early inscriptions. [43]

Naneghat inscription. Dated to 70-60 BCE, in the reign of Satakarni I . [10]
Kanha's Pandavleni mentions the term maha-matra (officer-in-charge), which indicates that the early Satavahanas followed the Mauryan administrative model. [44] C. Margabandhu theorised that the Satavahanas were called Andhras because they were natives of eastern Deccan (the Andhra region), although they first established their empire in western Deccan after having served as Mauryan subordinates. Himanshu Prabha Ray (1986) opposes this theory, stating that the Andhra was originally an ethnic term, and did not come to denote the geographical region of eastern Deccan until well after the Satavahana period. [10] According to Vidya Dehejia , the writers of the Puranas (which could have been written after the Satavahana period) mistook the Satavahana presence in eastern Deccan as evidence for their origin in that region, and wrongly labelled them as ""Andhra"". [45]
Puranas called the Satavahana kings as Andhra, Andhra-bhṛtya, or Andhra-jatiya. Andhra is both a tribal and a territorial name, the latter territorial denotation of present Telugu lands came into usage only well after the Satavahana period had ended, which meant that the term Andhra represented only the Andhra tribe (who had originated in North India along the Yamuna river banks as per Rigveda) and not the present Andhra region or its Telugu people. The term Andhrabhrityas (Andhra servants) may imply two things, one being that the Andhras were originally servants of the Mauryas or the Sungas. The other one, as per some scholars is that the expression is taken to indicate the servants of some other Andhra rulers. These scholars also suggest Kannada origin for the Satavahanas meaning that the dynasty originated in present-day Karnataka , and initially owed allegiance to some Andhra rulers. [46] A Satavahana inscription found on a slab of the upper drum (medhi) of the Kanaganahalli mahastupa mentions year 16 of Vasisthiputra Sri Chimuka Satavahana's reign, which can be dated from ca. 110 BCE. [47] [48] [49] V. S. Sukthankar theorised that the territorial division Satavahani-Satahani (Satavahanihara or Satahani-rattha), in present-day Bellary district , was the homeland of the Satavahana family. [50] However, Dr. Gopalchari challenged Sukthankar's theory by pointing out that not a single inscription of the early Satavahanas is found in Bellary District and that the only Satavahana inscription in Bellary District was that of Pulumavi, who belongs to the later-phase of Satavahana history. [51] A stupa in Kanaganahalli village of Karnataka, dated between the first century BCE and first century CE, features limestone panels depicting portraits of Chimuka (Simuka), Satakani (Satakarni) and other Satavahana rulers. [52] As per historian Parmanand Gupta, in the medieval times, Srisailam region or the Sriparvata area was known as Kannadu and Kannavisaya which is the contracted form of Satakarninadu and Satakarnivisaya, which seem to be identical with the territorial indicator Satavahanihara of the Myakadoni inscription of Pulumayi or the Satavahaniratta of the Hirahadagalli grant consisting of the Ballari region indicated to be the original homeland of the Satavahanas as per another historian V. S. Sukthankar. [53]
Varna
The varna of the dynasty is debated by modern scholars, who have variously argued for Shudra , Kshatriya , and Brahmana origins of the dynasty. [54]
The Puranas call the founder of the Satavahana family a vṛṣala (Shudra or low-born). [55]
The Nashik inscription of Gautami Balashri describes her son Gautamiputra Satakarni as eka-bamhana (Sanskrit: eka-brahmana). Some scholars, such as V.V. Mirashi , have interpreted the term as ""sole Brahmana"", and argued that Satavahanas were Brahmanas. [56] Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri interprets the term as ""unique Brahmana"", and notes that the inscription also describes Gautamiputra as ""the destroyer of the pride and conceit of Kshatriyas"", which according to him strongly suggests that Gautamiputra claimed to be a Brahmana. [57]
The critics of this theory point out that Gautamiputra's family had matrimonial relations with the non-Brahmana Shakas , and the Satavahanas could not have been Brahmanas because the same inscription also describes Gautamiputra as the one who stopped admixture of varnas (vinivatita chatu vana sankara). [58] [59] Historian V. Sundara Rama Sastry argues that the interpretation of the term ""eka-bamhana"" as ""the only Brahmana"" does not make sense as the king was obviously not the only member of his varna: instead, he interprets the term as an epithet indicating that the king ""excelled even the Brahmans"". [56] Historian R. G. Bhandarkar interprets the term ""the only protector"" of the Brahmanas. [60]
Some Jain works and the Dvātriṃśat-Puttalikā represent Shalivahana (whom some modern scholars identify as a Satavahana king) as of mixed Brahmana and Naga origin. Based on this, some scholars, such as D.C. Sircar , theorize that the Satavahanas were originally non-Brahmanas who started claiming Brahmana status after establishing matrimonial relations with some Brahmana families. [61]
History
Information about the Satavahanas comes from the Puranas , some Buddhist and Jain texts, the dynasty's inscriptions and coins, and foreign (Greek and Roman) accounts that focus on trade. [62] The information provided by these sources is not sufficient to reconstruct the dynasty's history with absolute certainty. As a result, there are multiple theories about the Satavahana chronology. [63]

South Asia circa 150 BCE. [64]
Simuka is mentioned as the first king in a list of royals in a Satavahana inscription at Naneghat . The various Puranas state that the first king of the dynasty ruled for 23 years, and mention his name variously as Sishuka, Sindhuka, Chhismaka, Shipraka, etc. These are believed to be corrupted spellings of Simuka, resulting from copying and re-copying of manuscripts. [65] Simuka cannot be dated with certainty based on available evidence. Based on the following theories, the beginning of the Satavahana rule is dated variously from 271 BCE to 30 BCE. [66] According to the Puranas, the first Andhra king overthrew the Kanva rule. He is named as Balipuccha in some texts. [67] D. C. Sircar dated this event to c. 30 BCE, a theory supported by many other scholars. [63]
The Matsya Purana mentions that the Andhra dynasty ruled for around 450 years. As the Satavahana rule ended in the early 3rd century, the beginning of their rule can be dated to the 3rd century BCE. The Indica of Megasthenes (350 – 290 BCE) mentions a powerful tribe named ""Andarae"", whose king maintained an army of 100,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 1,000 elephants. If Andarae is identified with the Andhras, this can be considered additional evidence of Satavahana rule starting in the 3rd century BCE. The Brahmanda Purana states that ""the four Kanvas will rule the earth for 45 years; then (it) will again go to the Andhras"". Based on this statement, the proponents of this theory argue that the Satavahana rule began immediately after the Maurya rule, followed by a Kanva interregnum , and then, a revival of the Satavahana rule. According to one version of the theory Simuka succeeded the Mauryans. A variation of the theory is that Simuka was the person who restored the Satavahana rule by overthrowing the Kanvas; the compiler of the Puranas confused him with the founder of the dynasty. [44]
Most modern scholars believe that the Satavahana ruler began in the first century BCE and lasted until the second century CE. This theory is based on Puranic records as well as archaeological and numismatic evidence. The theory that dates their rule to an earlier period is now largely discredited because the various Puranas contradict each other, and are not fully supported by epigraphic or numismatic evidence. [17]
The oldest Satavahana inscription is the one found on a slab of the upper drum (medhi) of the Kanaganahalli Great Stupa mentioning year 16 of Vasisthiputra Sri Chimuka Satavahana's reign, which can be dated from ca. 110 BCE. [48] [49] [47]

Sanchi donations (50 BCE- 0 CE)
The southern gateway of the Great Stupa at Sanchi was, according to an inscription (see arrow), donated under the rule of ""King Satakarni"", probably Satakarni II .Sinopoli [36]
The inscription appears on the relief of a stupa at the center of the top architrave, at the rear. It is written in three lines in early Brahmi script over the dome of the stupa in this relief. [70] Dated circa 50 BCE- 0 CE.
Text of the inscription:

Simuka was succeeded by his brother Kanha (also known as Krishna), who extended the kingdom up to Nashik in the west. [71] [44] His successor Satakarni I conquered western Malwa , Anupa ( Narmada valley) and Vidarbha , taking advantage of the turmoil caused by Greek invasions of northern India. He performed Vedic sacrifices including Ashvamedha and Rajasuya . Instead of the Buddhists, he patronised Brahmins and donated a substantial amount of wealth to them. [15] The Hathigumpha inscription of the Kalinga king Kharavela mentions a king named ""Satakani"" or ""Satakamini"", who some [72] identify with Satakarni I. The inscription describes dispatching of an army and Kharavela's threat to a city. Since the inscription is only partially legible, different scholars interpret the events described in the inscription differently. According to R. D. Banerji and Sailendra Nath Sen, Kharavela sent out an army against Satakarni. [73] According to Bhagwal Lal, Satakarni wanted to avoid an invasion of his kingdom by Kharavela. So, he sent horses, elephants, chariots and men to Kharavela as a tribute. [74] According to Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya, Kharavela's army diverted its course after failing to advance against Satakarni. [75] According to Alain Daniélou, Kharavela was friendly with Satakarni, and only crossed his kingdom without any clashes. [76]
Satakarni's successor Satakarni II ruled for 56 years, during which he captured eastern Malwa from the Shungas . [77] This allowed him access to the Buddhist site of Sanchi , in which he is credited with the building of the decorated gateways around the original Mauryan Empire and Sunga stupas . [78] Satakarni II is known from a dedicatory inscription at Sanchi . [36] He was succeeded by Lambodara. The coins of Lambodara's son and successor Apilaka have been found in eastern Madhya Pradesh. [15] However, Andrew Ollett argues that there is only one Satakarni, as the alleged first Satakarni is assigned ten years, and the second, fifty years by other scholars, but the only dated inscription of this king is Candankheda seal from his reign's year 30, around 60 BCE, and he ruled ca. 88–42 BCE. [79] [80]
Art of Sanchi
The Satavahanas contributed greatly to the embellishment of the Buddhist stupa of Sanchi . It was heavily repaired under King Satakarni II. The gateways and the balustrade were built after 70 BCE, and appear to have been commissioned by the Satavahanas.  An inscription on the Southern Gateway records that it was the work of Satakarni II's royal architect Ananda. [81] An inscription records the gift of one of the top architraves of the Southern Gateway by the artisans of the Satavahana Emperor Satakarni :
Gift of Ananda, the son of Vasithi, the foreman of the artisans of rajan Siri Satakarni [82]

First Western Satraps invasion under Nahapana
See also: Saka-Satavahana Wars
Little is known about Apilaka's successors, except cryptic references to one Kuntala Satakarni. The next well-known ruler of the dynasty was Hāla , who composed Gaha Sattasai in Maharashtri Prakrit. Like Hala, his four successors also ruled for very short periods (a total of 12 years), indicating troubled times for the Satavahanas. [15]
Epigraphic and numismatic evidence suggests that the Satavahanas earlier controlled the northern Deccan Plateau , the northern Konkan coastal plains, and the mountain passes connecting these two regions. During 15–40 CE, their northern neighbours – the Western Kshatrapas – extended their influence into these regions. [83] The Western Kshatrapa ruler Nahapana is known to have ruled the former Satavahana territory, as attested by the inscriptions of his governor and son-in-law, Rishabhadatta . [84]
First revival
A coin of Nahapana restruck by the Satavahana king Gautamiputra Satakarni . Nahapana's profile and coin legend are still clearly visible.
The defeated "" Saka - Yavana - Palhava "" ( Brahmi script :
𑀲𑀓 𑀬𑀯𑀦 𑀧𑀮𑁆𑀳𑀯) mentioned in the Nasik cave 3 inscription of Queen Gotami Balasiri (end of line 5 of the inscription). [85]
The Satavahana power was revived by Gautamiputra Satakarni , who is considered the greatest of the Satavahana rulers. [71] Charles Higham dates his reign c. 103 – c. 127 CE. [71] S. Nagaraju dates it 106–130 CE, [86] the new consensus is shared by Shailendra Bhandare, Akira Shimada, and Oskar von Hinuber, who regard Gautamiputra Satakarni 's reign was ca. 60–85 CE, as it is evident from history that ""Gautamiputra Saatakarni"" in the year 78 CE defeated Vikramaditya of Ujjain, which in turn was celebrated and named ""Yug Aadi"" means Beginning of New Era (New Year for Andhra, Karnataka, Maharashtra (Gudi padwa), Telangana states). Ever since these states people followed  Saatavaahana calendar. [87] [88] [89] Andrew Ollett considers it as 60–84 CE. [90] The king defeated by him appears to have been the Western Kshatrapa ruler Nahapana , as suggested by Nahapana's coins overstuck with names and titles of Gautamiputra. [84] The Nashik prashasti inscription of Gautamiputra's mother Gautami Balashri, dated to the 20th year after his death, records his achievements. The most liberal interpretation of the inscription suggests that his kingdom extended from the present-day Rajasthan in the north to Krishna river in the south, and from Saurashtra in the west to Kalinga in the east. He assumed the titles Raja-Raja (King of Kings) and Maharaja (Great King), and was described as the Lord of Vindhya . [15]
During the last years of his reign, his administration was apparently handled by his mother, which could have been a result of an illness or military preoccupation. [15] According to the Nasik inscription made by his mother Gautami Balashri, he was the one ... [91]
… who crushed down the pride and conceit of the Kshatriyas ; who destroyed the Sakas ( Western Satraps ), Yavanas ( Indo-Greeks ) and Pahlavas ( Indo-Parthians ),... who rooted out the Khakharata family (the Kshaharata family of Nahapana ); who restored the glory of the Satavahana race.
Inscription of Queen Mother Gautami Balashri at Cave No.3 of the Pandavleni Caves in Nashik .
Gautamiputra was succeeded by his son Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi (or Pulumayi). According to Sailendra Nath Sen, Pulumavi ruled from 96 to 119 CE. [15] According to Charles Higham, he ascended the throne around 110 CE, [71] according to Shailendra Bhandare, Akira Shimada, and Oskar von Hinuber Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi ruled ca. 85–125 CE, [87] [92] [93] and Andrew Ollett considers it to be ca. 84–119 CE. [90] Pulumavi features in a large number of Satavahana inscriptions and his coins have been found distributed over a wide area. This indicates that he maintained Gautamiputra's territory, and ruled a prosperous kingdom. He is believed to have added the Bellary region to Satakarni's kingdom. His coins featuring ships with double mast have been found on the Coromandel Coast , indicating involvement in maritime trade and naval power. The old stupa at Amaravati was perhaps renovated during his reign. [15] though recent scholarship tends to spread the dates of this wider.
Second Western Satraps invasion under Rudradaman I
Coin of Vashishtiputra Satakarni .
Pulumavi's successor was his brother Vashishtiputra Satakarni . According to S. N. Sen he ruled during 120–149 CE; [15] according to Charles Higham, his regnal years spanned 138–145 CE. [71] He entered into a marriage alliance with the Western Satraps, marrying the daughter of Rudradaman I . [15]
The Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman I states that he defeated Satakarni, the lord of Dakshinapatha (Deccan), twice. It also states that he spared the life of the defeated ruler because of close relations: [71]
""Rudradaman (...) who obtained good report because he, in spite of having twice in fair fight completely defeated Satakarni, the lord of Dakshinapatha , on account of the nearness of their connection did not destroy him.""
Junagadh rock inscription
According to D. R. Bhandarkar and Dineshchandra Sircar , the ruler defeated by Rudradaman was Gautamiputra Satakarni. However, E. J. Rapson believed that the defeated ruler was his son Vasishthiputra Pulumavi . [94] Shailendra Nath Sen and Charles Higham believe that the defeated ruler was Vashishtiputra's successor Shivaskanda or Shiva Sri Pulumayi (or Pulumavi). [71] [15]
As a result of his victories, Rudradaman regained all the former territories previously held by Nahapana, except for the extreme south territories of Pune and Nasik . Satavahana dominions were limited to their original base in the Deccan and eastern central India around Amaravati .
Second revival
Coin of Yajna Sri Satakarni , British Museum .
Sri Yajna Sātakarni , the last person belonging to the main Satavahana dynastic line, briefly revived the Satavahana rule. According to S. N. Sen, he ruled during 170–199 CE. [15] Charles Higham dates the end of his reign to 181 CE. His coins feature images of ships, which suggest naval and marine trade success. [71] Wide distribution of his coins, and inscriptions at Nashik, Kanheri and Guntur indicate that his rule extended over both eastern and western parts of Deccan. He recovered much of the territory lost the Western Kshatrapas, and issued silver coinage, imitating them. During the last years of his reign, the Abhiras captured the northern parts of the kingdom, around Nashik region. [15]
Decline
After Yajna Satakarni, the dynasty was soon extinguished following the rise of its feudatories, perhaps on account of a decline in central power. [95] On the other hand, the Western Satraps would continue to prosper for the next two centuries, until their extinction by the Gupta Empire . Yajna Sri was succeeded by Madhariputra Swami Isvarasena. The next king Vijaya ruled for 6 years. His son Vasishthiputra Sri Chadha Satakarni ruled for 10 years. [15] Pulumavi IV, the last king of the main line, ruled until c. 225 CE. During his reign, several Buddhist monuments were constructed at sites including Nagarjunakonda and Amaravati . [71] Madhya Pradesh was also part of his kingdom. [15]
After the death of Pulumavi IV, the Satavahana empire fragmented into five smaller kingdoms: [15]
Northern part, ruled by a collateral branch of the Satavahanas (which ended in early 4th century [71] )
Eastern part ( Krishna - Guntur region), ruled by the Andhra Ikshvakus
South-western parts (northern Karanataka), ruled by the Chutus of Banavasi
South-eastern part, ruled by the Pallavas
Territorial extent
Main polities in Asia, circa -100. [96] [97] [98] [99]
The Satavahana territory included northern Deccan region, spanning the present-day Andhra Pradesh , Maharashtra and Telangana states. At times, their rule also extended to present-day Gujarat , Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh . The Nashik prashasti inscription issued by Gautami Balashri, the mother of Gautamiputra Satakarni , claims that her son ruled an extensive territory that stretched from Gujarat in the north to northern Karnataka in the south. It is not clear if Gautamiputra had effective control over these claimed territories. In any case, historical evidence suggests that his control over these territories did not last long. [100] Moreover, this realm was not continuous: many areas in this region remained under the control of the hunter-gatherers and other tribal communities. [101]
As per historian M. Govinda Pai , Ptolemy (100–170 CE) states that when Siro Polemaios ( Vasishthiputra Sri Pulumayi ) was ruling from his capital Paithan in the north (reign c. 85-125 CE), another Satavahana prince called Baleokouros or Baleokoura (Vilivayakura) was ruling from Hippokoura ( Huvina Hipparagi ) of Basavana Bagewadi taluk of Vijayapura district of present Karnataka in the south who was none other than his own son. Pai identifies this prince Vilivaya-kura as another form of Vilivaya Kumara (meaning the son of Vilivaya), and he goes on to prove that Vilivaya is indeed merely another rendering of Pulumayi which was transformed as per Prakrit rules, the spoken form of this language during that period, and due to common parlance. Thus, Vilivayakura means a son of Pulumayi who was ruling from Huvina Hipparagi in present Karnataka. Pai identifies all the 10 cities mentioned by Ptolemy as lying between the river Benda (or Binda) or Bhima river in the north and Banaouasei ( Banavasi ) in the south, viz. Nagarouris (Nagur), Tabaso (Tavasi), Inde ( Indi ), Tiripangalida ( Gadhinglaj ), Hippokoura ( Huvina Hipparagi ), Soubouttou ( Savadi ), Sirimalaga ( Malkhed ), Kalligeris ( Kalkeri ), Modogoulla ( Mudgal ) and Petirgala ( Pattadakal ), as being located in Northern Karnataka. [102]
The Satavahana capital kept shifting with time. The Nashik inscription describes Gautamiputra as the lord of Benakataka, suggesting that this was the name of his capital. Ptolemy (2nd century CE) mentioned Pratishthana (modern Paithan ) as the capital of Pulumavi. [100] At other times, the Satavahana capitals included Dharanikota and Junnar . [12] M. K. Dhavalikar theorised that the original Satavahana capital was located at Junnar, but had to be moved to Pratishthana because of Saka - Kushana incursions from the north-west. [103]
Several Satavahana-era inscriptions record grants to religious monasteries. The settlements most frequently mentioned as the residences of donors in these inscriptions include the sea ports of Sopara , Kalyan , Bharuch , Kuda (unidentified), and Chaul . The most frequently mentioned inland settlements include Dhanyakatakam/ Dharanikota , Junnar, Nashik , Paithan, and Karad . [100]
Other important Satavahana sites in western Deccan include Govardhana, Nevasa, Ter , and Vadgaon-Madhavpur. The ones in eastern Deccan include Amaravati, Dhulikatta, Kotalingala and Peddabankur. [104]
Administration
Ashoka with his Queens, at Sannati ( Kanaganahalli Stupa ), 1st-3rd century CE. The inscription ""Rāya Asoko"" (
𑀭𑀸𑀬 𑀅𑀲𑁄𑀓𑁄, ""King Ashoka"") in Brahmi script is carved on the relief. [105] [106] [107]
The Satavahanas followed the administration guidelines of the Shastras . Their government was less top-heavy than that of the Mauryans, and featured several levels of feudatories: [15]
Rajan, the hereditary rulers
Rajas, petty princes who struck coins in their own names
Maharathis, hereditary lords who could grant villages in their own names and maintained matrimonial relations with the ruling family
Mahabhojas
Mahasenapati (civil administrator under Pulumavi II; governor of a janapada under Pulumavi IV)
Mahatalavara (""great watchman"")
The royal princes (kumaras) were appointed as viceroys of the provinces. [15]
The ahara appears to have been the largest geographical subdivision of the Satavahana polity. Several inscriptions refer to aharas named after the governors appointed to rule them (e.g. Govardhanahara, Mamalahara, Satavanihara and Kapurahara). [100] This suggests that the Satavahanas attempted to build a formal administrative and revenue collection structure. [108]
The inscriptions of Gautamiputra Satakarni suggest the existence of a bureaucratic structure, although it is not certain how stable and effective this structure was. For example, two inscriptions from Nashik Cave 11 record donations of agricultural land to ascetic communities. They state that the ascetics would enjoy tax exemption and non-interference from the royal officials. The first inscription states that the grant was approved by Gautamiputra's minister Sivagupta on the king's verbal orders, and preserved by the ""great lords"". The second inscription records a grant by Gautamiputra and his mother, and mentions Syamaka as the minister of the Govardhana ahara. It states that the charter was approved by a woman named Lota, who according to archaeologist James Burgess ' interpretation, was the chief lady-in-waiting of Gautamiputra's mother. [109]
The Satavahana-era inscriptions mention three types of settlements: nagara (city), nigama (market town) and gāma (village). [100]
According to Sastri, ""the Satavahanas were described as 'lords of the three oceans' and promoted overseas colonization and trade. Under them, Buddhist art attained the superb forms of beauty and elegance preserved to this day in the cave-temples of western India and the survivals from the stupa of Amaravati, Goli, Nagarjunikonda"". [110] This tradition was followed by successors of Satavahana in the eastern and western Deccan. [110]
Economy
Indian ship on lead coin of Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi , testimony to the naval, seafaring and trading capabilities of the Satavahanas during the 1st–2nd century CE.
The Satavahanas participated in (and benefited from) economic expansion through intensification of agriculture, increased production of other commodities, and trade within and beyond the Indian subcontinent. [111]
During the Satavahana period, several large settlements emerged in the fertile areas, especially along the major rivers. The amount of land under agricultural use also expanded significantly, as a result of forest clearance and construction of irrigation reservoirs. [108]
The exploitation of sites with mineral resources may have increased during the Satavahana period, leading to the emergence of new settlements in these areas. Such sites facilitated commerce and crafts (such as ceramic ware). The increased craft production during the Satavahana period is evident from archaeological discoveries at sites such as Kotalingala , as well as epigraphic references to artisans and guilds . [108]
The Satavahanas controlled the Indian sea coast, and as a result, they dominated the growing Indian trade with the Roman Empire. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentions two important Satavahana trade centres: Pratishthana and Tagara. Other important urban centres included Kondapur, Banavasi and Madhavpur. Nanaghat was the site of an important pass that linked the Satavahana capital Pratishthana to the sea. [71]
Religion
The Pompeii Lakshmi ivory statuette was found in the ruin of Pompeii (destroyed in an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE). It is thought to have come from Bhokardan in the Satavahana realm in the first half of the 1st century CE. It testifies to Indo-Roman trade relations in the beginning of our era.
The Satavahanas patronized Brahmanism and Vedic sacrifices , and claimed Brahmanical status, [5] although they also made generous donations to Buddhist monasteries. [107] The lay people in the Satavahana period perhaps generally did not exclusively support a particular religious group . [83]
The Naneghat inscription of Nayanika, recorded on the walls of a cave, mentions that her husband Satakarni I performed several Vedic sacrifices, including ashvamedha (horse sacrifice), rajasuya (royal consecration), and agnyadheya (fire ceremony). [112] The inscription also records substantial fees paid to Brahmin priests and attendees for these sacrifices. For example, 10,001 cows were granted for the Bhagala-Dasaratra sacrifice; and 24,400 coins were granted for another sacrifice, whose name is not clear. [113]
A number of Buddhist monastic sites emerged in the Deccan region during the Satavahana period. However, the exact relations between these monasteries and the Satavahana government is not clear. [104] The Pandavleni Caves inscription issued during the reign of Kanha states that the cave was excavated by maha-matra (officer-in-charge) of the shramanas (non- Vedic ascetics). Based on this, Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya concludes that Kanha favoured Buddhism , and had an administrative department dedicated to the welfare of Buddhist monks. [44]
However, Carla M. Sinopoli notes that although there are some records of donations to the Buddhist monasteries by the Satavahana royals, the vast majority of the donations were made by the non-royals. The most common among these donors were merchants, and many of the monasteries were located along the important trade routes. [104] The merchants probably donated to the monasteries, because these sites facilitated trade by serving as rest houses, and possibly by directly participating in the trade. [5] The monasteries appear to have been an important venue for displaying charitable donations, including the donations made to non-Buddhists (especially Brahmins). [107]
Language
Most of the Satavahana inscriptions and coin legends are in a Middle Indo-Aryan language . [114] This language has been termed "" Prakrit "" by some modern scholars, but this terminology can be considered correct only if the term ""Prakrit"" is defined broadly to include every Middle Indo-Aryan language that is ""not exactly Sanskrit"". The language of the inscriptions is actually closer to Sanskrit than to the literary Prakrit used in the Gaha Sattasai anthology attributed to the Satavahana king Hala. [115]
The Satvahanas also used Sanskrit in political inscriptions, but rarely. [116] A fragmentary inscription found close to the Nashik prashasti of Gautamiputra Satakarni uses Sanskrit verses in vasanta-tilaka metre to describe a deceased king (probably Gautamiputra). A Sanskrit inscription found at Sannati probably refers to Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni, one of whose coins also features a Sanskrit legend. [114]
According to Gunadya, besides Sanskrit and Prakrit there is another language called 'Desi' which may mean the native language or the language of common man. Commenting on the Desi language Dr.D.C.Sircar remarks ""It was apparently Early Telugu which was in older times very much closer to Tamil than it is now was the mother tongue of the common people"". Later Satavahana kings like Gauthamiputra Satakarni, Vastistiputra pulamovi and Yajna Satakarni had their names in two languages i.e.; Prakrit and Desi (possibly Old Telugu ), a native language. [117]
The Satavahanas also issued bilingual coins featuring Middle Indo-Aryan language on one side, and Desi language (possibly Old Tamil ) on the other side. [118]
Inscriptions
Inscription of Gautamiputra Satakarni , Nasik Caves No.3, Inscription No.4. Circa 150 CE.
Several Brahmi script inscriptions are available from the Satavahana period, but most of these record donations to Buddhist institutions by individuals, and do not provide much information about the dynasty. The inscriptions issued by the Satavahana royals themselves also primarily concern religious donations, although some of them provide some information about the rulers and the imperial structure. [119]
The earliest extant Satavahana inscription is from Nashik Cave 19 , which states that the cave was commissioned by Mahamatra Saman of Nashik during the reign of king Kanha. [10]
At Naneghat , an inscription issued by Nayanika, the widow of Satakarni I , has been found. It records Nayanika's lineage and mentions the Vedic sacrifices performed by the royal family. [10] Another inscription at Naneghat comprises names of Satavahana royals, appearing as labels over their bas-relief portraits. The portraits are now completely eroded, but the inscription is believed to be contemporary to Nayanika's inscription on a paleographic basis. [36]
The next oldest Satavahana-era inscription appears on a sculpted gateway element of Stupa 1 at Sanchi . It states that the element was donated by Ananda, who was the son of Siri Satakarni's foreman of artisans. This inscription is probably from the reign of Satakarni II . [36]
Coinage
Satavahana bilingual coinage in Prakrit and Dravidian (possibly Old Telugu ) (c.150 CE)
Bilingual coinage of Sri Vasishthiputra Pulumavi in Prakrit and Dravidian (possibly Old Tamil ), and transcription of the obverse Prakrit legend.Obverse: Portrait of the king. Legend in Prakrit in the Brahmi script (starting at 12 o'clock):

Legend in Dravidian (more closer to Telugu , [120] and the Dravidian script, [120] essentially similar to the Brahmi script [121] (starting at 12 o'clock):
𑀅𑀭𑀳𑀡𑀓𑀼 𑀯𑀸𑀳𑀺𑀣𑀺 𑀫𑀸𑀓𑀡𑀓𑀼 𑀢𑀺𑀭𑀼 𑀧𑀼𑀮𑀼𑀫𑀸𑀯𑀺𑀓𑀼Arahaṇaku Vāhitti Mākaṇaku Tiru Pulumāviku [122] or: Aracanaku Vācitti Makaṇaku Tiru Pulumāviku [123] ""Of King Tiru Pulumavi, son of Vasishthi"" [121]
The Satavahanas were the earliest Indian rulers to issue their own coins with portraits of their rulers, starting with king Gautamiputra Satakarni , a practice derived from that of the Western Kshatrapas he defeated. [124] The Western Satraps themselves had been following the features of the coins of the Indo-Greek kings to the northwest. [125]
Thousands of lead, copper and potin Satavahana coins have been discovered in the Deccan region; a few gold and silver coins are also available. These coins do not feature uniform design or size, and suggest that multiple minting locations existed within the Satavahana territory, leading to regional differences in coinage. [119]
The coin legends of the Satavahanas, in all areas and all periods, used a Prakrit dialect without exception. In addition, some reverse coin legends are in Dravidian [120] (more similar to Telugu [126] [127] than Tamil , [120] [119] in the Dravidian script (similar to the Brahmi script apart from a few variations). [120] [121]
Several coins carry titles or matronyms that were common to multiple rulers (e.g. Satavahana, Satakarni, and Pulumavi), so the number of rulers attested by coinage cannot be determined with certainty. The names of 16 to 20 rulers appear on the various coins. Some of these rulers appear to be local elites rather than the Satavahana monarchs. [119]
The Satavahana coins give unique indications as to their chronology, language, and even facial features (curly hair, long ears and strong lips). They issued mainly lead and copper coins; their portrait-style silver coins were usually struck over coins of the Western Kshatrapa kings. The Satavahana coins also display various traditional symbols, such as elephants, lions, horses and chaityas ( stupas ), as well as the "" Ujjain symbol"", a cross with four circles at the end.

Cultural achievements
Satavahana architecture at Cave No.3 of the Pandavleni Caves in Nashik . This cave was probably started during the reign of Gautamiputra Satakarni, and was finished and dedicated to the Buddhist Samgha during the reign of his son Vasishthiputra Pulumavi , circa 150 CE.
The Satavahanas patronised the Prakrit language instead of Sanskrit . [15] The Satavahana king Hāla is famous for compiling the collection of Maharashtri poems known as the Gaha Sattasai ( Sanskrit : Gāthā Saptashatī), although from linguistic evidence it seems that the work now extant must have been re-edited in the succeeding century or two. Through this book, it was evident that agriculture was the main means of livelihood. Also many sorts of superstitions had prevailed. Additionally, Gunadhya, the minister of Hala, was the author of Brihatkatha . [128]
Sculptures
Madhukar Keshav Dhavalikar writes that ""The Satavahana sculptures unfortunately has never been recognized as an independent school in spite of the fact it has its own distinctive characteristic features. The earliest in point of time is that in the Bhaja Vihara cave which marks the beginning of sculptural art in the Satavahana dominion around 200BC. It is profusely decorated with carvings, and even pillars have a lotus capital crowned with sphinx-like mythic animals."" [129] Dhavalikar also writes that in Chankama ""the panel occurring on the west pillar of Northern Gateway portrays a very important event in Buddha's life. It depicts votaries, two each on either side of what looks like a ladder which actually is the promenade which Buddha is supposed to have walked. It is said that Buddha, after attaining Enlightment, spent four weeks near the Bodhi tree. Of these, the third week he spent walking along the promenade (chankama) to and fro."" [130]
Along with some of the above major Satavahana sculptures some more sculptures existed—namely, Dvarapala, Gajalaksmi, Shalabhanjikas, Royal Procession, Decorative pillar, etc. [131]
Bronze
Royal earrings, Andhra Pradesh , 1st century BCE.
Several metal figurines are found that could be attributed to the Satavahanas. A hoard of unique bronze objects were also found from Bramhapuri . Numerous articles obtained from there were Indian but also reflected Roman and Italian influence. A small statue of Poseidon, wine jugs, and a plaque depicting Perseus and Andromeda were also obtained from the house from where the objects were found. [132] The fine elephant in the Ashmolean Museum , the Yaksi image in the British Museum , [133] and the cornucopia found in Posheri, kept at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya [134] can also be attributed to the Satavahana period.
Architecture
The sculptures of the Amaravati Stupa and the wider Amaravati style represent the architectural development of the Satavahana periods. They built Buddhist stupas in Amravati (95 feet high). They also constructed a large number of stupas at Goli, Jaggiahpeta , Ghantasala, Amaravati Bhattiprolu, and Shri Parvatam. Caves IX and X, containing Ajanta paintings, were patronised by Satavahana, and the painting throughout the caves appear to have started with them. Ashokan Stupas were enlarged, the earlier bricks and wood works being replaced with stone works. The most famous of these monuments are the stupas, the most famous among them being the Amravati Stupa and the Nagarjunakonda Stupa.
Paintings
The Satavahana paintings are the earliest surviving specimens—excluding prehistoric rock art—in India, and they are to be found only at the Ajanta Caves . There were two phases of artistic activity of Ajanta: the first occurring in the 2nd to 1st centuries BCE, when Hinayana caves were excavated during Satavahana rule; the later in the second half of the 5th century under the Vakatakas. Vagaries of nature and some vandalism have taken a heavy toll on the Ajanta Caves. Only a few fragments related to the Satavahanas have survived in Caves No. 9 and 10, both of which are chaitya-grihas with stupas.
The most important surviving painting of the Satavahana period at Ajanta is the Chhadanta Jataka in Cave No. 10, but that, too, is only fragmentary. It is a painting of an elephant named Bodhisattva with six tusks, related to a mythological story. The human figures, both male and female, are typically Satavahanas, almost identical with their counterparts on the Sanchi Gateways so far as their physiognomy, costumes, and jewellery are concerned. The only difference is that the Sanchi figures have shed some of their weight. [135]
Art of Amaravati
Main article: Amaravati Stupa
The Satavahana rulers are also remarkable for their contributions to Buddhist art and architecture. They built great stupas in the Krishna River Valley, including the stupa at Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh . The stupas were decorated in marble slabs and sculpted with subjects including scenes from the life of the Buddha , portrayed in a characteristic slim and elegant style. The regional Amaravati style of sculpture also influenced the sculpture of Southeast Asia. [136]

The Godavari ( IAST : Godāvarī, [ɡod̪aːʋəɾiː] ) is India 's second longest river after the Ganga River and drains the third largest basin in India, covering about 10% of India's total geographical area. [5] Its source is in Trimbakeshwar , Nashik , Maharashtra . [6] It flows east for 1,465 kilometres (910 mi), draining the states of Maharashtra (48.6%), Telangana (18.8%), Andhra Pradesh (4.5%), Chhattisgarh (10.9%) and Odisha (5.7%). The river ultimately empties into the Bay of Bengal through an extensive network of distributaries. [7] Its 312,812 km2 (120,777 sq mi) drainage basin is one of the largest in the Indian subcontinent , with only the Ganga and Indus rivers having a larger drainage basin. [8] In terms of length, catchment area and discharge, the Godavari is the largest in peninsular India, and had been dubbed as the Dakshina Ganga (Southern Ganges ). [9]
The river has been revered in Hindu scriptures for many millennia and continues to harbour and nourish a rich cultural heritage . In the past few decades, the river has been barricaded by several barrages and dams , keeping a head of water (depth) which lowers evaporation. Its broad river delta houses 729 persons/km2 – nearly twice the Indian average population density and has a substantial risk of flooding, which in lower parts would be exacerbated if the global sea level were to rise. [10] [11]
Course
Bhadrachalam Temple during 2005 floods [12]
The Godavari originates in the Western Ghats of central India near Nashik in Maharashtra , 80 km (50 mi) from the Arabian Sea . It flows for 1,465 km (910 mi), first eastwards across the Deccan Plateau then turns southeast, entering the Eluru district and Alluri Sitharama Raju district of Andhra Pradesh, until it splits into two distributaries that widen into a large river delta at Dhavaleshwaram Barrage in Rajamahendravaram and then flows into the Bay of Bengal. [13]
The Godavari River has a coverage area of 312,812 km2 (120,777 sq mi), which is nearly one-tenth of the area of India and is equivalent to the area of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland put together. The river basin is considered to be divided into 3 sections:
Upper (source to the confluence with Manjira ),
Middle (between confluence of Manjira and Pranhita ) and
Lower (Pranhita confluence to mouth).
These put together account for 24.2% of the total basin area. [14] The rivers annual average water inflows are nearly 110 billion cubic metres. [15] Nearly 50% of the water availability is being harnessed. The water allocation from the river among the riparian states are governed by the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal . The river has highest flood flows in India and experienced recorded flood of 3.6 million cusecs in the year 1986 and annual flood of 1.0 million cusecs is normal. [16] [17]
Within Maharashtra
[ edit ]
The river originates in Maharashtra state and has an extensive course. The upper basin (origin to its confluence with Manjira ) of which lies entirely within the state, cumulatively draining an area as large as 152,199 km2 (58,764 sq mi) – about half the area of Maharashtra. [18] Within Nashik district , the river assumes a north-easterly course until it flows into the Gangapur Reservoir created by a dam of the same name. The reservoir along with the Kashypi Dam provides potable water to Nashik, one of the largest cities located on its banks. The river as it emerges through the dam, some 8 km (5.0 mi) upstream from Nashik, flows on a rocky bed undulated by a series of chasms and rocky ledges, resulting in the formation of two significant waterfalls – the Gangapur and the Someshwar waterfalls. The latter, located at Someshwar is more popularly known as the Dudhsagar Waterfall. [19] About 10 km (6.2 mi) east of Gangapur the river passes the town of Nashik where it collects its effluents in the form of the river Nasardi on its right bank.[ citation needed ]
About 0.5 km (0.31 mi) south of Nashik, the river bends sharply to the east, washing the base of a high cliff formerly the site of a Mughal fort, but which is now being eroded away by the action of floods. About 25 km (16 mi) below Nashik is the confluence of the Godavari and one of its tributaries, the Darna . The stream occupies, for nine months in the year, a small space in a wide and gravelly bed, the greyish banks being 4 to 6 m (13 to 20 ft) high, topped with a deep layer of black soil. A few kilometres after its meeting with the Darna, the Godavari swerves to the north-east, before the Banganga , from the north-west, meets it on the left. The course of the main stream then tends more decidedly south. At Nandur-Madhmeshwar, the Kadva , a second large affluent, brings considerable increase to the waters of the Godavari. The river begins its southeasterly course characteristic of rivers of the Deccan Plateau . The river exits the Niphad Taluka of Nashik and enters the Kopargaon taluka , Ahmednagar District . Within Ahmednagar District the river quickly completes its short course, flowing alongside the town of Kopargaon and reaching Puntamba . Beyond this, the river serves as a natural boundary between the following districts:[ citation needed ]
Ahmednagar and Aurangabad : Along the boundary here, it receives its first major tributary the Pravara River , draining the former district. The confluence is located at Pravarasangam. By virtue of a sub-tributary of Pravara – Mandohol, which originates in Pune District – the basin impinges the Pune district . The river at Paithan has been impounded by the Jayakwadi Dam forming the NathSagar Reservoir. Kalsubai located in Godavari basin, is the highest peak in Maharashtra.
Beed and Jalna
Beed and Parbhani : Located along here is its merger with Sindphana , an important tributary [20] which drains a considerably large area within Beed. The sub-tributary river Bindusara forms a landmark at Beed .
The river beyond, near the village Sonpeth, flows into Parbhani . In Parbhani district, the river flows through Gangakhed taluka. As mentioned above, the Godavari is also called Dakshinganga so the city is called as Gangakhed (meaning a village on the bank of Ganga). As per Hindu rituals this place is considered quite important for after death peace to flow ashes into the river.[ citation needed ]
Its course is relatively non-significant except for receiving two smaller streams – Indrayani and Masuli – merging at its left and right banks, respectively. Within the last taluka of the district Parbhani, Purna , the river drains a major tributary of the same name: Purna .[ citation needed ]
It then exits into the neighbouring district of Nanded where 10 km (6.2 mi) before reaching the town Nanded, it is impounded by the Vishnupuri Dam and thus with it, bringing Asia's largest lift irrigation projects to life. A little downstream from Nanded, the river receives Asna, a small stream, on its left bank. It then runs into the controversial Babli project soon ends its course within Maharashtra , albeit temporarily, at its merger with a major tributary – Manjira .[ citation needed ]
The river after flowing into Telangana, re-emerges to run as a state boundary separating the Mancherial , Telangana from Gadchiroli , Maharashtra. At the state border, it runs between Sironcha and Somnoor Sangam receiving one tributary at each of those nodal points – the Pranhita and subsequently the Indravati .[ citation needed ]
Within Telangana
[ edit ]
Road Bridge over Godavari River at Bhadrachalam
Godavari enters into Telangana in Nizamabad district at Kandakurthy where Manjira, Haridra rivers joins Godavari and forms Triveni Sangamam. The river flows along the border between Nirmal and Mancherial districts in the north and Nizamabad , Jagtial , Peddapalli districts to its south. About 12 km (7.5 mi) after entering Telangana it merges with the back waters of the Sriram Sagar Dam . The river after emerging through the dam gates, enjoys a wide river bed, often splitting to encase sandy islands. The river receives a minor but significant tributary Kadam river . It then emerges at its eastern side to act as a state border with Maharashtra only to later enter into Bhadradri Kothagudem district . In this district, the river flows through an important Hindu pilgrimage town – Bhadrachalam .[ citation needed ]
The river further swells after receiving a minor tributary Kinnerasani River and exits into Andhra Pradesh .
Within Andhra Pradesh
The river at Papi Hills near Rajamahendravaram in Andhra Pradesh .
Within the state of Andhra Pradesh , the river flows through hilly terrain of the Eastern Ghats known as the Papi hills which explains the narrowing of its bed as it flows through a gorge for a few km, only to re-widen at Polavaram . The deepest bed level of a submarine plunge pool in Godavari River, located 36 km upstream of Polavaram dam, is at 45 meters below the sea level. [21] Before crossing the Papi hills, it receives its last major tributary Sabari River on its left bank. The river upon reaching the plains begins to widen out until it reaches Rajamahendravaram . Arma Konda (1,680 m (5,510 ft)) is the highest peak in the Godavari river basin as well as in Eastern Ghats. [22]
Dowleswaram Barrage was constructed across the river in Rajamahendravaram. At Rajamahendravaram, the Godavari splits into two large branches which are called Gautami (Gautami Godavari) and Vasishta Godavari and five smaller branches.  Similarly, the Vasishta splits into two branches named Vasishta and Vainateya. These four branches which join the Bay of Bengal at different places, form a delta of length 170 km (110 mi) along the coast of the Bay of Bengal and is called the Konaseema region. This delta along with the delta of the Krishna River is called the Rice Granary of South India . [23]
Within Puducherry
[ edit ]
The Gautami which is the largest branch of the whole passes along Yanam enclave of Union territory of Puducherry and empties itself into sea at Point Godavery. [24] In fact, Yanam is bounded on south by Gautami branch and the Coringa River originates at Yanam which merges into the sea near Coringa village in Andhra Pradesh. [25]

It is commonly used in areal linguistics in contrast with the Sinophone languages of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area of the Sinosphere . Notably, unlike terms such as Lusophone or Francophone that refer to the multinational spread and influence of a single language with multiple dialects ( Portuguese and French respectively from the example), this term refers to all languages that are considered to originate in India, of which there are 22 recognised languages alone across several major language families, including Indo-European and Dravidian . It considers these collectively in regards to the influence of these languages on the languages of other countries, rather than from the perspective of the spread of the language only.
Influence
Main article: Sprachbund
The Tibeto-Burman family of languages, which extends over a huge geographic range, is characterized by great typological diversity, comprising languages that range from the highly tonal, monosyllabic , analytic type with practically no affixational morphology, like the Loloish languages , to marginally tonal or atonal languages with complex systems of verbal agreement morphology, like the Kiranti group of Nepal. This diversity is partly to be explained in terms of areal influences from Chinese on the one hand and Indo-Aryan languages on the other. [1] Matisoff proposed two large and overlapping areas combining cultural and linguistic features – the ""Sinosphere"" and the ""Indosphere"", influenced by China and India respectively. [2] [3] [4] [5] A buffer zone between them as a third group was proposed by Kristine A. Hildebrandt, followed by B. Bickel and J. Nichols. [6] The Indosphere is dominated by Indic languages . [7]
Historic Indosphere cultural influence zone of Greater India for transmission of religion, music, arts, and cuisine [8]
Some languages firmly belong to one or the other. For example, the Munda and Khasi branches of Austroasiatic languages , the Tibeto-Burman languages of Eastern Nepal , and much of the "" Kamarupan "" group of Tibeto-Burman, which most notably includes the Meitei (Manipuri), are Indospheric; while the Hmong–Mien family, the Kam–Sui branch of Kadai , the Loloish branch of Tibeto-Burman, and Vietnamese (Viet–Muong) are Sinospheric. Some other languages, like Thai and Tibetan , have been influenced by both Chinese and Indian languages at different historical periods. Still, other linguistic communities are so remote geographically that they have escaped significant influence from either. For example, the Aslian branch of Mon–Khmer in Malaya , or the Nicobarese branch of Mon–Khmer in the Nicobar Islands of the Indian Ocean shows little influence by Sinosphere or Indosphere. [1] The Bodish languages and Kham languages are characterized by hybrid prosodic properties akin to related Indospheric languages towards the west and also Sinospheric languages towards the east. [9] Some languages of the Kiranti group in the Indosphere rank among the morphologically most complex languages of Asia. [10]
Indian cultural, intellectual, and political influence – especially that of Pallava writing system – began to penetrate both insular and peninsular Southeast Asia about 2000 years ago. Indic writing systems were adopted first by Austronesians , like Javanese and Cham , and Austroasiatics , like Khmer and Mon , then by Tai ( Siamese and Lao ) and Tibeto-Burmans ( Pyu , Burmese , and Karen ). Indospheric languages are also found in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), defined as the region encompassing Laos , Cambodia , and Thailand , as well as parts of Burma , Peninsular Malaysia and Vietnam . Related scripts are also found in South East Asian islands ranging from Sumatra , Java , Bali , south Sulawesi and most of the Philippines . [11] The learned components of the vocabularies of Khmer, Mon, Burmese and Thai/Lao consist of words of Pali or Sanskrit origin. Indian influence also spread north to the Himalayan region. Tibetan has used Ranjana writing since 600 AD, but has preferred to calque new religious and technical vocabulary from native morphemes rather than borrowing Indian ones. [1] The Cham empires, known collectively as Champa , which were founded around the end of 2nd century AD, belonged directly to the influence of Greater India , rather than to the Sinosphere which shaped so much of Vietnamese culture and by which Chams were influenced later and indirectly.

List of state and union territory capitals in India
24 languages
e
India is a federal constitutional republic governed under a parliamentary system consisting of 28 states and 8 union territories . [1] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir , Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi , have elected legislatures and governments, both patterned on the Westminster model . The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act , states were reorganised on a linguistic basis. [2] Their structure has since remained largely unchanged. Each state or union territory is further divided into administrative districts.
The legislatures of three states Himachal Pradesh , Maharashtra and Uttarakhand meet in different capitals for their summer and winter sessions. Ladakh has both Leh and Kargil as its administrative capitals.
List
The state and union territory capitals are sorted according to administrative, legislative and judicial capitals. The administrative capital is where the executive government offices are located. The legislative capital is where the legislative assembly is located and the judicial capital is where the states or union territories' high courts are located.

The states of India are self-governing administrative divisions, each having a state government . The governing powers of the states are shared between the state government and the union government . On the other hand, the union territories are directly governed by the union government. [a]
History
[ edit ]
The administrative divisions of the Indian Empire in 1909
The Indian Empire was a very complex political entity consisting of various imperial divisions and states and territories of varying autonomy. At the time of its establishment in 1876, it was made up of 584 constituent states and the directly ruled territories of the Crown . The entire empire was divided into provinces and agencies.
A province consisted of territory under the direct rule of the Emperor of India (who was also the King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions ) and a few minor states, ruled by Indian princes under the suzerainty of the Emperor. A Governor or Lieutenant-Governor acted as the representative of the Emperor to that province and head of government of the directly ruled territories in the province.
The governor or lieutenant-governor also served as the Emperor's representative to the constituent states of the province. The first three of the lieutenant-governorships were territories annexed to India from other powers and temporarily governed by the erstwhile Bengal Presidency, before being made into their own separate provinces. Agra and Bengal were still considered de jure parts of the defunct Bengal Presidency for judicial and legal purposes. Agra was separated in 1878 and merged with Oudh .
The Bengal Presidency was re-established in 1912 as a governorship. All these provinces had their own legislatures established by the Indian Councils Acts, and high courts established by Indian High Courts Acts. Laws passed by these legislatures needed the dual assent of the governor or lieutenant-governor of the province and the governor-general of India , who functioned as the representative of the Emperor .
There were three governor's provinces in 1912, styled ""Presidencies"" as a historical memento that they had been once governed by presidents. These were:
United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (1902–1935)
In addition to these, there were certain territories ruled directly by the Government of India through nominated chief commissioners. These were former independent states annexed to India and since ruled directly by the Supreme Government.
There were the three chief commissioner's provinces. These did not have a legislature or a high court. These were:
Oudh (till 1878)
Delhi (from 1911, capital of India)
A vast majority of the Indian states in the late nineteenth century were, in terms of imperial divisions, organised within the provinces. However a good number of states were organised into imperial structures called agencies, or residencies. An Agent to the Governor-General (AGG) functioned as the Emperor's representative to all the states in the agency.
At the time of establishment of the empire, there were only two agencies:
[ edit ]
In 1919, the fourth Government of India was enacted by the Crown. This saw many major changes. The legislatures of the provinces were made elected ones rather than nominated ones. Some provinces were given bicameral legislatures . All provinces were elevated to governorships and all lieutenant governors were made governors. Burma was given a special status and made an autonomous province.
There were ten governor's provinces now. These were:
Delhi
The Chamber of Princes was established by Emperor George V in 1920. One of the major consequences of this was the creation of many more agencies from the states of the provinces, thus granting them direct relations with the Emperor instead of with the Governors.
There were now 8 imperial agencies and residencies. These were:
Punjab States (formerly part of Punjab Province)
Madras States (formerly part of Madras Presidency)
This saw the separation of all the states from the provinces and addition to before-mentioned agencies. This left all the provinces with only territories under direct Crown rule.
Some states were with direct relations with the Emperor. These were:
[ edit ]
The latter years of the Indian Empire saw the enactment of the last Government of India Act by the Crown. This act granted full autonomy to Indian provinces. Provincial laws no longer needed the assent of the governor-general. This act created the office of a Premier in each province, who functioned as the new head of government and was responsible to the provincial legislature.
Bengal, Madras and Bombay which had been till now styled Presidencies, were now officially styled as provinces. The provinces of Orissa and Sind were created from Bihar and Bombay respectively. The Province of Burma which had previously functioned as an autonomous province of India was now separated from the Indian Empire, and established as the Crown Colony of Burma .
The new set of 12 governor's provinces were:
Central India
Three kingdoms were in direct relations with the Emperor.
In 1947, the last Act of the Crown was passed. The act dissolved the Indian Empire, the Imperial Legislative Council and the Chamber of Princes . The Union of India was consequently established from 9 former Indian provinces ( East Punjab , United Provinces , Central Provinces , Madras , Bombay , Bihar , Orissa , West Bengal and Assam ) and 562 former Indian states.
1947–1950
Between 1947 and 1950, the territories of the princely states were politically integrated into the new Indian Union . Most were merged into existing provinces. Others were organised into new provinces and states , such as Rajasthan , Himachal Pradesh , Malwa Union , Baghelkhand and Bundelkhand States Union , and Patiala and East Punjab States Union , made up of multiple princely states. A few, including Mysore , Hyderabad , Bhopal , and Bilaspur , became separate states. [3]
The new Constitution of India , which came into force on 26 January 1950, made India a sovereign democratic republic. The new republic was also declared to be a ""Union of States"". The constitution of 1950 distinguished between three main types of states: [3]
Part A states, which were the former governors' provinces of India, were ruled by an elected governor and state legislature. The nine Part A states were:
West Bengal (formerly Bengal Province ).
The eight Part B states were former princely states or groups of princely states, governed by a rajpramukh , who was usually the ruler of a constituent state, and an elected legislature. The rajpramukh was appointed by the President of India . The Part B states were:
The only Part D state was the Andaman and Nicobar Islands , which were administered by a lieutenant governor appointed by the union government.
States reorganisation (1951–1956)
Andhra State was created on 1 October 1953 from the Telugu -speaking northern districts of Madras State . [4]
The French enclave of Chandernagore was transferred to West Bengal in 1954. In the same year Pondicherry , comprising the former French enclaves of Pondichéry , Karikal , Yanaon and Mahé , was transferred to India. This became a union territory in 1962. [5]
Also in 1954, pro-India forces liberated the Portuguese-held enclaves of Dadrá and Nagar Aveli , declaring the short-lived de facto state of Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli . In 1961, India annexed it as the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli . [6] [7] [8] [9]
The States Reorganisation Act, 1956 reorganised the states based on linguistic lines resulting in the creation of the new states. [3]
As a result of this act:
Mysore State was re-organised with the addition of the districts of Bellary and South Canara (excluding Kasaragod taluk ) and the Kollegal taluk of Coimbatore district from the Madras State, the districts of Belgaum , Bijapur , North Canara and Dharwad from Bombay State , the Kannada -majority districts of Bidar , Raichur and Kalaburagi from Hyderabad State and the Coorg State .
The Laccadive Islands , Aminidivi Islands and Minicoy Island , which had been divided between the South Canara and Malabar districts of Madras State, were united and organised into the union territory of Lakshadweep .
Rajasthan and Punjab gained territories from Ajmer State and Patiala and East Punjab States Union respectively and certain territories of Bihar were transferred to West Bengal .

Main articles: Mahagujarat movement , Punjabi Suba movement , Annexation of Goa , 1967 Goa status referendum , 1975 Sikkimese monarchy referendum , Uttarakhand movement , and Telangana movement
Bombay State was split into the linguistic states of Gujarat and Maharashtra on 1 May 1960 by the Bombay Reorganisation Act. [10] The former Union Territory of Nagaland achieved statehood on 1 December 1963. [11] The Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 resulted in the creation of Haryana on 1 November and the transfer of the northern districts of Punjab to Himachal Pradesh . [12] The act designated Chandigarh as a union territory and the shared capital of Punjab and Haryana. [13]
Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu in 1969. The north-eastern states of Manipur , Meghalaya and Tripura were formed on 21 January 1972. [14] Mysore State was renamed Karnataka in 1973. On 16 May 1975, Sikkim became the 22nd state of the Indian Union and the state's monarchy was abolished. [15] In 1987, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram became states on 20 February, followed by Goa on 30 May, while erstwhile union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu 's northern exclaves Damão and Diu became a separate union territory as Daman and Diu . [16]
In November 2000, three new states were created, namely:
Chhattisgarh , from eastern Madhya Pradesh ,
Uttaranchal, from northwest Uttar Pradesh (renamed Uttarakhand in 2007), and
Jharkhand , from southern districts of Bihar with the enforcement of Madhya Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000 , Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000 and Bihar Reorganisation Act, 2000 respectively. [17] [18] [19] [20]
Pondicherry was renamed Puducherry in 2007 and Orissa was renamed Odisha in 2011. Telangana was created on 2 June 2014 from ten former districts of north-western Andhra Pradesh . [21] [22]
In August 2019, the Parliament of India passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 , which contains provisions to reorganise the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories; Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh , effective from 31 October 2019. [23] Later that year in November, the Government of India introduced legislation to merge the union territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli into a single union territory to be known as Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu , effective from 26 January 2020.

Over 3,000 dolmens and other structures can be found in the North-Western Caucasus region in Russia, where more and more dolmens are discovered in the mountains each year. These dolmens are related to the Maykop culture . This great city of dolmens was built along the shores of the Black Sea from Maykop down to Sochi. The inhabitants were metal workers. The dolmens were vaults or safes of stone, with a narrow circular entrance that could be tapped with a round screw of stone. Supposedly the dolmens were used to hide and protect metal objects: gold, silver, bronze, jewels and some other treasure. Trade of these objects was done with Persia, Assyria, Egypt and Crete. The Dolmen City was pillaged and sacked by Scythian invaders in the early first millennium BCE. The metal workers were enslaved.[ citation needed ]
China
A large group of dolmens along the Huifa River in Jilin Province were listed as a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level in 2006. The dolmens have been dated to the fifth century BCE and total more than 80. They are linked to similar monuments found on the Korean Peninsula and the Liao River basin. [3]

Pandavara Betta (Pandavar Gudda hill) has more than 50 dolmens. Pandavara Betta is at a distance of 35 km from Sakleshpur . Lord Shiva's Betta Byraveshwara Temple is located atop Pandavar Gudda Hill. Dolmen site on the Pandavar Gudda Hill is 7 km (4.3 mi) from Somwarpet towards Shaniwar Sante in Madikeri ( Coorg ) district.
Hire Benakal or Hirebennnukullu (ಹಿರೇಬೆಣಕಲ್ಲು in Kannada) is a megalithic site in Koppal district, some 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) west of the town of Gangavati. Dated to the 800 BCE to 200 BCE period, it contains roughly 400 megalithic funerary monuments, that have been dated to the transition period between the Neolithic period and the Iron Age. Known locally (in the Kannada language) as Elllu Guddugulllu (or 'the seven hills'), their specific name is Moryar Guḍḍa (or 'The hill of the Moryas""). Hirebenakal is reported to be the largest necropolis among the 2,000 odd megalithic sites found in South India, most of them in the state of Karnataka.
Konnur (Tapaswi Maradi) has more than 3 dolmens. Tapaswi Maradi is at a distance of 5 km from Gokak Falls .
Telangana : Following dolmen graves were identified:
Dharmasagar in Hanamkonda district, one dolmen is located in the Dharmasar Hillock near Dharmasagar reservoir.
Eturnagaram in Mulugu district , dolmen are located in the forest in Eturnagaram Wildlife Sanctuary .
Tadvai in Bhupalpally district, the archaeology department found the megalithic dolmens at the forest near Tadwai.
Thatikonda in Jangaon district , dolmen were found by the historical researcher Ratnakar Reddy.
Korea
[ edit ]
Example of a southern-style dolmen at Ganghwa Island
Korean dolmens exhibit a morphology distinct from the Atlantic European dolmen. [5] [6] [7] The largest concentration of dolmens in the world is found on the Korean Peninsula . With an estimated 35,000 dolmens, Korea alone accounts for nearly 40% of the world’s total. [1] [2] The largest distribution of these is on the west coast area of South Korea , an area that would eventually become host to the Mahan confederacy and be united under the rule of the ancient kingdom of Baekje at one time.
Example of a northern-style dolmen at Ganghwa Island
34°58′39″N 126°55′54″E﻿ / ﻿34.9775414°N 126.931551°E﻿ / 34.9775414; 126.931551 ) by themselves account for over 1,000 dolmens. [8]
The Korean word for dolmen is goindol ( Korean : 고인돌) ""supported stone"". [6] Serious studies of the Korean megalithic monuments were not undertaken until relatively recently, well after much research had already been conducted on dolmens in other regions of the world. Since 1945, new research has been conducted by Korean scholars. In 1981 a curator of National Museum of Korea , Gon'gil Ji, classified Korean dolmens into two general types: northern and southern. [6]
The boundary between them falls at the Bukhan River although examples of both types are found on either side. Northern style dolmens stand above ground with a four sided chamber and a megalithic roof (also referred to as ""table type""), while southern style dolmens are normally built into the ground and contain a stone chest or pit covered by a rock slab. [5] [7]
Korean dolmens can also be divided into three main types: the table type, the go-table type and the unsupported capstone type. [5] The dolmen in Ganghwa is a northern-type, table-shaped dolmen and is the biggest stone of this kind in South Korea, measuring 2.6 by 7.1 by 5.5 m (8.5 by 23.3 by 18.0 ft). [6] There are many sub-types and different styles. [9] Southern type dolmens are associated with burials but the reason for building northern style dolmens is uncertain. [5]
Due to the vast numbers and great variation in styles, no absolute chronology of Korean dolmens has yet been established. It is generally accepted that the Korean megalithic culture emerged from the late Neolithic age, during which agriculture developed on the peninsula, and flourished throughout the Bronze Age . [10] Some dolmens depict astronomical formations, dated up to 3000 BCE, effectively the first star-chart in the world. [11] How and why Korea has produced so many dolmens is still poorly understood. There is no current conclusive theory on the origin of Korea's megalithic culture, and so it is difficult to determine the true cultural character of Korean dolmens. Some dolmens are also found in Manchuria and the Shandong Peninsula . Off the peninsula, similar specimens can be found in smaller numbers, but they are often considerably larger than the Korean dolmens. [12] It is a mystery why this culture flourished so extensively only on the Korean peninsula and its vicinity in Northeast Asia . [5]

Flint dolmen in Johfiyeh , Jordan
Dolmens can be found in the Levant , some along the Jordan Rift Valley ( Upper Galilee in Israel , the Golan Heights , [13] Jordan , Lebanon , Syria , and southeast Turkey . [14] [15]
Dolmens in the Levant are a different, unrelated tradition to that of Europe, although they are often treated ""as part of a trans-regional phenomenon that spanned the Taurus Mountains to the Arabian Peninsula ."" [14] In the Levant, they are of Early Bronze rather than Late Neolithical age. [14] They are mostly found along the Jordan Rift Valley's eastern escarpment, and in the hills of the Galilee, im clusters near Early Bronze I proto-urban settlements (3700–3000 BCE), additionally restricted by geology to areas allowing the quarrying of slabs of megalithic size. [14] In the Levant, geological constraints led to a local burial tradition with a variety of tomb forms, dolmens being one of them. [14]
Numerous large dolmens are in the Israeli national park at Gamla in the Golan Heights. [16] [17] In northern Jordan , there are many examples of flint dolmens in the historical villages of Johfiyeh and Natifah . The greatest number of dolmens in Jordan are around Madaba , like the ones at Al-Faiha village, 10 km (6.2 mi) to the west of Madaba city. [18] Two dolmens are in Hisban , and the most have been found in Wadi Zarqa Ma'in at Murayghat , which are being destroyed by gravel quarries. [19]
In Iran some dolmens can be seen in Meshgin Shahr County at Shahr Yeri or Pirazmian .[ citation needed ]

Nagarkurnool district - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarkurnool_district,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
District of Telangana in India
Nagarkurnool district
6,924 km2 (2,673 sq mi)
Population
nagarkurnool.telangana.gov.in
Nagarkurnool district is a district in the southern region of the Indian state of Telangana . [2] [3] The town of Nagarkurnool is the district headquarters. It was part of the Mahbubnagar district prior to re-organisation of districts in the state. The district shares boundaries with Nalgonda , Rangareddy , Mahabubnagar , Wanaparthy districts and with the state boundary of Andhra Pradesh with Nandyal , Palnadu and Prakasam Districts .
History
[ edit ]
The Nagarkurnool district is historically, traditionally ruled by several empires in past.

Medical tourism in India
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Medical tourism in India refers to the patients traveling to India for treatment, surgery
Max Healthcare in Gurgaon
Medical tourism in India is a growing sector within the country's economy. In 2022, India's medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$9 billion. [1] Approximately 2 million patients visit India each year from 78 countries for medical, wellness and IVF treatments, generating $6 billion for the industry which is expected to reach $13 billion by 2026 and is backed by the Indian government 's Heal in India initiative. [2] According to a report from 2019 by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and Ernst & Young , most of the medical patients arrivals in India were from Southeast Asia, Middle East, Africa, and SAARC region. [3] India also receives significant number of medical patients from Australia, Canada, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [4] The city of Chennai has come to be known as the healthcare capital of India.
To encourage applications and ease the travel process for medical tourists, the India government has expanded its e-tourism visa regime in February 2019. The maximum duration of stay under this visa is 6 months. [5] Since 30 August 2019, foreigners can receive any medical treatment in India with the exception of organ transplants without a medical visa. [3]
In Aug 2023, the Government of India's Ministry of Home Affairs has announced the creation of the Ayush Visa category for foreign nationals at promoting travel healthcare in India and also and also tech-savvy companies are now stepping in to address this gap, offering online medical tourism in India. [6]
Attractions
[ edit ]
Advantages of medical treatment in India include reduced costs, the availability of latest medical technologies, [7] and compliance on international quality standards, doctors trained in western countries including the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as English-speaking personnel, due to which foreigners are less likely to face language barriers in India.
Advantages
Hinduja National Hospital, Mumbai
Most estimates found that treatment costs in India start at around one-tenth of the price of comparable treatment in the United States or the United Kingdom. [8] [9] The most popular treatments sought in India by medical tourists are alternative medicine , bone-marrow transplant , cardiac bypass , eye surgery , and joint replacement .
Quality of care
[ edit ]
India has 839 NABH accredited hospitals.However, for a patient traveling to India, it is important to find the optimal doctor-hospital combination. After the patient has been treated, the patient has the option of either recuperating in the hospital or at a paid accommodation nearby. Many hospitals also give the option of continuing the treatment through telemedicine .
The city of Chennai has been termed "" India's health capital "". [10] [11] [12] [13] Multi- and super-specialty hospitals across the city bring in an estimated 150 international patients every day. [10] Chennai attracts about 45 percent of health tourists from abroad arriving in the country and 30 to 40 percent of domestic health tourists. [11] Factors behind the tourists inflow in the city include low costs, little to no waiting period, [14] and facilities offered at the specialty hospitals in the city. [10] The city has an estimated 12,500 hospital beds, of which only half is used by the city's population with the rest being shared by patients from other states of the country and foreigners. [15] Dental clinics have attracted dental care tourism to Chennai. [16]
Private institutions and organizations such as Max Healthcare have consulted and treated up to 50,000 foreign patients in hospitals across the country.
The promotion of medical tourism in India has helped private players capitalize on this market opportunity. [17]
According to Pankaj Chandna, Co-founder of Vaidam Health [18]
As an industry grows bigger, it catches the attention of smart and tech-savvy entrepreneurs about how they can catch up with someone who has been running the business through traditional means for 7-10 years. That’s exactly what is happening in medical travel now.
According to Darpan Jain, Joint Secretary of the Indian government's Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce & Industry:
The strength of India lies in the skills of our doctors, support staff, calibre of our nurses and the state–of–the art infrastructure which has come up in the last few years, some of which are still not available even in very developed economies. [3]
Bengaluru , Chandigarh Capital Region (CCR), Delhi NCR including Gurugram [19] and Faridabad , Jaipur , Kerala , Kolkata , and Mumbai are other Medical tourism hubs in India. Hisar Medicity is an upcoming hub, which was under planning and construction in 2021. [20]
Ease of travel
[ edit ]
The government has removed visa restrictions on tourist visas that required a two-month gap between consecutive visits for people from Gulf countries which is likely to boost medical tourism. [21] A visa-on-arrival scheme for tourists from select countries has been instituted which allows foreign nationals to stay in India for 30 days for medical reasons. [22] In 2016, citizens of Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Maldives, Republic of Korea and Nigeria availed the most medical visas. [23]
Language
[ edit ]
Despite India's diversity of languages, English is an official language and is widely spoken by most people and almost universally by medical professionals. In Noida , a number of hospitals have hired language translators to make patients from Balkan and African countries feel more comfortable while at the same time helping in the facilitation of their treatment. [24]
A large number of medical tourism companies are facilitating foreigners, especially patients from Arabic, Russian and English-speaking countries.[ citation needed ]
Medical statistics
[ edit ]
In November 2019, a report from The Economic Times stated that of all medical tourist arrivals in India, Maharashtra receives 27%, Chennai receives around 15%, and Kerala receives nearly 5–7% of them. [3]
According to Huffington Post , doctors spoke about the problems with ""corporate hospitals"" and senior surgeons being told to sell surgeries to their patients even if they weren't needed. In one instance, a doctor was told he would be sacked if he didn't have enough patients to operate on. [25] The majority of India's private , for-profit hospitals charge exorbitant costs for medical services and supplies, which has put a strain on the country's public finances. [25] [26] [27] [28]
Russia Beyond notes that of the estimated 300,000 Russian medical tourists who travel worldwide every year for healthcare, India receives over 70,000 of them. [4]

Foreign tourists, mostly from Europe, arrive in Goa in winter, whilst the summer and monsoon seasons see many Indian tourists. Goa handled 2.29% of all foreign tourist arrivals in the country in 2011. [1] [2] This relatively small state is situated on the west coast of India, between the borders of Maharashtra and Karnataka , and is better known to the world as a former Portuguese enclave on Indian soil. Thus, Tourism forms the backbone of Goa's economy. [3]
Major tourist attractions include Bom Jesus Basilica , Fort Aguada , a wax museum on Indian culture, and a heritage museum. The Churches and Convents of Goa have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO .
As of 2013, Goa was the destination of choice for Indian and foreign tourists, particularly Britons, with limited means who wanted to party . The state was hopeful that changes could be made which would attract a more upscale demographic. [4]
On 24 November 2017, Delta Corp Limited claimed to have set up the first casino game training course centre in India at Goa.
Goa also draws tourists from all over India for its bungee activity, [5] water sports [6] and underwater scuba diving experience. [7]

Rudrama Devi
(Redirected from Rudramadevi )
Queen regnant of the Kakatiya Kingdom from 1262 to 1289
For the 2015 film, see Rudhramadevi (film) . For the 2021 television series, see Rudramadevi (TV series) .

Reign
November 1289 CEPossibly at Chandupatla (present-day Telangana , India)
Spouse
Ganapati-deva
Rudrama Devi (r. c. 1262 - 1289; also known by her regnal name Rudra-deva Maharaja) was a Kakatiya Queen regnant who ruled substantial parts of present-day Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in southern India . She was among the few successful female rulers in Indian history .
Rudrama's father and predecessor Ganapati , who had no son, appointed her as his co-regent around 1260. By 1263, Rudrama became the sole ruler, although she was not formally anointed as a sovereign at least until 1269. Early during her reign, Rudrama appears to have faced a revolt, which she was able to suppress with the support of her loyalists. She recovered some of the territories that the Kakatiyas had lost during the late 1250s and the early 1260s to their southern neighbours - the Pandyas . She also repulsed invasions by the Seunas (Yadavas) from the north-west, and the Gajapatis from the north-east. In the 1270s and the 1280s, Rudrama lost much of her southern territory to a revolt by the Kayastha chief Amba-deva , and likely lost her life in a conflict against him in 1289. Her grandson Prataparudra succeeded her on the Kakatiya throne.
The reign of Rudrama was remarkable for the rise of several non-aristocratic warriors in the Kakatiya service. She strengthened the Warangal Fort by raising its inner wall and constructing an outer wall surrounded by a moat.
Early life
[ edit ]
Rudrama- devi , also known as Rudramba, was a daughter of her predecessor King Ganapati-deva. Kumara-svami Somapithi, in his commentary on Vidyanatha's Prataparudra-yashobhushanam, states that Rudrama was a daughter of Ganapati by queen Somamba. However, at another place in the same text, he incorrectly names Rudrama as the chief queen of Ganapati. Some other sources also incorrectly describe Rudrama as a wife of Ganapati, including the Venetian traveler Marco Polo (who visited the Kakatiya kingdom around 1293 CE), and the 17th-century text Pratapa-charitra. However, contemporary epigraphic evidence makes it clear that Rudrama was a daughter of Ganapati, not his wife. [2]
Rudrama married Vira-bhadra, a son of Indu-shekhara, the Chalukya samanta of Nidadavolu . [3] There are several instances of Kakatiya monarchs reinstating defeated families to power and establishing marital relations with them: it is possible that Ganapati had subjugated this Chalukya branch during his conquest of Vengi in 1240. He probably arranged Rudrama's marriage shortly after, [4] in order to secure the political allegiance of the Chalukyas of Nidadavolu. [5]
Ascension
[ edit ]
Ganapati apparently retired after suffering defeats at his southern frontier, against the Pandyas , in the late 1250s. [6] He had no male heir, [7] and nominated Rudrama as his successor. She began to rule as a co-regent from c. 1260 under the regnal name Rudra-deva Maharaja . [6] Ganapati probably became too old and weak to govern, and assigned Rudrama to run the government. [8] She appears to have become the sole ruler in 1263. [9]
The 1266 CE Tripuranthakam inscription of the Kakatiya maha-pradhana Pedda Mallaya Preggada mentions Maharaja Ganapati-deva as the ruling sovereign, not Rudrama. The 1269 CE Duggi inscription of the Kakatiya subordinate Janniga-deva describes Rudrama as pattoddhati (a mistake for pattoddhrti, meaning ""chose royalty""). This suggests that in 1269, Ganapati was alive and Rudrama had not formally been anointed as a sovereign: officially, she was still a queen designate. [10]
Epigraphic evidence suggests that in the 1260s, the Kakatiyas lost control of several territories that were part of Ganapati's kingdom at its greatest extent. The southernmost territories were lost to the Pandyas, parts of coastal Andhra in the east were lost to the Gajapatis , and parts of Telangana in the north-west were lost to the Seunas (Yadavas). [11] In the Vengi region, no Kakatiya records have been found for the period 1262–1278, which suggests that their former vassals - the Kona Haihaya and the Chalukya chiefs - no longer acknowledged the Kakatiya suzerainty. [12] It is possible that the Kakatiya monarch granted autonomy to the Chalukyas of Nidadavolu, because Vira-bhadra of this family was Rudrama's husband; however, this is not certain. [13]
Revolts
[ edit ]
It appears that some nobles and Rudrama's own relatives did not approve of a woman being nominated to the throne. The 17th-century text Pratapa-charitra states that two men named Hari-hara and Murari-deva revolted against Rudrama. The text describes them as Ganapati's sons from his junior queens. [6] It states that they captured the Kakatiya capital Warangal, and ousted Rudrama from there. Rudrama then rallied her supporters, recaptured the fort, and had her half-brothers killed. This account is not supported by any other evidence, and no other source mentions these purported sons of Ganapati, or Ganapati having any sons. [10] According to the Tripurantakam inscription of Ganapati's sister Mailama, Hari-hara was actually a paternal uncle of Ganapati. [6] Though the historicity of the Pratapa-charitra account is doubtful, it probably preserves the memory of a rebellion against Rudrama. [14]
Pratapa-charitra states that Prasaditya assumed the titles Kakatiya-rajya-sthapan-acharya (Sanskrit for ""a pillar of support for the Kakatiya kingdom"" [15] ) and Raya-pitamahanka, highlighting his role in the re-establishment of the Kakatiya power.  It is Prasaditya's family chronicle, so it exaggerates his role in suppressing the rebellion against Rudrama. Several other chiefs assumed similar titles, which suggests that they may have also helped Rudrama suppress the rebellion. [14] For example:
The following Kakatiya subordinates assumed the title Raya-sthapan-acharya in their inscriptions dating from 1275 to 1290 CE: [14] [16] [6]
Maha-pradhana Kannara-nayaka (or Kandara-nayaka)
Maha-pradhana Ganapati-deva (or Ganapad-deva) Maharajulu
Nisshanka Mallikarjuna Nayaka
The Malayala chief Gundaya-nayaka and Madaya-nayaka assumed the epithets (biruda) svami-drohara-ganda [14]
Machaya Nayaka bore the epithet svami-drohara-ganda and svami-vamchakara-ganda [14]
Some early 14th-century chiefs, such as Devari Nayadu (fl. 1313–1317) and Kachaya Reddi, also bear similar titles, but they likely did not fight for Rudrama; they probably assumed these titles after fighting against the invasions from the Delhi Sultanate . [14]
Reign
[ edit ]
Epigraphic evidence suggests that during much of the 1260s and 1270s, the Gajapatis from the north-east maintained a presence in the coastal Andhra region, which was a part of Ganapati's kingdom at its greatest extent. For example, a 1262 CE Draksharamam inscription mentions Nara-simha-naradhipa (""Narasimha, the lord of men""), who was most probably the Gajapati king Narasimha I . Bhanudeva I, the son of Narasimha, invaded Vengi around 1274 CE, as attested by his two inscriptions at Draksharamam. [11] Arjuna-deva, the Matsya chief of Oddadi, as well as other chiefs, accompanied him. [13]
Rudrama sent an army led by the brothers Poti Nayaka and Proli Nayaka against the Gajapati forces. The two brothers assumed the titles Gajapati-matta-matanga-simha (""lion to the rutting elephant"") and Oddiyaraya-manamardana (""the destroyer of the pride of the Odia king""). This suggest that they repulsed the Gajapati invasion. [13] Their army appears to have re-established the Kakatiya authority in much of the coastal Andhra region, with the Gajapati power restricted to the north of the Godavari River . [11]
The Kakatiya rule in the region is attested by a 1278-1279 CE inscription of Karaparti Suraya Reddi, who describes himself as a servant of Kakatiya Rudradeva Maharaja, that is, Rudrama. His inscription records a gift to the temple of the god Bhimeshvara at Draksharamam. [13] Epigraphic evidence suggests that the Kakatiya control of the coastal Andhra region remained unchallenged during the rest of Rudrama's reign. [14]
Conflicts with the Pandyas and their vassals
[ edit ]
Towards the end of the Ganapati's reign the Pandyas had conquered the southernmost part of the Kakatiya territory, including Nellore , and their vassals ruled this area in the subsequent years. [17] The 1264 CE and 1269 CE inscriptions of Rudrama's Kayastha subordinate Janniga-deva claim that he ruled the area extending from Panugal in the north to Kaivaram-kota in the south; [17] Ganapati had conferred this area as a fief upon him. [18] However, epigraphic evidence suggests that much of this area was controlled by Pandya allies: the Kalukada chiefs Keshava-deva and his brother Raya-murari Soma-deva. [19]
An undated Chidambaram inscription of the Pandya prince Vikrama states that he did not march further north because he did not want to fight a woman who had assumed the name of a king. According to historians N. Venkataramanayya and M. Somasekhara Sarma, this may be euphemistic cover for his failed expedition against Rudrama. [17]
Inscriptions of Rudrama and her subordinates, discovered in the Kadapa and Nellore areas, suggest that Kakatiyas regained control over some of the territory that they had earlier lost to the Pandyas: [20]
The 1264 CE Nandalur inscription of Nagaraja, the pradhani of Rudrama's subordinate Janniga-deva, records a gift to the temple of Samuya-natha-svami. [20]
The 1268 CE Atluru inscription near Siddavatam also attests to Janniga-deva's control over the area. Although the inscription is damaged, and the name of the issuer is lost, his titles and date indicate that he was Janniga-deva. [20]
Epigraphic evidence suggests that the Kakatiyas also ousted the Pandya vassal Vira Rajendra Chola (likely Rajendra Chola III [17] ) from Nellore. Mahamandaleshvara Naga-deva Maharaja, a vassal of Rudrama, ruled at Nellore during 1271–1275. [20]
The Kakatiya subordinates soon lost these territories to rival chiefs, who were probably Pandya vassals. The Telugu Choda chief Vijaya Ganda-gopala appears to have displaced the Kayasthas. Tiru-kalatti-deva II (alias Tribhuvana-chakravarti Irumadi), the eldest son of the former Choda ruler Manuma-siddhi II, appears to have displaced Naga-deva from Nellore in 1263. He apparently ruled Nellore during c. 1279–1283, before another Choda chief Manuma-Gandagopala displaced him. [21]
Conflict with the Seunas
[ edit ]
The Seuna (Yadava) king Mahadeva invaded the Kakatiya kingdom during Rudrama's reign. The Seuna records, including Mahadeva's inscriptions and Hemadri 's Vrata-khanda, suggest that he achieved military successes against the ruler of Tilinga (Telangana), that is, the Kakatiya monarch. For example, they claim that Mahadeva was ""the uprooter of the stalk of the lotus of the head"" of the ruler of Tilinga, that he blew away this ruler like a strong wind blows away cotton, and that he ""captured in battle the elephants and the five musical instruments"" of this ruler. [22] The Vrata-khanda claims that Mahadeva left Rudrama free because he was reluctant to kill a woman. [23] The epithet ""the uprooter of the stalk of the lotus of the head"" appears to be a hereditary title inherited from his great-grandfather Jaitugi , who is known to have killed a Kakatiya king. Other claims made in the Seuna inscriptions are clear exaggerations. [22]
The records from Telangana suggest that Rudrama not only repulsed the Seuna invasion, but also annexed a part of their territory. The 17th-century text Pratapa-charitra describes the episode as follows: Mahadeva besieged the Kakatiya capital Warangal for 15 days, but Rudrama led the Kakatiya forces to destroy his 300,000 infantry and 100,000 cavalry. Rudrama then chased Mahadeva to the Seuna capital Devagiri ; there, Mahadeva sued for peace, agreed to pay her 10 million gold coins as war indemnity , and concluded a peace treaty. Rudrama distributed the money among her commanders, set up a victory pillar in the Seuna territory, and returned to her own kingdom. [24]
The Pratapa-charitra claims, such as Rudrama's purported destruction of the 300,000 infantry and 100,000 cavalry, are obvious exaggerations. However, epigraphic and numismatic evidence suggests that Rudrama indeed repulsed a Seuna invasion: [25]
A fragmentary Bidar Fort inscription mentions Rudrama's subordinate Bhairava of Sinda family, and states that he accompanied Rudrama as a commander of her army in all her expeditions. Bidar is located in the southern part of the traditional Seuna territory, and this inscription may have been issued during Rudrama's offensive against the Seunas, in the Bedadakota (present-day Bidar) area. [26] The inscription mentions her title as Raya-gaja-kesari, which she inherited from her father. [27]
A 1267 CE Panugal inscription of the Seuna prince Sharnga-pani-deva records a gift to the temple of Chhaya-Somanatha. The inscription describes him as a son of the Seuna king Simhana and a subordinate of the Kakatiya Manuma-Rudradeva, that is, Rudrama. According to historian M. Somasekhara Sarma , this Sharnga-pani-deva is same as the Sharnga-pani-deva described in the 1268 CE Hire-Kogilur inscription as the father of Mahadeva. He theorizes that Mahadeva's father Sharnga-pani-deva seized Panagal during the Seuna invasion of the Kakatiya territory, and acknowledged her suzerainty after the Seuna defeat. [25] However, historian P.V.P. Sastry theorizes that Sharnga-pani-deva (or Sarjnapani-deva) of the Panugal inscription was another Seuna prince who sought asylum with the Kakatiyas because of his differences with Mahadeva. [26]
In 1922, a set of 43 gold coins issued by Seuna kings was unearthed at Rachapatnam near Kaikaluru . M. Somasekhara Sarma notes that the treasure cannot be considered to be a proof of Seuna presence in the Kakatiya country, as coins travel extensive distances; for example, Roman coins have been found in southern India because of trade. According to him, the coins may have been part of the war indemnity that the Seunas paid to Rudrama according to the Pratapa-charitra. [28]
Amba-deva's revolt
[ edit ]
Members of the Kayastha family, who held a fief in the southern part of the Kakatiya kingdom, appear to have been loyal to Rudrama during the tenure of the brothers Janniga-dev and Tripurari-deva. [26] Their younger brother Amba-deva , who became the Kayastha chief in 1272, [21] appears to have been loyal to Rudrama for some time, as suggested by his title raya-sthapanacharya (""a pillar of support for the kingdom"" [15] ). [12] However, his inscriptions do not mention any overlord, which suggests that he soon asserted independence, giving up his allegiance to Rudrama. [29]
Amba-deva's 1290 CE Tripurantakam inscription, records his military successes, including his victories over the feudatories and allies of Rudrama. [30] [29]
In 1273, he defeated the Shripati Ganapati, the ruler of the Gurindala ( Gurazala or Gurijala) area. [31] A 1268 CE Mutukur inscription suggests that Ganapati was a vassal of Rudrama. [31]
Amba-deva claims to have cut off heads of 75 chiefs (nayakas) in battle. [30] These chiefs were probably Rudrama's subordinates, whom she sent to subjugate Amba-deva after his victory over Shripati Ganapati. [31] The number 75 and the beheading claim are likely poetic exaggeration, and may be interpreted to mean that Amba-deva simply defeated the entire Kakatiya army. [32]
Amba-deva claims to have caused his destruction or ruin (vidhvamsa) of Kopperunjinga alias Kadava-raya, [32] a Pandya vassal who was also possibly a Kakatiya ally at the time. [33]
Sometime before 1281, Amba-deva appointed Manuma Ganda-gopala on the throne of Nellore . [34] [32]
Amba-deva defeated Manu-Mallideva, the Telugu Choda ruler of the Eruva region, and annexed his territories. [30] Although Manu-Mallideva's inscriptions do not mention any overlord, he may have been a Kakatiya subordinate. [35]
Amba-deva also defeated the Pandya ruler Maravarman Kulashekhara, and his allies, the Kalukada chiefs. [36] He established a marital alliance with a chief named Bollaya, and conquered the Pendekallu area. [35] [30]
With these victories, Amba-deva carved out an independent principality that included almost all of the former south-western parts of the Kakatiya territory to the south of the Krishna River. [34] As a result, at the time of Rudrama's death, the Kakatiya kingdom was smaller than the one she had inherited; nevertheless, it was still larger than it had been during the early part of her father's reign. [37] The distribution of inscriptions that mention her as sovereign suggests that the Kakatiya sphere of influence shrank during her reign. [38]
Death
[ edit ]
The 1289 CE Chandupatla inscription that mentions the death of Rudrama
Rudrama appears to have been killed in November 1289 CE by Amba-deva's forces. This theory is supported by the following evidence: [39]
The 27 November 1289 Chandupatla inscription records warrior Puvvula Mummadi's gift of some land to the god Soma-natha-deva, for the merit of Rudrama (called ""Kakati Rudrama-devi"") and her general Mallikarjuna-nayaka. It states that both of them had attained Shiva - loka , that is, died, presumably a few days before the date of the record. [40]
A 1290 CE inscription, issued by Mallikarjuna's son Immadi Mallikarjuna-nayaka, attests that Mallikarjuna was a general of Rudrama; this inscription was issued for the merit of ""Kumara Rudra-deva Maharaja"". [40]
These inscriptions suggest that Rudrama and her general Mallikarjuna died at the same time. According to historian P.V.P. Sastry, Rudrama was likely very old at the time - around eighty years - and therefore, probably did not lead her forces in a battle. However, she may have accompanied her army - commanded by Mallikarjuna - to inspire them. [40]
Amba-deva's 1290 CE Tripurantakam inscription states he deprived Mallikarjuna-pati of seven limbs. This Mallikarjuna, whom the inscription describes as an enemy of gods and brahmanas , appears to be same as Rudrama's general Mallikarjuna. [41] In this context, the ""seven limbs"" appear to refer to the seven constituent members of Mallikarjuna's royalty, [29] defined in the Sanskrit thesaurus Amara-ksoha as ""king, minister, friend, treasury, territory, forts and forces"". [41]
Amba-deva's revolt is the only political disturbance known to have taken place in the Kakatiya kingdom around 1289 CE. Besides claiming to have deprived Mallikarjuna of his overlord (one of the ""limbs""), [42] Amba-deva also claims to have ""vanquished"" all the kings of Andhra. [35] This suggests that he was responsible for killing Rudrama: according to Sastry, he did not explicitly state that he killed Rudrama, because boasting about killing an old woman would have discredited him as a warrior. [41]
In 2017, archaeologist D. Kanna Babu of Archaeological Survey of India identified two sculptures at Pochalamma temple in Bollikunta as depictions of Rudrama. The first sculpture shows her riding a horse with reins in her left hand and a sword in her right hand; it features an overhead umbrella - the royal insignia. The second sculpture shows her tired, seated sorrowfully, and leaning towards left; the royal umbrella is missing, presumably because she lost it in the battle; and there is a buffalo - the vehicle of Yama , the lord of death. According to Babu's interpretation, the sculptures depict Rudrama's death in a battle against Amba-deva. [43]
Around 1291, during the reign of Rudrama's successor Prataparudra , the Kakatiya forces defeated Amba-deva. [44] Earlier historians believed that Rudramadevi ruled until 1295, because some records before this year name Prataparudra as Kumara (Prince) Rudra. [45] However, the discovery of the Chandupatla inscription confirmed that Rudramadevi died before 27 November 1289. [40] [46] Moreover, some records before 1295 (such as the 1292 Inkirala inscription) call Prataparudra a Maharaja (""great king""). It appears that Prataparudra continued to be called Kumara Rudra for some years after ascending the throne, because this was a familiar usage. [45]
Administration
[ edit ]
According to an early 14th-century text, Rudrama's father Ganapati considered her equal to a son, and therefore, decided to use a male persona for her. [47] Rudrama thus promoted a male image to rule in a patrilineal society that traditionally excluded women from political power: she assumed a male name and wore masculine clothing. [48] Her husband Vira-bhadra finds few mentions in historical records and did not actively participate in the administration. [37]
Rudrama recruited several non-aristocratic warriors into the Kakatiya service: her successor Prataparudra as well as the later Vijayanagara emperors adopted this policy as well. [37] Epigraphic evidence suggests that during and after the later part of Ganapati's reign, the number and proportion of officers (as opposed to chiefs and princes) among individuals acknowledging Kakatiya overlordship increased significantly. For example, out of the 34 Kakatiya subordinates known from Kakatiya inscriptions during the early part of Ganapati's reign (c. 1199-1230 CE), 47% were chiefs and princes, while 26% were officers. From Rudrama's reign, 63 subordinates are known: only 17% of these were chiefs and princes, while 38% were officers. This suggests that, during this period, the noble families declined while the importance of the officers grew. [49] In the Kakatiya administration, the officers with the designation anga-rakshaka (bodyguard) first appeared during Rudrama's rule, and virtually disappeared during the reign of her successor Prataparudra. [15]
The Malayala and Recherla chiefs, who played an important role during the reigns of the preceding kings Rudra and Ganapati, appear to have retired from active service during Rudrama's reign. New chiefs, such as Reddis of Gona family and the Velamas, emerged as the important generals during her time. [12]
Notable subordinates of Rudrama included:
The Reddi chiefs of the Gona family: Gona Gannaya and his general Vitthala helped Rudrama's successor Prataparudra conquer the Bellary and Raichur forts from the Seunas. [50]
The Velama chief Prasaditya, who commanded the south-western region of the Kakatiya kingdom. [50]
The Kayastha brothers Janniga-deva, Tripurantaka (alias Tripurari), and Amba-deva, who ruled in succession. [26] Amba-deva appears to have been loyal to Rudrama for some time, as suggested by his title raya-sthapan-acharya, before he asserted independence. [12]
The Are vassals migrated from western Deccan to the Srisailam area, which came to be known as Are-bhumi or Are-vidu. Sharnga-pani-deva, a son of the Seuna king Simhana, was the most important Are vassal of Rudrama. Ranaka Gopa-deva-raja, a military commander mentioned in the 1273 CE Gundalapadu inscription, was another chief of Are ancestry. [50]
Bhairava, son of Maila of Sinda family, was a vassal of Rudrama. According to the Bidar inscription, he assisted the queen in her successful military campaigns in Vengi, Dravila, and the Seuna kingdom. [51]
Sura, a chief (samanta) of the Viriyala family, served the queen as a military commander (senadhipati) in the northern region. [51]
The chiefs of the Cheraku family served as Rudrama's commanders in the southern region. [51]
Minister (maha-pradhana) and commander (senadhipati) Annaya-deva of Induluri family was Rudrama's son-in-law. [52]
Ponkala Mallaya Preggada, another maha-pradhana, held the office of bahattara-niyogadhipati, [51] the superintendent of 72 niyogas or royal offices. [18]
Constructions
[ edit ]
Rudrama continued the fortification of Warangal by raising the height of a curtain wall , approximately 0.75 miles (1.21 km) in diameter, to 20 feet (6.1 m). This wall was made of granite blocks, was surrounded by a wide moat, and had 45 bastions , which were 40–60 feet on a side. She also commissioned the construction of an outer earthen wall, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) in diameter, and surrounded by an additional 150 150 feet (46 m)-wide moat. [53]
Rudrama built a ranga-mandapa dedicated to her family deity Svayambhu -deva (Shiva) in the Warangal Fort . A sculpture discovered among the ruins of this structure depicts her as a lion-mounted warrior holding a dagger and a shield in her hands. The image also depicts an elephant holding a lotus in its trunk: according to historian P.V.P. Sastry, it represents Rudrama's title Raya-gaja-kesari. [54]
Family and succession
[ edit ]
Rudrama and her husband Vira-bhadra had three daughters: Mummadamma, Rudrama, and Ruyyama (alias Ruyyamba). [3] According to Vidyanatha's Prataparudra-Yashobhushana, Mummadamma married Mahadeva. [51] Rudrama, the princess who shared her mother's name, married the Seuna (Yadava) prince Yellana-deva (or Ellana-deva [3] ), who held a fief near Guntur, as suggested by his Alapadu inscription. [55] Ruyyama married the minister and commander Annaya-deva of Induluri family, who was a son of Gannaya. [52]
Since queen Rudrama had no son, her father Ganapati asked her to adopt Mummadamma's son Prataparudra alias Vira-rudra as her own son. Rudrama did so, and nominated Prataparudra as her successor. [51]
Rudrama had a sister named Ganapama-devi (or Ganapamba), who married Beta of Kota family . [7]
In popular culture
[ edit ]
Among the historical rulers of India, Rudrama was one of the few women who inherited the throne from her father. She was also among the most successful women rulers of medieval South Asia, by the length of her reign as well as by the area of her kingdom. The historical traditions written in the centuries immediately following her death did not celebrate her as an important female monarch, and instead presented her as a widow queen who ruled on behalf of her infant son. However, in the 20th century, she became a source of regional pride in the Andhra Pradesh (later split into Telangana ). [47]
In 2015, filmmaker Gunasekhar made a Telugu film Rudhramadevi on the life of Rudrama Devi with Anushka Shetty playing the titular role. [56]
Peninsula Pictures produced a serial on Star Maa titled Rudramadevi which pictured the childhood of Rudramadevi to the TV viewers for 100 episodes. [57]

Vikramaditya VI
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Western Chalukya King

Western Chalukya King

Vikramaditya VI (r. 1076 – 1126 CE) became the Western Chalukya King after deposing his elder brother Someshvara II , a political move he made by gaining the support of Chalukya vassals during the Chola invasion of Chalukya territory. [1] [2] Vikramaditya's reign is marked with the abolishment of the Saka era and the start of the Chalukya-Vikrama era. He was the greatest of the Western Chalukya kings and had the longest reign in the dynasty. He earned the title Permadideva and Tribhuvanamalla (lit ""lord of three worlds""). [3] [4] [5] He had several queens who ably assisted him in administration. One of his queens, Chandala Devi, a princess from the Shilahara ruling family of Karad was called Abhinava Saraswati for her skills as an artist. Queen Kethala Devi administered the Siruguppa region and Savala Devi was in charge of an Agrahara in Naregal . [6] According to the historian Kamath, Vikramaditya VI was a ""great king who ruled over South India"" and he finds a ""pride of place in Karnataka history"". More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to Vikramaditya VI than any other king prior to the Vijayanagara era. [4] [7]
Vikramaditya VI is noted for his patronage of art and letters. His court was adorned with famous Kannada and Sanskrit poets. [8] In Kannada, his brother prince Kirtivarma wrote Govaidya on veterinary science and the poet Brahmashiva wrote Samayaparikshe (""Analysis of the doctrine"", c. 1125) and received the title Kavi Chakravarti (lit, ""Emperor among poets"") [9] Noted Sanskrit scholars such as Bilhana who earned the title Vidyapati ("" pundit "") came to his court from faraway Kashmir and wrote a panegyric on the life of his patron king in Vikramankadevacharita. The poet compared his rule to Ramarajya ("" Rama 's Kingdom""). Vijnaneshwara the noted jurist in his court wrote Mitakshara , a commentary on Yagnavalkya Smriti (on Hindu family law). Of the king he wrote ""A King like Vikramarka is neither to be seen nor heard of"". [10] Vikramaditya VI is known to be a Shaiva by faith. [3] His rule saw prolific temple building activity. Notable constructions include the Mallikarjuna temple , [11] the Mahadeva temple [12] the Kaitabheshvara temple [13] and the Kalleshvara temple . [14] According to historian Sen, the 50-year reign of Vikramaditya VI was overall a peaceful and prosperous one. Sen estimates at his peak Vikramaditya VI controlled a vast empire stretching from the Tumkur district and Cuddapah in the south to the Narmada River in the north, and up to the Khammam district and the Godavari district in the east and south-east. [15]
Vikramaditya's rebellion, rise to power and Chola relations
Vikramaditya displayed his military ambitions even as a prince, prior to 1068, during the rule of his father Someshvara I when he led successful military campaigns as far east as modern Bihar and Bengal . [16] [17] [18] After his father's death, as soon as his elder brother prince Someshvara II who administered the Belavola-300 and Puligere-300 provinces came to the throne, Vikramaditya VI started to plan to overthrow him and contend with the growing Chola power. He achieved his ends with skillful opportunism and diplomacy: by making use of the Chola invasion of Gutti and Kampili and striking diplomatic relations with Virarajendra Chola, gaining the support his younger brother Jayasimha and of the Chalukya feudatories, the Pandyas of Ucchangi, the Seuna , the Hoysalas of Malnad, the Kadambas of Konkan and Hangal. Someshvara II had the support of the Kulothunga Chola I (also called Rajendra II of the Eastern Chalukya-Chola royal family of Vengi) and the Kadambas of Goa. This sudden change in diplomatic relations practically bifurcated the Chalukya kingdom into two halves, giving Vikramaditya VI independent rule over the southern half (Gangavadi). Vikramaditya married one of Virarajendra Chola's daughters bringing an age-old feud between the two kingdoms to a temporary end. [19] [20]
The balance of power changed again in 1069 with the death of Virarajendra Chola. Vikramaditya VI proceeded via Kanchi where he quelled a rebellion and installed his younger brother-in-law Athirajendra Chola on the throne at Gangaikonda Cholapuram . But this went against the designs of Kulottunga Chola I who had plans of his own. Kulothunga expelled the Vengi ruler Vijayaditya. In a civil uprising in the Chola capital, Athirajendra was killed making way for Kulothunga Chola I to crown himself the monarch of the Chola empire. [21] [20] In 1070-72, when Vijayabahu revolted to rid Ceylon of the Chola rule and succeeded, Vikramaditya VI wasted no time in declaring the new king of Ceylon his ""natural ally"". By 1076, despite being surrounded by enemies at home (Someshvara II) and in Vengi and Chola country (Kulothunga Chola I), Vikramaditya VI successfully defeated his elder brother and took him captive. He then crowned himself the Chalukya monarch and began a new era, the Vikrama Varsha. [22] [5] [3]
Hoysala threat
There was a rebellion by the emperor's younger brother Jayasimha, the viceroy of Banavasi, around c.1080-1082 which was quelled and the rebel pardoned. [23] The real threat, however, was from the Hoysala dynasty who rose to prominence from the Malnad region in modern Karnataka. Their territory effectively acted as a buffer between the Chalukya and Chola kingdoms. For several decades, the Hoysalas had been faithful vassals of the Chalukyas. King Someshvara I (Vikramaditya's father) had taken a Hoysala princess as his queen. The Hoysala kings Vinayaditya , Ereyanga and Veera Ballala I had maintained cordial relations with Vikramaditya VI. But Ballala I's younger brother Vishnuvardhana , who according to historians Sastri and Kamath was a ""great warrior"" and an ambitious ruler had expansionist plans. He had the support of the Pandya ruler of Ucchangi and Kadamba king Jayakesi II of Goa. The Hoysalas under Vishnuvardhana began to expand their territory initially by defeating the Cholas in the famous battle of Talakad in 1116 resulting in the Hoysala annexation of Gangavadi (part of modern Southern Karnataka). [24] [4] [25] [5] It was only when Vishnuvardhana turned his attention to the north, conquered Nolambavadi , marched beyond the Tungabhadra river and reached Ballary and Kummata that Vikramaditya VI saw an imminent threat to his power. The Chalukya emperor dispatched his trusted generals Achugi II and Permadi of the Sinda family of Yerambarge (or Yelburga ) to deal with the situation. After several pitched battles in Goa, Kannegala, Halasur and Hosavidu between c.1117-1122, Vishnuvardhana and his supporters had to accept Chalukya suzerainty. [24] [4] [25] [5]
Success in Chola and Gurjara country
From the beginning of his rule, Vikramaditya VI maintained the policy of interference in the affairs of Vengi and Kanchi. He invaded and captured Kanchi in 1085 and held it for a few years. He managed to conquer parts of Vengi in 1088. He held the Kollipakei-7000 province of Vengi for many years. Vengi came under his rule again from 1093 to 1099. The Cholas re-captured it in 1099. In 1115 Kulothunga Chola I recalled his son Vikrama Chola who was the viceroy of Vengi to focus on affairs in Kanchi. Encouraged by the Hoysala success against the Cholas at Talakad and utilising the vacuum in the leadership in Vengi, Vikramaditya VI sent his famous general Anantapala to invade Vengi which was duly conquered and came under his rule from 1118 to 1124. Western Chalukyan commanders are seen controlling some other parts of Telugu country also and the Chola influence over Vengi disappeared for many years. After Vikramaditya's death in 1126, the Cholas began a slow process of encroachment over Vengi. By 1133 Vikrama Chola was able to re-capture Vengi from Vikramaditya VI's mild son Someshvara III . [26] [4] [27] Before 1088, Vikramaditya VI subdued the recalcitrant Shilahara King Bhoja I and the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri. He invaded Lata (modern Gujarat), plundered and burnt the royal capital of the Gurjara Chalukya King Karna, and stopped the advances of Kalachuri king Jajjaladeva of Ratnapur. He dealt firmly with the revolting Kadamba feudatory of Goa but gave his daughter Maila Devi in marriage to King Jayakeshi II. [4] [15]

Paigah Tombs or Maqhbara Shams al-Umara, are the tombs belonging to the nobility of Paigah family , who were fierce loyalists of the Nizams , served as statespeople, philanthropists and generals under and alongside them. The Paigah tombs are among the major wonders of Hyderabad State which are known for their architectural excellence as shown in their laid mosaic tiles and craftsmanship work. [1] Since it was Amir-e-Kabir H.E. Nawab Sir Khursheed Jah Bahadur who built the Paigah Tombs, he gave special preference in terms of construction to his immediate family. Of all the arches at Paigah Tombs, it is only the arch of his family's tomb that is bigger when compared with others. the entire necropolis was built earlier then the architecture
would have been the same for all the tombs but instead in terms of architectural beauty, the tomb of Nawab Sir Khursheed Jah's family was given special preference. The largest arch and the double maqbara inside known as
""Mahajar"" cannot be seen inside any other tomb and also to mention the beautifully decorated stucco work in the tomb of Lateefunnisa Begum
Saheba (Grandmother of Sir Khursheed Jah) is not found in any other tomb. The tombstone of
Lateefunnisa Begum Saheba, on which is already mentioned was built by Nawab Sir Khursheed Jah Bahadur. ""Lateefunnisa Begum Saheba Jid'de
Mohammed Mohiuddin Khan
Khursheed Jah Tayyari ye
Mohammed Mohiuddin Khan
Khursheed Jah Bahadur.""
The word ""Jid'de"" over here would mean Grandmother of Sir Khursheed Jah Bahadur and ""Tayyari'ye Mohammed Mohiuddin Khan
Khursheed Jah Bahadur"" would mean ""Prepared by Khursheed Jah Bahadur."" Inside this tomb are the graves of Nawab Sir Khursheed Jah Bahadur's immediate family members. Shahzadi Hussainunnisa Begum (Wife), Shahzadi Hashmatunnisa Begum (Mother), Amir-e-Kabir Nawab Mohammed Rasheeduddin Khan Bahadur (Father) and Hussaini Begum (second wife of Nawab Rasheeduddin Khan). The Paigah 's necropolis is located in a quiet neighbourhood 4  km southeast of Charminar Hyderabad , at Phisal banda suburb, down a small lane across from Owaisi Hospital near Santosh Nagar. These tombs are made out of lime and mortar with beautiful inlaid marble carvings. These tombs are 200 years old and represent the final resting places of several generations of the Paigah Nobles. [2] [3] [4]
Mosque at Paigah Tombs complex
At first, Paigah Tombs may look deserted and uncared for, but on a closer look, you will find the place quite enthralling. With marvellous carvings and motifs in floral designs and inlaid mosaic tile works, the tombs are exquisite to walk around. The tombs and their walls are delicately carved and enclosed in pierced marble facades, some of them in rows and some with beautifully carved screens and canopies.
The place is easily approachable and is set amidst a labyrinth of concrete houses built around the 30 acres of property in which the tombs are nestled. They are almost obscure and a marvellous piece of artistry in marble lost in time. The Indo-Islamic architecture is a mix of both the Asaf Jahi and the Rajputana styles of architecture. You will also see décor in fabulous stucco work, representing the Mughal, Persian and Deccan styles too.
History
[ edit ]
The noble families of Paigah , during the 18th century were the most influential and powerful families of the Princely State of Hyderabad ’s aristocracy are the descendants of the Omar bin Al-Khattab , Islam’s second caliph, comprising the area of their Jagirs to 4000 sq. miles. Their ancestor was Abdul Fateh Khan Tegh Jung who came to Deccan with Asaf Jah 1st and founded the Paigah nobility. He rendered service to the second Nizam , who ruled between 1760 and 1803 and received the highest position of Commander in chief with the title of Shams-ul-Umra, meaning the sun among the nobles. Their distinguished family background, their valuable services to the Nizam 's generation and also matrimonial alliances with the ruling Nizams made them the highest ranking nobles next only to the Nizams . They Constructed several palaces in the City notable among them were Asman Garh Palace , Khursheed Jah Devdi , Vicar-ul-Umarahi palace and also the famous Falaknuma Palace , they were believed to be wealthier than the average Maharajah of the country and were the only ones to have the privilege of maintaining their own court, palaces, as well as their own private armies, which often numbered several thousand.[ citation needed ]
Abdul Fateh Khan Tegh Jung was the first who buried in 1786 at the place which later became the family Maqbara built as per the generations of the members of their families, mostly renovated by his son Amir-e-Kabir I (in the 1880s some additions were made by Sir Asman Jah, Sir Khurshid Jah, and Sir Vikar Ul Umra)., the tombs of several generations of the Paigah nobles include Abul Fatah Khan Shums ul Umra I to Shums ul Umra v, Sir Asman Jah , Sir Khursheed Jah , Sir Vicar-ul-Umra , Sultan ul Mulk, Lady Vicar ul Umra, Lady Khurshid Jah, Lady Asman Jah, Moin ud Dowla, Zaheer yar Jung, Zayd Yar Khan and other members of the Paigah Family.
The Paigah tombs are near to the Dargah of Barhana Shah Sahab are very delicate and splendor works of art in Mughal Provinces Style. Though these stunning tombs are strewn over 35-40 acres, tombs of the Paigah as who had married daughters of the Nizams and their spouses are confined to a two-acre site. It is this enclosure which is now known as Paigah tombs., are in the shape of chaukhandis with latticed panels but open to sky. As all the Nizam 's tombs till the ascending to the throne by 7th Nizams were exposed to the sky, to emulate the tomb of Mughal emperor Aurangazeb , of whom the Nizam were the governor . So the Paigah nobles preferred their graves to be without any roof. It is as per the simple tenets of Islam. The surrounding beautiful structure of walls have latticed panels with geometrical and floral design. The delicate polished stucco work and Jali is art is tic which represents the general style of the period.[ citation needed ]
At The Mausoleum
[ edit ]
The sublime beauty of Paigah Tombs has enchanted many through the years. It lies just 6 km from Hyderabad making the location easily accessible. A cranked up signage stating the name will welcome you. As you step inside the compound you will be instantly transformed into an era where beauty and craftsmanship went hand in hand, even if it was to follow them in the after-life! Each step you take around the mausoleum will bring you closer to the exemplary craftsmanship with elaborately carved canopies and marble inlaid floral designs. The most fascinating aspect about the destination is that none of the designs are repetitive. Each of the Paigah noble’s tombs features something uniquely different and part of the wonder is in discovering the differences in the carvings.
It is a treasure house of intricately designed latticework. It fills one with such wonder to see the delicately carved wooden doors and window screens done in jaali (perforated) work. Even though there is little to seek beyond the tombs, one can spend hours here walking through its passages and enclosed areas. Photographers must come here to watch and capture the shadows which play on each tomb and its rich carvings.[ citation needed ]
Architecture and design
[ edit ]
The style of architecture of the Paigah Tombs is an amalgam of Mughal and Moorish styles resulting in a unique synthesis. The crypts, made of lime and mortar, have intricate marble inlay work and stucco reminiscent of Granada and Seville in Spain. These tombs are magnificent structures, decorated in stucco work, and represent the Moghal, Greek, Persian, Asaf Jahi , Rajasthani and Deccani style of architecture which are unique specimens of extraordinary artistry that is ardently visible in the wonderfully inlaid mosaic work. The geometrical designs in the Paigah Tombs are unique and are perforated with screens with great craftsmanship. Which has been constructed by Amir e Kabir I (Details of which are available in the diary of the Viceroy and the letter written by the then Resident J.C Bayley to Nawab Salar Jung the then prime minister Informing him about important details regarding tombs on 10 March 1882 after the death of the Co-Regent and Amir E Kabir III Nawab Rashid uddin Khan Bahadur informing Sir Salar Jung that all the three Amirs wanted to perform the  Urs of their Grand Father and Great Grand Father on the same day, he advised The Prime minister to see to it that all three Paigahs perform the Urs ceremony at the same time to maintain protocol and to avoid a situation in which who would perform first could be discussed)Nawab Sir Asman Jah Bahadur, Sir Khurshid Jah and Sir Vikar Ul Umra later made some additions which included the chowkhandis of marble added by Sir Khurshid Jah (this was taken up when Sir Khurshid Jah  ordered 18 Chowkhandis over the shrines of Important holy saints all over India. The last addition was made by Lady Vikar ul Umra for herself and her son Nawab Sultan ul Mulk Bahadur Beside the tomb of Amir e Kabir III Nawab Rashid uddin Khan Bahadur. It is in Hyderabad. These structures are specimens of remarkable artistry showing itself off in exquisite inlaid mosaic work. Local people claim that the geometrical patterns of the sculptural features of these tombs are unique and not found anywhere in the world.[ citation needed ]
Restoration work is being undertaken by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture to restore the missing architectural features, replace faulty repairs, and fix structural cracks. [5]
The Tombs
[ edit ]
The detail of the stuccowork on these structures is intricate. They have become extremely popular because of the geometrical features carved on them. Apart from the geometrical designs, the floral designs, trellis marble fencing, and canopies are also very intricate and beautiful.
The Tomb of Asman Jah and Begum Khurshid Jah attract maximum number of tourists. The structures are made of marble and were once adorned with precious and semi-precious stones which changed colours with the change of seasons. The Tombs are enclosed by a wall which is ornamented with lattice work and exotic floral and geometric designs. Each wall is done up differently with fruits, drums, serpents, flowers, vases, etc.
The mausoleums themselves feature differing designs but all have exemplary craftsmanship, utilizing elaborate canopies and marble fences done in trellis-work that are made up of geometric and floral designs. Arches fringed by smaller semi-circular arches–a feature unique to India–are also employed. Each of the Paigah noble’s tomb feature something unique different and part of the wonder is discovering each of the difference. All of these are housed by walls that are intricately designed by a wealth of latticework and exotic designs.

Mahesh Babu (born 9 August 1975) is an Indian actor, producer, and media personality who works in Telugu cinema . He is one of the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema . Born on the 9th of August, 1975, he  first appeared in the 1979 film Needa when he was four years old. He continued to perform as a child actor in several films, most of which featured his father Krishna .Following his role as the titular protagonist in Balachandrudu (1990) while still a child, his career went on hiatus so he could concentrate on his education until taking on his first lead role as an adult in the 1999 film Rajakumarudu , for which he won the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut. Afterwards, his career stagnated until successes like Murari (2001), Okkadu (2003) and Athadu (2005) brought him fame..Athadu is widely considered to be a modern classic of Telugu cinema. It holds the record of being the most telecasted Telugu film with over 1,000 times on television.. In 2006, he played a gangster in the Puri Jagannadh -directed action-thriller Pokiri . The film became the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time , and according to Vogue India , cemented Babu's reputation as a ""superstar"". In its lifetime, Pokiri grossed ₹66 crore and collected a distributor share of ₹42 crore at the global box office.In the wake of the failures of Sainikudu (2006) and Athidhi (2007), Babu took a long-term break from cinema for personal reasons. His next project, the fantasy action film Khaleja , was released in 2010 after significant delays.. The film was listed in the Film Companion 's ""25 Greatest Telugu Films of the Decade."". In 2011, he starred in Dookudu , which became the first Telugu film to gross over 100 crores. Businessman (2012), his next film, was well received and became one of the year's highest grossing Telugu films at a time that was particularly harsh on other big-budget productions. The film collected a distributor share of ₹44.8 crore and grossed over ₹90 crore in its lifetime at the global box office. The following year, Babu co-starred alongside Venkatesh in the critically and commercially acclaimed drama film Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu , which was considered the first Telugu multi-starrer in decades. Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu netted ₹38.75 crore at the AP/Nizam box office during its run, earning a distributor share of ₹51 crore at the global box office and declared a commercial success. He then featured in Sukumar 's 2014 psychological thriller film 1: Nenokkadine . Although Babu's performance as a schizophrenic rock star was lauded by critics, the film itself received mixed reviews and failed to recover its budget. The film earned a distributor share of about ₹28.9 crore, on a budget of ₹70 crore..The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, praising Sukumar's direction, screenplay, writing, musical score, emotional weight, cinematography, action sequences and cast performances (especially Babu), however the complexity in screenplay and length received mixed reception. The film won three awards from eight nominations at the 4th South Indian International Movie Awards , and two awards at the 11th CineMAA Awards . The film is considered one of the ""25 Greatest Telugu Films Of The Decade"" by Film Companion .. Aagadu , his next release that year, suffered a similar fate, despite the film's opening gross being his highest at the time. Aagadu grossed ₹18.02 crore within its first two days. However, it underperformed at the box office, failing to recover its budget of ₹65 crore during its theatrical run. The film's failure was primarily attributed to its similarities with Dookudu and other successful Telugu films. ( Full article... )

The Victoria Cross
The Victoria Cross (VC) was awarded to 153 members of the British Indian Army and civilians under its command, from 1857 until independence in 1947. The Victoria Cross is a military decoration awarded for valour ""in the face of the enemy"" to members of armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories. It takes precedence over all other Orders, decorations and medals. It may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command. The VC is traditionally presented to the recipient by the British monarch during an investiture at Buckingham Palace , though in a large number of cases this was not possible and it was presented in the field by a prominent civil or military official. The VC was introduced in Great Britain on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War .Indian troops were not originally eligible for the VC, because since 1837 they had been eligible for the Indian Order of Merit —the oldest British gallantry award for general issue. When the VC was created, Indian troops were still controlled by the British East India Company , and did not come under Crown control until 1860. European officers and men serving with the East India Company were not eligible for the Indian Order of Merit ; the VC was extended to cover them in October 1857. It was only at the end of the 19th century that calls for Indian troops to be awarded the VC intensified. Indian troops became eligible for the award in 1911. The first awards to Indian troops appeared in The London Gazette on 7 December 1914 to Darwan Singh Negi and Khudadad Khan , whose gallantry on 31 October 1914 was nearly a month earlier than Negi's gallantry on 24/25 November. Negi was presented with the VC by King George V two days earlier, on 5 December 1914, during a visit to troops in France. He is one of a small number of soldiers presented with his award before it appeared in the London Gazette. ( Full article... )

The department is also responsible for drafting and implementation of the tourism policy, including heritage, air service, and eco-tourism policies for Uttar Pradesh. [1]
History
[ edit ]
To promote tourism, the Directorate of Tourism was established in the 1972 with a Director/Director General who is an IAS officer. In 1974 the Uttar Pradesh State Tourism Development Corporation was established to look after the commercial tourist activities. The organisation is now simply known as ""Uttar Pradesh Tourism"". [2]
To boost the tourism in the state from within the country and other parts of the world, the Government of Uttar Pradesh established an Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc covering the cities of Ayodhya , Mathura , Vrindavan , Agra , Mirzapur , Lucknow and Varanasi and organised ""Uttar Pradesh Travel Mart"" in 2015 in Lucknow. The event was attended by 80 delegates from 27 countries. [3]
Organisation

Yoga tourism
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Travel with the purpose of experiencing yoga
Some yoga tourists travel to India to become certified yoga teachers, like these participants in a 200-hour Ashtanga yoga teacher training in Rishikesh .
Yoga tourism is travel with the specific purpose of experiencing some form of yoga , whether spiritual or postural . The former is a type of spiritual tourism ; the latter is related both to spiritual and to wellness tourism . Yoga tourists often visit ashrams in India to study yoga or to be trained and certified as yoga teachers . Major centres for yoga tourism include Rishikesh and Mysore .
While the Himalayas is the birthplace of yoga and a major yoga tourism destination, yoga retreats and holidays are provided in many countries, varying from simple stays in guesthouses and ashrams to 5-star comfort in luxury resorts.
Wellness tourism and spiritual tourism
Tourists practising Virabhadrasana I in Poon Hill , Nepal
Yoga is an ancient spiritual practice . From this perspective, yoga tourism can be seen as a form of spiritual tourism , involving the embracing and commodification of that practice by the Western world. There is a tension between the purely spiritual and transformational goals of yoga, meaning union with an entity higher than the self, and the commercialisation inherent in mass tourism . [1]
Especially when considering yoga as exercise , yoga tourism is seen by some scholars of tourism as a form of wellness tourism , in which people choose to go on a journey to further their health and well-being. In this context, yoga is taken to deliver physical benefits such as strength, flexibility, and relief from back pain; and mental benefits such as reduction of stress. [2] [3] More specifically, when seen as a form of wellness tourism, it is defined as ""tourism which focuses on the union of body, mind and spirit, but which is essentially areligious"". [4]
A study of the global yoga tourism market estimated its value at $181 billion in 2022, and projected that this would grow to $319 billion by 2032. [5]

India has become a major destination for yoga tourism, following on from Sri Swami Sivananda Saraswati Maharaj 's arrival in Rishikesh in 1922 to promote his philosophy of yoga. [6] In 1968, the English rock band the Beatles travelled to Rishikesh to take part in a Transcendental Meditation training course at Maharishi Mahesh Yogi 's ashram , a Hindu monastery. The visit sparked widespread Western interest in Indian spirituality, [6] and has led many Westerners to travel to India hoping to find ""authentic"" [7] yoga in ashrams in places such as Mysore (for Ashtanga Yoga ) and Rishikesh . [8] That movement led in turn to the creation of many yoga schools offering teacher training and promotion of India as a ""yoga tourism hub"" [9] by the Indian Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of AYUSH . [7] [10] [9] In 2014, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi , addressing the United Nations , announced an annual Day of Yoga on 21 June. [11] This was adopted as the International Day of Yoga by the United Nations. [12]
Other venues
[ edit ]
A yoga holiday in Fiji
Yoga tourism does not necessarily mean travel to an ashram, nor necessarily to India, though as the birthplace of yoga it is the activity's locus classicus . Ashrams offering yoga exist, for example, in Canada. [13] Other possible types of venue describe themselves as ""holistic centres"" and ""yoga holidays"", including holidays at ""a 5-star resort with a celebrity Yoga Teacher"". [13] Yoga holidays are provided in countries including Greece, Sri Lanka, Japan, Thailand, Scotland, France, Morocco, England, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the Maldives and Wales. [14] [15] Yoga retreats can be found in many countries, including for instance Costa Rica and Italy. [13] Hotels and guesthouses around the world similarly offer yoga holidays in countries such as Bulgaria and Turkey; ""pastoral yoga"" can be found in countries including France. [13]
Reception
[ edit ]
Youthful Westerners' sometimes naive spiritual quests to India, and the many varieties of ashram and yoga on offer to them, are gently [16] satirised in the Mindful Yoga instructor Anne Cushman 's novel Enlightenment for Idiots. [17] [16]
Elizabeth Gilbert 's 2006 memoir Eat, Pray, Love , now also a romantic Hollywood film , describes her experiences in an Indian ashram on her journey of self-discovery . [13] Gilbert is thought [18] to have stayed in the Siddha Yoga ashram Gurudev Siddha Peeth in Maharashtra ; the film's ""Pray"" section was set in Ashram Hari Mandir at Pataudi , near Delhi. [18]

Tourism in Thiruvananthapuram district in the Indian state of Kerala promotes the area's hill stations , backwaters , beaches, lagoons, and wildlife sanctuaries. The area is a tourism destination and receives chartered flights  for medical tourism , as there are more than a hundred recognised Ayurveda centres in and around the city. This is primarily due to Ayurveda's popularity in foreign countries. Medical tourism is further promoted by modern medicine hospitals in the city. Recuperation facilities are available at five-star beach resorts and hill stations nearby.
Agastyakoodam
Main article: Agastyakoodam
Situated on the eastern side of the district [1] at about 1,869 metres (6,132 ft) above sea level, Agasthyarkoodam is one of the highest peaks in the Western Ghats and is the second highest peak in Kerala after Anamudi which is the highest peak in the Western Ghats. Tradition says that the great sage Agasthya lived on this peak. Noted for its abundant ayurvedic herbs, the cone-shaped mountain is a centre of pilgrimage for Hindus because of Agastya, who was a confirmed bachelor. Hence, the aborigines dislike the presence of women on the hill and they are forbidden from ascending the peak.[ citation needed ]. Agasthyavanam Biological Park offers trekking opportunities.
Vizhinjam
[ edit ]
Vizhinjam Port site
About two km south of Kovalam , Vizhinjam is believed to have been an ancient port. Now, Vizhinjam is a fishing harbour, with a light house. The Portuguese and the Dutch had commercial establishments here. The Portuguese have built a church in Vizhinjam near to the sea shore, which is still functional and is referred as the Old Vizhinjam Church. [2] It is located in the vizhinjam fishing harbour area. This place is being developed into an international deep water container transshipment terminal because of its proximity to international shipping lanes and its natural depth. [3]

India - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/India,"The Qutub Minar , 73 m (240 ft) tall, completed by the Sultan of Delhi , Iltutmish
The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. [109] When Harsha of Kannauj , who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. [110] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal . [110] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south. [110] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region. [109] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes. [111] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences. [111]
In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language. [112] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent . [112] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. [113] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation. [113] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar , Thailand , Laos , Brunei , Cambodia , Vietnam , Philippines , Malaysia , and Indonesia . [114] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages. [114]
After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206. [115] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs. [116] [117] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. [118] [119] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire . [120] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India, [121] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards. [120]
Early modern India
In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers, [122] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors. [123] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices [124] [125] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, [126] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. [127] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar , the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status. [126] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture [128] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, [129] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. [127] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, [127] resulting in greater patronage of painting , literary forms, textiles, and architecture . [130] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas , the Rajputs , and the Sikhs , gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience. [131] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India. [131] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs. [132]

By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company , had established coastal outposts. [133] [134] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. [135] [133] [136] [137] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s. [138] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period. [133] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture. [139]
Modern India
Main article: History of India (1947–present)
Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe . [140] [141] [142] [143] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule. [144] [145] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. [146] [147] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885. [148] [149] [150] [151]
The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets. [152] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines , [153] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians. [154] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption. [155] The railway network provided critical famine relief, [156] notably reduced the cost of moving goods, [156] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry. [155]

After World War I , in which approximately one million Indians served , [157] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation , by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol. [158] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections. [159] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II , the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism . All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan. [160]
Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic. [161] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical know-how, [162] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing economies , [163] and increased its geopolitical clout. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban; [164] by religious and caste-related violence ; [165] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies ; [166] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India . [167] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China [168] and with Pakistan . [168] India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved. [169]
Geography
Main article: Geography of India
India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate , a part of the Indo-Australian Plate . [170] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana , began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east. [170] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust , to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate . [170] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle , both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas . [170] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment [171] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain . [172] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range , which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert , the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis. [173] [174] [175]
The Tungabhadra , with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsular Krishna River . [176]

The remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India , the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east. [177] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau , is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats ; [178] the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude [n] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude. [179]
India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. [180] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores. [180]
Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra , both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal . [181] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi ; the latter's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes. [182] [183] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari , the Mahanadi , the Kaveri , and the Krishna , which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; [184] and the Narmada and the Tapti , which drain into the Arabian Sea . [185] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. [186] India has two archipelagos : the Lakshadweep , coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea . [187]
Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons . [188] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. [189] [190] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. [188] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet , tropical dry , subtropical humid , and montane . [191]
Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and 2018. [192] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra . [193] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century. [194]
Biodiversity
Main articles: Forestry in India and Wildlife of India
India is a megadiverse country , a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous , or endemic , to them. [195] India is the habitat for 8.6% of all mammals , 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. [196] [197] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic. [198] India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots , [69] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism. [o] [199]
India's most dense forests, such as the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands , the Western Ghats , and Northeast India , occupy approximately 3% of its land area. [200] [201] Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land area. [200] [201] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas , the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India. [202] India has two natural zones of thorn forest , one in the Deccan Plateau , immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible. [203]
Among the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica , or neem, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine , [204] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa , or peepul, [205] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro , [206] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment. [207]
Many Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana , the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago. [208] India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. [209] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographic passes flanking the Himalayas. [210] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India's mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians. [197] Among endemics are the vulnerable [211] hooded leaf monkey [212] and the threatened [213] Beddome's toad [213] [214] of the Western Ghats.
India contains 172 IUCN -designated threatened animal species , or 2.9% of endangered forms. [215] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin . Critically endangered species include the gharial , a crocodilian ; the great Indian bustard ; and the Indian white-rumped vulture , which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac -treated cattle. [216] Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah ; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct. [217] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas , first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act [218] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988. [219] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen biosphere reserves , [220] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves ; seventy-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention . [221]
India has the majority of the world's wild tigers , approximately 3,170 in 2022. [222]

Wesleyan Methodist Connexion
The Wesleyan Methodist Church (also named the Wesleyan Methodist Connexion) was the majority Methodist movement in England following its split from the Church of England after the death of John Wesley and the appearance of parallel Methodist movements.
The word Wesleyan in the title differentiated it from the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists (who were a majority of the Methodists in Wales) and from the Primitive Methodist movement, which separated from the Wesleyans in 1807. [2] The Wesleyan Methodist Church followed John and Charles Wesley in holding to an Arminian theology, in contrast to the Calvinism held by George Whitefield , by Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon (founder of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion ), and by Howell Harris and Daniel Rowland , the pioneers of Welsh Methodism . Its Conference was also the legal successor to John Wesley as holder of the property of the original Methodist societies. [3]
Name and origins

The name ""Wesleyan"" emerged as early as 1740 to distinguish John Wesley's followers from other Methodists, such as "" Whitefieldites "" and the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion. But it did not come into more general and formal use until early in the 19th century, when it served to differentiate the ""Original Connexion "" from its offshoots and, in Wales, from Calvinistic Methodism . [4] Broadly, the term Wesleyan (in the sense of ""deriving from the Wesleys"") has been used to describe Methodist theology held by almost all Methodist groups in England and America.
History
See also: Methodist Church of Great Britain § History
Although it was not his intention to establish a new Christian denomination , John Wesley's clandestine ordinations in 1784 [a] had made separation from the established Church of England virtually inevitable. [5] Later in the same year, Wesley pronounced the first official Methodist Conference of 100 members, who were to govern the society of the Methodist movement after his death. [6] In 1787 Wesley, under legal advice, decided to license his chapels and itinerant preachers under the Toleration Act 1689 , albeit ""not as dissenters but simply 'preachers of the gospel '"". [7] Wesley died in 1791. The estrangement between the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodists was entrenched by the decision of the Methodist Conference of 1795 to permit the administration of the Lord's Supper in any chapel where both a majority of the trustees and a majority of the stewards and leaders allowed it. [8] This permission was extended to the administration of baptism, burial and timing of chapel services, bringing Methodist chapels into competition with the local parish church . Consequently, known Methodists were often excluded from the Church of England, accelerating the trend for Methodism to become entirely separate from the established church.
For half a century after Wesley's death, the Methodist movement was characterised by a series of divisions, normally on matters of church government (e.g. Methodist New Connexion ) and separate revivals (e.g. Primitive Methodism in Staffordshire, 1811, and the Bible Christian Church in south-west England, 1815). The original movement became known as the ""Wesleyan Methodist Connexion"" to distinguish itself from these groups. During the Napoleonic era , the Wesleyan Methodist hierarchy was eager to display loyalty to a government wary of radicalism , leading to a politically conservative stance among both the leadership and many members, in contrast to other Methodist groups. [4] The 1891 Wesleyan conference endorsed the use of the term Church rather than Connexion, although it retained a connexional polity . [9]
Methodist Central Hall, Westminster
In 1898, Robert Perks , MP for Louth , proposed the creation of the Wesleyan Methodist Twentieth Century Fund (also known as the 'One Million Guinea Fund') which aimed to raise one million guineas (£1.1s. or £1.05) from one million Methodists to build a Central London church to build a world centre of Wesleyan Methodism and to expand the mission of the Wesleyan Church at home and overseas. [10] On 8 November 1898, the fund was officially launched at Wesley's Chapel in City Road , London. The fund had raised £1,073,682 by the time it closed in 1909, part of which was used to purchase the former Royal Aquarium site for the construction of the Methodist Central Hall, Westminster , [11] and to support construction and extension of other Wesleyan Methodist churches and Sunday schools around the UK and overseas. [12]
Unification
[ edit ]
In 1932, the Wesleyan Methodist Church in England had 447,122 members , against a combined total of 338,568 from the Primitive Methodist and United Methodist Churches. That same year, the "" Methodist Union "" saw the Wesleyan Methodists reunite with these groups. [4] The Union was driven by a desire for greater unity among Methodists and to streamline administrative structures. The resulting Methodist Church of Great Britain became the largest Methodist denomination in the country, bringing together various strands of Methodism under one organisation.
Schools and education
[ edit ]
John Wesley was convinced of the importance of education and, following the advice of his friend Philip Doddridge , opened schools at The Foundery in London, and at Newcastle and Kingswood . Following the upsurge in interest in education which accompanied the extension of franchise in 1832, the Methodist Conference commissioned William Atherton , Richard Treffry and Samuel Jackson to report on Methodist schools, coming to the conclusion that if the Church were to prosper the system of Sunday schools (3,339 in number at that time, with 59,277 teachers and 341,442 pupils) should be augmented by day-schools with teachers educated to high school level. The Rev. John Scott [13] proposed in 1843 that 700 new Methodist day-schools be established within seven years. Though a steady increase was achieved, that ambitious target could not be reached, in part limited by the number of suitably qualified teachers, mostly coming from the institution founded in Glasgow by David Stow . The outcome of the Wesleyan Education Report for 1844 was that planning began for permanent Wesleyan teacher-training college, resulting in the foundation of Westminster Training College in Horseferry Road , Westminster in 1851, with the Rev. Scott as its first principal. [14]

Protected areas of India
e
There are four categories of protected areas in India, constituted under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 . Tiger reserves consist of areas under national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. There are 53 tiger reserves in India. [1] As of January 2023, [update] the protected areas of India cover 173,629.52 square kilometres (67,038.73 sq mi), roughly 5.28% of the total geographical area of the country. [2]
Classification
Main article: National parks of India
National parks in India are IUCN category II protected areas . India's first national park was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park, now known as Jim Corbett National Park , Uttarakhand . By 1970, India only had five national parks. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger in 1973 to safeguard the habitats of conservation reliant species . As of January 2023, [update] India has 106 national parks covering 44,402.95 square kilometres (17,144.07 sq mi), roughly 1.35% of the total geographical area of the country. [3]
Wildlife sanctuaries
Main article: Wildlife sanctuaries of India
Wildlife sanctuaries of India are classified as IUCN Category IV protected areas . Between 1936 and 2022, 567 wildlife sanctuaries were established in the country that cover 122,564.86 km2 (47,322.56 sq mi), roughly 3.73% of the geographical area of the country. [4] Among these, the 53 tiger reserves [1] are governed by Project Tiger , and are of special significance for the conservation of the Bengal tiger .
Biosphere reserves
Main article: Biosphere reserves of India
The Indian government has established 18 biosphere reserves [5] (categories roughly correspondingly to IUCN Category V Protected areas ) to protect larger areas of natural habitat than a typical national park or animal sanctuary , and that often include one or more national parks or reserves, along with buffer zones that are open to some economic uses. Protection is granted not only to the flora and fauna of the protected region, but also to the human communities who inhabit these regions, and their ways of life.
Reserved and protected forests
Main article: Reserved forests and protected forests of India
Reserved forests and protected forest ( IUCN Category IV or VI , depending on protection accorded): These are forested lands where logging, hunting, grazing and other activities may be permitted on a sustainable basis to members of certain communities. In reserved forests, explicit permission is required for such activities. In protected forests, such activities are allowed unless explicitly prohibited. Thus, in general reserved forests enjoy a higher degree of protection with respect to protected forests.
Conservation and community reserves
Main article: Conservation reserves and community reserves of India
Conservation reserves and community reserves in India are terms denoting protected areas of India which typically act as buffer zones to or connectors and migration corridors between established national parks , wildlife sanctuaries and reserved and protected forests of India. Such areas are designated as conservation areas if they are uninhabited and completely owned by the Government of India but used for subsistence by communities, and community areas if part of the lands are privately owned. Administration of such reserves would be through local people and local agencies like the gram panchayat , as in the case of communal forests. (See Communal forests of India )
Village and panchayat forests
Main article: Communal forests of India
A ""Common Important Forest"" in India is a forest governed by local communities in a way compatible with sustainable development . Such forests are typically called village forests or panchayat forests, reflecting the fact that the administration and resource use of the forest occurs at the village and panchayat (an elected rural body) levels. Hamlets, villages and communities of villages may actually administer such a forest. [6] Such community forests are usually administered by a locally elected body, usually called the Forest Protection Committee, Village Forest Committee or the Village Forest Institution. Such committees are known as Van Panchayats in the Kumaon Division of Uttarakhand , Forest Co-operative Societies in Himachal Pradesh and Van Samrakshan Samitis in Andhra Pradesh . Legislation pertaining to communal forests vary from state to state, but typically the state government retains some administrative control over matters like staff appointment, and penalization of offenders. Such forests typically conform to the IUCN Category VI Protected Areas , but protection may be enforced by the local communities or the government depending on local legislation. Maharashtra is the state with the most forest land while Haryana has the least.
Private protected areas
Main article: Private protected areas of India
Private protected areas of India refer to protected areas inside India whose land rights are owned by an individual or a corporation / organization, and where the habitat and resident species are offered some kind of protection from exploitative activities like hunting, logging, etc. The Government of India did not provide any legal or physical protection to such entities, but in an important amendment introduced by the Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act of 2002 , has agreed to protect communally owned areas of ecological value.
Conservation areas
[ edit ]
Conservation Areas in India refer to well-demarcated large geographical entities with an established conservation plan, and were part of a joint Indo-US project on ""landscape management and protection"". The project ran from 1996 to 2002. These areas are home to many Conservation reliant species .

Nizam of Hyderabad
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Historic monarch of the Hyderabad State of India
""Nizam"" redirects here. For other uses, see Nizam (disambiguation) .
Nizam-ul-Mulk of Hyderabad Deccan
Coat of Arms of the Hyderabad
First to reign Chin Qilich Khan 31 July 1724 – 1 June 1748
Details
Mir Osman Ali Khan
Nizam of Hyderabad was the title of the ruler of Hyderabad State (now [update] part of the Indian state of Telangana , the Marathwada region of Maharashtra and the Kalyana-Karnataka region of Karnataka ). Nizam is a shortened form of Niẓām ul-Mulk ( Persian : نظام‌ الملک; lit. 'Administrator of the Realm'), and was the title bestowed upon Asaf Jah I when he was appointed Viceroy of the Deccan by the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar . In addition to being the Mughal Viceroy ( Naib ) of the Deccan, Asaf Jah I was also the premier courtier of the Mughal Empire until 1724, when he established an independent realm based in Hyderabad , but in practice, continued to recognise the nominal authority of emperor.
The Asaf Jahi dynasty was founded by Chin Qilich Khan (Asaf Jah I), who served as a Naib of the Deccan sultanates under the Mughal Empire from 1713 to 1721. He intermittently ruled the region after Emperor Aurangzeb 's death in 1707. In 1724 Mughal control weakened, and Asaf Jah became virtually independent. [1] [2] [3] Later the Nizam defeated the Marathas with the alliance of the British.
When the English East India Company achieved paramountcy over the Indian subcontinent , they allowed the Nizams to continue to rule their princely states as client kings. The Nizams retained internal power over Hyderabad State until 17 September 1948, when Hyderabad was integrated into the new Indian Union. [4]
The Asaf Jahi dynasty had only seven recognized rulers, but there was a period of 13 unstable years after the rule of the first Nizam when two of his sons, Nasir Jung ,and Salabath Jung , and grandson Muzafur Jung ruled. They were never officially recognised[ by whom? ] as rulers. The seventh and last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan , fell from power when India annexed Hyderabad State in 1948 in Operation Polo . [5] Today, the title is held by his great grandson and pretender , Azmet Jah . [6]
History
The title Nizam comes from the Persian نظام /nɪˈzɑːm/, which itself is derived from Arabic niẓām which means ""order"" or ""arrangement"", and was typically given to high ranking state officials. [7]
Descent
[ edit ]
According to Sir Roper Lethbridge in The Golden Book of India (1893), the Nizams are lineally descended from the First Caliph Abu Bakr , the successor of the Islamic prophet Muhammed . [8] The family of Nizams in India is descended from Abid Khan , a Persian from Samarkand , whose lineage is traced to Sufi Shihab-ud-Din Suhrawardi (1154–91) of Suhraward in Iran. In the early 1650s, on his way to hajj , Abid Khan stopped in Deccan, where the young prince Aurangzeb , then Governor of Deccan, cultivated him. Abid Khan returned to the service of Aurangzeb to fight in the succession wars of 1657–58. After Aurangzeb's enthronement, Abid Khan was richly rewarded and became Aurangzeb's favourite nobleman. His son Ghazi Uddin Khan was married to Safiya Khanum, the daughter of the former imperial Grand Vizier (prime minister) Sa'dullah Khan . Mir Qamaruddin Khan , the founder of the line of Nizams, was born of the couple, thus descending from two prominent families of the Mughal court. [9]
Ghazi Uddin Khan rose to become a General of the Emperor Aurangzeb and played a vital role in conquering Bijapur and Golconda Sultanates of Southern India in 1686. [10] He also played a key role in thwarting the rebellion by Prince Akbar and alleged rebellion by Prince Mu`azzam . [11]
Map of India in 1760. Part of the southern area in green was ruled by the Nizam.
After Aurangzeb's death and during the war of succession, Qamaruddin and his father remained neutral thus escaping the risk of being on the losing side; they remained marginal players in the Mughal court during the reigns of Bahadur Shah I (1707–12) and Jahandar Shah (1712–13). Their successor Farrukhsiyar (1713–19) appointed Qamaruddin the governor of Deccan in 1713, awarding him the title Nizam-ul-Mulk. However, the governorship was taken away two years later and Qamaruddin withdrew to his estate in Moradabad . Under the next emperor, Muhammad Shah (1719–48), Qamaruddin accepted the governorship of Deccan for the second time in 1721. The next year, following the death of his uncle Muhammad Amin Khan, a power-broker in the Mughal Court, Qamaruddin returned to Delhi and was made the wazir (prime minister). According to historian Faruqui, his tenure as prime minister was undermined by his opponents and a rebellion in Deccan was engineered against him. In 1724, the Nizam returned to Deccan to reclaim his base, in the process making a transition to a semi-independent ruler. [12]
Reign
Further information: Hyderabad State
In 1724, Asaf Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the Deccan Suba, named the region Hyderabad Deccan , and started what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty . Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asaf Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad. [13] [14] Nizam I never formally declared independence from the Mughals; he still flew the Mughal flag, and was never crowned. In Friday prayers, the sermon would be conducted in the name of Aurangzeb, and this tradition continued until the end of Hyderabad State in 1948. The death of Asaf Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons, backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces, contended for the throne. The accession of Asif Jah II , who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768, he signed the treaty of Machilipatnam , surrendering the coastal region to the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent. [15]

Following the decline of the Mughal power, the region of Deccan saw the rise of the Maratha Empire . The titular Nizams themselves fought during the Mughal-Maratha Wars since the 1720s, which resulted in the Nizam paying a regular tax ( Chauth ) to the Marathas. The major battles fought between the Marathas and the Nizam include Palkhed , Bhopal , Rakshasbhuvan , and Kharda , in all of which the Nizam lost. [16] [17] Following the conquest of Deccan by Bajirao I and the imposition of Chauth by him, the Nizam essentially remained a tributary of the Marathas. [18]

In 1805, after the East India Company's victory in the Second Anglo-Maratha War , the Nizam of Hyderabad came under their protection.[ citation needed ]. In 1858, the state of Hyderabad became part of the British Indian Empire as a princely state with full autonomy albeit under colonial rule and was subject to the British Crown.
From 1876 to 1948, the Nizam recognised the Crown as paramount ruler of India as the monarch of the United Kingdom simultaneously held the title of emperor of India (first held by Queen Victoria as empress and the last being George VI as emperor)
In 1903, the Berar region of the state was separated and merged into the Central Provinces of British India , to form the Central Provinces and Berar .
During the Second World War , 80,000 men who were raised by the Nizam to form a personal army under the Indian State Forces , known as the 19th Hyderabad Regiment served in Malaya, North Africa, Persia, Singapore and Burma
The last Nizam of Hyderabad state, Mir Osman Ali Khan crowned in 1911, had been the richest man in the world in his time. [19] The Nizams developed the railway, introduced electricity, and developed roads, airways, irrigation and reservoirs; in fact, all major public buildings in Hyderabad City were built during his reign during the period of British rule in India . He pushed education, science, and the establishment of Osmania University forward.
In 1947, at the time of the partition of India , the British government offered the 565 princely states in the sub-continent the options of acceding to either India or Pakistan or remaining independent.

Common languages
The Sultanate of Golconda ( Persian : سلطنت گلکنده; Urdu : سلطنت گولکنڈه) was an early modern kingdom in southern India , ruled by the Persianate , [6] Shia Islamic Qutb Shahi dynasty [a] of Turkoman origin. [7] [8] After the decline of the Bahmani Sultanate , the Sultanate of Golconda was established in 1518 [9] by Quli Qutb Shah , as one of the five Deccan sultanates .
The kingdom extended from parts of the modern-day Indian states of Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , Odisha and Telangana . [10] The Golconda sultanate was constantly in conflict with the Adil Shahis and Nizam Shahis , which it shared borders with in the seventeenth century to the west and northwest. [11] In 1636, Mughal emperor Shah Jahan forced the Qutb Shahis to recognize Mughal suzerainty and pay periodic tributes. The dynasty came to an end in 1687 during the reign of its seventh sultan Abul Hasan Qutb Shah , when the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb arrested and jailed Abul Hasan for the rest of his life in Daulatabad , incorporating Golconda into the Mughal empire. [12] [13] [11]
The Qutb Shahis were patrons of Persianate Shia culture. [13] [14] The official and court language of the Golconda sultanate during the first 90 years of its existence (c. 1518 – 1600) was also Persian. In the early 17th century, however, the Telugu language was elevated to the status of the Persian language, while towards the end of the Qut Shahis' rule, it was the primary court language with Persian used occasionally in official documents. According to Indologist Richard Eaton, as Qutb Shahis adopted Telugu, they started seeing their polity as the Telugu-speaking state, with the elites of the sultanate viewing their rulers as ""Telugu Sultans"". [15]
History
[ edit ]
The dynasty's founder, Sultan Quli Khawas Khan Hamdani was born in Hamadan , Iran. He belonged to the Qara Qoyunlu , a Turkmen Muslim tribe and therefore a descendant of Qara Yusuf . [16] [17] In the 16th century, he migrated to Delhi with his uncle, Allah-Quli, some of his relatives and friends. Later he migrated south, to the Deccan and served the Bahmani sultan , Mahmood Shah Bahmani II , who was of Deccani Muslim ethnicity. [18] [19] He declared the independence of Golconda after the disintegration of the Bahmani Sultanate into the five Deccan sultanates . [19] He took the title Qutb Shah, and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda. He was assassinated in 1543 by his son, Jamsheed , who assumed control of the sultanate. [19] Jamsheed died in 1550 from cancer. [20] Jamsheed's young son Subhan Quli Qutb Shah reigned for a year, at which time the nobility brought back and installed Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah as sultan. [20]
Golconda, and with the construction of the Char Minar , later Hyderabad , served as capitals of the sultanate, [19] and both cities were embellished by the Qutb Shahi sultans. The dynasty ruled Golconda for 171 years, until Aurangzeb , in his campaigns in the Deccan , conquered the Sultanate of Golconda in 1687 with the completion of his siege of Golconda . [21] The sultante's last ruler, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah , was imprisoned in Daulatabad Fort , and the territory of the Golconda Sultanate was made into a Mughal imperial province, Hyderabad Subah . [22] [23]
Economy

The Golconda Sultanate was notoriously wealthy. While its primary source of revenue was a land tax, [24] the sultanate greatly profited from its monopoly on diamond production from mines in the southern districts of the kingdom. The sultanate also had control over the Krishna and Godavari deltas , giving it access to craft production in the villages of the area, where goods like textiles were produced. The town of Masulipatnam served as the Golconda Sultanate's primary seaport for the export of diamonds and textiles. The kingdom reached the peak of its financial prosperity in the 1620s and 1630s. [25] [26]
Diamonds
Main article: Golconda diamonds
Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond first discovered by the Golconda sultanate
The Golconda Sultanate was known for its diamonds which were dubbed the Golconda diamonds . These diamonds were sought after diamonds long before the Qutb Shahi dynasty came to power, and they continued to supply this demand through European traders. [27] Diamonds from mines (especially the Kollur Mine presently in Guntur district , Andhra Pradesh ) were transported to the city of Hyderabad to be cut, polished, evaluated and sold. Golconda established itself as a diamond trading centre and until the end of the 19th century, the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in the world. [28]
Cotton-weaving
[ edit ]
During the early seventeenth century, a strong cotton-weaving industry existed in the Deccan region. Large quantities of cotton cloth were produced for domestic and export consumption. High-quality plain and patterned cloth made of muslin and calico was produced. Plain cloth was available in white or brown colour, in bleached or dyed variety. This cloth was exported to Persia and European countries. The patterned cloth was made of prints which were made indigenously with indigo for blue, chay-root for red coloured prints and vegetable yellow. Patterned cloth exports were mainly to Java, Sumatra and other eastern countries. [29] Golconda had a strong trading relationship with Ayutthaya Siam. [30]
Culture
[ edit ]

The Qutb Shahis were patrons of Persianate Shia culture. [13] [14] Over the first 90 years of their rule (c. 1518 – 1600), they championed Persian culture. Their official edicts and court language were in Persian only. [15] Quli Qutb Mulk's court became a haven for Persian culture and literature. [11] In early 17th-century, with Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah (1580–1612) a change began. He began to patronize the Telugu language and culture as well. Edicts began to be issued both in Persian and Telugu. Towards the end of the dynasty, these were primarily in Telugu with a summary in Persian. As they adopted Telugu, they saw their territory as the Telugu-speaking region, states Indologist Richard Eaton, with their elites considering the rulers as ""Telugu Sultans"". [15] [31]
Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah (1580–1612) wrote poems in Dakhini Urdu, Persian and Telugu. [14] Subsequent poets and writers, however, wrote in Urdu, while using vocabulary from Persian, Hindi and Telugu languages. [14] During the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah in 1634 AD, an ancient Sanskrit text on love and sex Ratirahasya by Kokkoka was translated into Persian and named Lazzat-un-Nisa (Flavors of the Woman). [32]
Architecture
[ edit ]
The Qutb Shahi architecture was Indo-Islamic , a culmination of Indian and Persian architectural styles. [33] Their style was very similar to that of the other Deccan Sultanates . The Qutb Shahi rulers built the Char Minar . [14]

Secunderabad is a twin city of Hyderabad and one of the six zones of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) in the Indian state of Telangana . It is the headquarters of the South Central Railway zone . Named after the Mir Akbar Ali Khan Sikander Jah, Asaf Jah III , Nizam of the Asaf Jahi dynasty , Secunderabad was established in 1806 as a British cantonment . Although both the cities are together referred to as the twin cities , Hyderabad and Secunderabad have different histories and cultures, with Secunderabad having developed directly under British rule until 1948, and Hyderabad as the capital of the Nizams ' princely state of Hyderabad . [3] Since 1956, the city has housed the Rashtrapati Nilayam , the winter office of the president of India . It is also the headquarters of the 54th Infantry Division of the Indian Army . There are also many residential areas and apartments, particularly in the small neighbourhood of Yapral, with many Indian Armed Forces officials living here. [4]
Geographically divided from Hyderabad by the Hussain Sagar lake, Secunderabad is no longer a separate municipal unit and has become part of Hyderabad's Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. Both cities are collectively known as Hyderabad and together form the sixth-largest metropolis in India . Being one of the largest cantonments in India, Secunderabad has a large presence of army and air force personnel. [5] [6] Secunderabad also has a large number of lakes, with the northern part of the Hussain Sagar Lake being a part of the city and Fox Sagar Lake being the largest lake in Secunderabad. The city also houses the famous Ramoji Film City .

Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century, the areas around the present-day Hyderabad and Secunderabad came under the control of the Kakatiya dynasty (1158–1310), whose seat of power was at Warangal , 148 km (92 mi) northeast of modern Hyderabad. [8]
In 1310, the area of present-day Hyderabad and Secunderabad came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate after the capture of Warangal , the Kakatiya capital. The modern city of Hyderabad was built and founded in 1592 by the Golconda Sultanate under Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah . The modern Secunderabad is also the site where the then Mughal emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur was defeated in the year 1754 by the Maratha Empire ; the emperor arrived after the death of Nawab Anwaruddin Khan nearby at the Battle of Ambur in 1749. Anwaruddin Khan was the Nawab of Arcot .

The area around Secunderabad changed hands among various rulers, and the area was part of Nizam's Hyderabad by the 18th century. [9] [10]
Modern Secunderabad was founded as a British cantonment after Nizam Asaf Jah II was defeated by the British East India Company . He was then forced to sign the 1798 Treaty of Subsidiary Alliance [11] [12] to get the favour of British troops camped in the village of Ulwul , north-east of Hussain Sagar , the lake that separates Secunderabad from its twin city Hyderabad. In 1803, Nizam Sikandar Jah , the third Nizam of Hyderabad, changed Ulwul's name to Secunderabad after himself. [11] The city was formed in 1806, after the order was signed by the Nizam allotting the land north of Hussain Sagar to set up the British Cantonment. [13]
View of the Picket lake in Secunderabad, circa 1890
The drinking water needs of the British army in the cantonment and civilians in the cantonment area (areas now under Marredpally, Bowenpally and Tirumalgherry) were taken from Picket Lake (also known as Picket Tank), and from a few other water bodies. Picket Lake was located at the entrance of the cantonment.  Picket Lake was connected to Hussainsagar through a channel. Gradually over the years, the channel turned into a municipal drain. The lake was gradually encroached upon and later a bus station was built in its location. [14]
The twin cities are separated by the man-made Hussain Sagar lake, which was built during the reign of the Qutb Shahi dynasty in the 16th century. Unlike Hyderabad , the official language of Secunderabad was English. [15] Secunderabad was exempted from customs duty on imported goods, thus making trade very profitable. Various new markets such as Regimental Bazaar and General Bazaar were created. After the First War of Indian Independence of 1857, the construction of a 7-metre-high (23 ft) wall was started at Trimulgherry and completed in 1867. [15]
Secunderabad Junction railway station , one of the largest in India and the zonal headquarters of South Central Railway , was established in 1874. The King Edward Memorial Hospital, now known as Gandhi Hospital, was established in 1851. A civil jail (now a heritage building known as Old Jail complex near Monda Market ) was also established. [16] Originally constructed in 1860 as the country house of the British Resident at Hyderabad, the Residency House is now known as the Rashtrapati Nilayam , the official retreat of the President of India . [17]
Trimulgherry Entrenchment where British troops were stationed
Sir Winston Churchill , the prime minister of the United Kingdom during World War II, was posted in Secunderabad during the 1890s as a subaltern in the British Army. [18] Sir Ronald Ross conducted his initial research on the cause of malaria in the city of Secunderabad. [19] The original building is today called the Sir Ronald Ross Institute and is located on Minister Road.
Secunderabad Municipality was first formed in 1945. Later in 1950, along with Hyderabad Municipality, it was upgraded to Secunderabad Municipal Corporation under the Hyderabad Corporation Act, 1950. In 1960, by the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act of 1955, Secunderabad Municipal Corporation was merged with Hyderabad Corporation to form a single municipal corporation. [20] Today Secunderabad is part of the Hyderabad district .
Post-Independence, the Secunderabad Cantonment Board came under the jurisdiction of the Indian Armed forces. Consequently, large military units were established. The popular neighbourhoods in Secunderabad are Tarnaka , Paradise Circle, Trimulgherry , Jawaharnagar colony, Marredpally , Jeera, General Bazar, Sitaphalmandi , Kharkhana , Ranigunj , Yapral, Kowkur and New Bhoiguda.[ according to whom? ] Begumpet Airport is close to Secunderabad and served the twin city until early 2008.

Background and history
Main article: History of Tamil Nadu
Historically , Tamil Nadu had been inhabited by hominids more than 400 millennia ago and has more than 5,500 years of continuous cultural history . [1] [2] Tamil Nadu is the home of the Tamil people , who speak Tamil language , one of the oldest surviving languages. [3] The Tamilakam region has been ruled over by many kingdoms, major of which are the Sangam era (300 BC–AD 300) rulers of the Chera , Chola , and Pandya clans, the Pallava dynasty (3rd–9th century), and the later Vijayanagara Empire (14th–17th century). [4] European colonization began with establishing trade ports in the 17th century, with the British controlling much of the territory for two centuries before the Indian Independence in 1947. [5] [6] When India became independent in 1947, erstwhile Madras presidency became Madras State , comprising present-day Tamil Nadu and parts of other states which was subsequently split up along linguistic lines. In 1969, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning ""Tamil country"". [7]
After independence, the economy of Tamil Nadu conformed to a socialist framework, with strict governmental control over private sector participation, foreign trade , and foreign direct investment . In the 1970s while the economy of Tamil Nadu consistently exceeded national average growth rates, due to reform-oriented economic policies and the tourism industry started to develop subsequently.

Literature
[ edit ]
Tamil Nadu has an independent literary tradition dating back over 2500 years from the sangam era . Tamil literature was composed in three successive poetic assemblies known as Tamil Sangams , the earliest of which, according to ancient tradition, were held on a now vanished continent far to the south of India. [38] This Tamil literature includes the oldest grammatical treatise, Tholkappiyam , and the epics Silappatikaram and Manimekalai . [39]
Architecture
The large gopuram is a hallmark of Dravidian architecture
Dravidian architecture is the distinct style of rock architecture in Tamil Nadu. [40] In Dravidian architecture, the temples considered of porches or Mantapas preceding the door leading to the sanctum, Gate-pyramids or Gopurams in quadrangular enclosures that surround the temple and Pillared halls used for many purposes and are the invariable accompaniments of these temples. Besides these, a South Indian temple usually has a tank called the Kalyani or Pushkarni.

[42] They are topped by the kalasam, a bulbous stone finial and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex. [43] The gopuram's origins can be traced back to the Pallavas who built the group of monuments in Mahabalipuram and Kanchipuram . [44] The Cholas later expanded the same and by the Pandya rule in twelfth century, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance. [45] [46] Vimanam are similar structures built over the garbhagriha or inner sanctum of the temple but are usually smaller than the gopurams in the Dravidian architecture with a few exceptions including the Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur . [47] [48]
With the Mugal influence in medieval times and the British later, a rise in the blend of Hindu , Islamic and Gothic revival styles, resulting in the distinct Indo-Saracenic architecture with several institutions during the British era following the style.

The rock-cut caves are triple-celled with pillared hall and are devoid of any ornamental moulding or sculpture. This architecture echoes the richness of the bygone era and the tragic end of the two great secretariats of Qutub Shah.

The Director General of Police (DGP) is the highest-ranking police officer in Indian states and union territories . The DGP is appointed by the cabinet and holds a three-star rank . The DGP is responsible for overseeing the entire police force and law enforcement activities within their respective jurisdiction. This position holds significant authority and plays a crucial role in maintaining law and order, implementing crime prevention strategies, and ensuring public safety. The DGP is usually appointed by the state government and works closely with other law enforcement agencies and government officials to uphold the rule of law and protect citizens' rights. [1] [2]
Appointment of Director General of Police
[ edit ]
The appointment of the Director General of Police (Head of Police Force) in Indian states and union territories follows a structured process mandated by the Supreme Court of India , primarily based on the directives issued in the landmark Prakash Singh case of 2006. These directives aim to ensure transparency, meritocracy, and stability in the leadership of state police forces. [3] [4] The Director General of Police is designated as the head of the police department for all administrative and operational purposes.
Supreme Court Directives
[ edit ]
In the Prakash Singh case, the Supreme Court issued several directives to reform the police appointment process, emphasizing the need for a transparent and merit-based selection system. [3] Key aspects of these directives include:
Consultation with UPSC: State governments are required to consult the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) before appointing a DGP. This consultation involves sending the names of eligible officers to the UPSC at least three months before the incumbent DGP's retirement. [5]
Preparation of Panel: The UPSC prepares a panel of three officers deemed fit for the DGP position based on seniority, service record, and range of experience. This panel is then sent back to the state government, which is required to appoint one of the shortlisted officers as the DGP. [6]
Minimum Tenure: The selected DGP is mandated to have a minimum tenure of at least two years, irrespective of their date of superannuation. This provision aims to provide stability and continuity in police leadership. [5]
Eligibility Criteria: Only officers with a minimum of 30 years of service and holding the rank of Additional Director General (ADG) or equivalent are considered for the DGP position. Additionally, officers must have at least six months of service left before retirement at the time of their empanelment. [6]
No Acting DGPs: The Supreme Court has explicitly rejected the practice of appointing ""Acting DGPs,"" requiring states to appoint a permanent DGP to ensure stable leadership. [5]
Other appointments
[ edit ]
When a state or union territory (UT) cadre has more than one director general (DG)-ranked officer, one of them is appointed as the Director General of Police (DGP), who serves as the head of the police force (HoPF). The remaining DG-ranked officers in a state or UT may be appointed to various positions outside of the police department, such as Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services, Director General of Fire and Rescue Services, Director General of the Anti-Corruption Bureau, Traffic and Road Safety Commissioner, Excise Commissioner, or heads of state public sector undertakings. Alternatively, they may be appointed to commensurate positions in various central police organizations or agencies under the Union government. [7]
Salary
[ edit ]
The pay matrix for Director General of Police (DGP) ranked officers comprises Pay Level 17, the apex grade, and Pay Level 16. The Head of Police Force or State Police Chief, holding the rank of DGP, receives a monthly fixed salary of ₹225,000, excluding allowances. This salary scale is also applicable to Directors General (DGs) of some Central Police Organisations at the Union government level. [8] [9]
For other DG ranked officers within state governments eligible for Pay Level 16, including DG of Prisons, DG of Fire and Rescue, DG of Civil Defence and Home Guards, DG of Anti-Corruption Bureau, or equivalent posts, the monthly pay ranges from ₹205,400 to ₹224,400, exclusive of allowances. [8]
In November 2022, the government approved a proposal to grant apex scale salary to the Directors of Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), ensuring they receive salaries at par with Secretary-rank Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers, irrespective of seniority. [10]
Insignia and Uniform
[ edit ]
DGP-ranked officers wear Gorget patches on their collars, which feature a dark blue background with an oak leaf pattern stitched on it, similar to those worn by Additional Directors General (ADGs) and Inspectors General (IGs). [11] [12] The insignia and uniform are the same as those of the DGP for both Special DGPs and Additional DGPs.

The cinema of India, consisting of motion pictures made by the Indian film industry , has had a large effect on world cinema since the second half of the 20th century. [8] [9] Indian cinema is made up of various film industries , each focused on producing films in a specific language, such as Hindi , Telugu , Tamil , Kannada , Malayalam , Marathi , Bengali , Punjabi , Bhojpuri , Assamese and others.
Major centres of film production across the country include Mumbai , Hyderabad , Chennai , Kolkata , Thiruvananthapuram , Bengaluru , Bhubaneswar - Cuttack , and Guwahati . [details 1] For a number of years, the Indian film industry has ranked first in the world in terms of annual film output. [29] In 2022, Indian cinema earned ₹ 15,000 crore ($1.9 billion) at the box-office. [5] Ramoji Film City located in Hyderabad is certified by the Guinness World Records as the largest film studio complex in the world measuring over 1,666 acres (674 ha ). [30]
Indian cinema is composed of multilingual and multi-ethnic film art. The term ' Bollywood ', often mistakenly used to refer to Indian cinema as a whole, specifically denotes the Hindi-language film industry. Indian cinema, however, is an umbrella term encompassing multiple film industries, each producing films in its respective language and showcasing unique cultural and stylistic elements.
In 2021, Telugu cinema emerged as the largest film industry in India in terms of box office. [31] [32] In 2022, Hindi cinema represented 33% of box office revenue, followed by Telugu representing 20%, Tamil representing 16%, Kannada representing 8%, and Malayalam representing 6%. [33] [34] Other prominent film industries are Marathi , Punjabi , Bengali , Gujarati , Bhojpuri , and Odia cinema . [33] [34] As of 2022, the combined revenue of South Indian film industries has surpassed that of the Mumbai-based Hindi-language film industry (Bollywood). [35] [36] As of 2022, Telugu cinema leads Indian cinema with 23.3 crore (233 million) tickets sold, followed by Tamil cinema with 20.5 crore (205 million) and Hindi cinema with 18.9 crore (189 million). [37] [33]
Indian cinema is a global enterprise, [38] and its films have attracted international attention and acclaim throughout South Asia . [39] Since talkies began in 1931, Hindi cinema has led in terms of box office performance, but in recent years it has faced stiff competition from Telugu cinema. [40] [32] Overseas Indians account for 12% of the industry's revenue. [41]
History
[ edit ]
The history of cinema in India extends to the beginning of the film era. Following the screening of the Lumière and Robert Paul moving pictures in London in 1896, commercial cinematography became a worldwide sensation and these films were shown in Bombay (now Mumbai ) that same year. [42]
Silent era (1890s–1920s)
[ edit ]
In 1897, a film presentation by filmmaker Professor Stevenson featured a stage show at Calcutta's Star Theatre. With Stevenson's camera and encouragement, Indian photographer Hiralal Sen filmed scenes from that show, exhibited as The Flower of Persia (1898). [43] The Wrestlers (1899), by H. S. Bhatavdekar , showing a wrestling match at the Hanging Gardens in Bombay, was the first film to be shot by an Indian and the first Indian documentary film.[ citation needed ] From 1913 to 1931, all the movies made in India were silent films , which had no sound and had intertitles . [44]
History of Indian cinema
In 1913, Dadasaheb Phalke released Raja Harishchandra (1913) in Bombay, the first film made in India. It was a silent film incorporating English , Marathi , and Hindi intertitles . [49] It was premiered in Coronation cinema in Girgaon . [50]
Although some claim Shree Pundalik (1912) of Dadasaheb Torne as the first film ever made in India, [51] [52] [50] some film scholars have argued that Pundalik was not a true Indian film because it was simply a recording of a stage play, filmed by a British cameraman and it was processed in London. [53] [54] [49] Raja Harishchandra of Phalke had a story based on Hindu Sanskrit legend of Harishchandra , a truthful King and its success led many to consider him a pioneer of Indian cinema. [50] Phalke used an all Indian crew including actors Anna Salunke and D. D. Dabke . He directed, edited, processed the film himself. [49] Phalke saw The Life of Christ (1906) by the French director Alice Guy-Blaché , While watching Jesus on the screen, Phalke envisioned Hindu deities Rama and Krishna instead and decided to start in the business of ""moving pictures"". [55]
In South India , film pioneer Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu , credited as the father of Telugu cinema , built the first cinemas in Madras (now Chennai ), and a film studio was established in the city by Nataraja Mudaliar. [56] [57] [58] In 1921, Naidu produced the silent film, Bhishma Pratigna , generally considered to be the first Telugu feature film . [59]
The first Tamil and Malayalam films , also silent films, were Keechaka Vadham (1917–1918, R. Nataraja Mudaliar ) [60] and Vigathakumaran (1928, J. C. Daniel Nadar ). The latter was the first Indian social drama film and featured the first Dalit -caste film actress.[ citation needed ]
The first chain of Indian cinemas, Madan Theatre , was owned by Parsi entrepreneur Jamshedji Framji Madan , who oversaw the production and distribution of films for the chain. [50] These included film adaptations from Bengal's popular literature and Satyawadi Raja Harishchandra (1917), a remake of Phalke's influential film.[ citation needed ]
Films steadily gained popularity across India as affordable entertainment for the masses (admission as low as an anna [one-sixteenth of a rupee] in Bombay). [42] Young producers began to incorporate elements of Indian social life and culture into cinema, others brought new ideas from across the world. Global audiences and markets soon became aware of India's film industry. [61]
In 1927, the British government, to promote the market in India for British films over American ones, formed the Indian Cinematograph Enquiry Committee . The ICC consisted of three British and three Indians, led by T. Rangachari , a Madras lawyer. [62] This committee failed to bolster the desired recommendations of supporting British Film, instead recommending support for the fledgling Indian film industry, and their suggestions were set aside.
Sound era
The first Indian sound film was Alam Ara (1931) made by Ardeshir Irani . [50] Ayodhyecha Raja (1932) was the first sound film of Marathi cinema . [44] Irani also produced South India's first sound film, the Tamil–Telugu bilingual talking picture Kalidas (1931, H. M. Reddy ). [63]
The first Telugu film with audible dialogue, Bhakta Prahlada (1932), was directed by H. M. Reddy , who directed the first bilingual (Telugu and Tamil) talkie Kalidas (1931). [64] East India Film Company produced its first Telugu film, Savitri (1933, C. Pullayya ), adapted from a stage play by Mylavaram Bala Bharathi Samajam. [65] The film received an honorary diploma at the 2nd Venice International Film Festival . [66] Chittoor Nagayya was one of the first multilingual filmmakers in India. [67] [68]
Jumai Shasthi was the first Bengali short film as a talkie . [69]
Jyoti Prasad Agarwala made his first film Joymoti (1935) in Assamese, and later made Indramalati .[ citation needed ] The first film studio in South India, Durga Cinetone, was built in 1936 by Nidamarthi Surayya in Rajahmundry , Andhra Pradesh. [70] [ contradictory ] The advent of sound to Indian cinema launched musicals such as Indra Sabha and Devi Devyani, marking the beginning of song-and-dance in Indian films. [50] By 1935, studios emerged in major cities such as Madras, Calcutta and Bombay as filmmaking became an established industry, exemplified by the success of Devdas (1935). [71] The first colour film made in India was Kisan Kanya (1937, Moti B). [72] Viswa Mohini (1940) was the first Indian film to depict the Indian movie-making world. [73]
Swamikannu Vincent , who had built the first cinema of South India in Coimbatore , introduced the concept of ""tent cinema"" in which a tent was erected on a stretch of open land to screen films. The first of its kind was in Madras and called Edison's Grand Cinema Megaphone. This was due to the fact that electric carbons were used for motion picture projectors. [74] [ further explanation needed ] Bombay Talkies opened in 1934 and Prabhat Studios in Pune began production of Marathi films. [71] Sant Tukaram (1936) was the first Indian film to be screened at an international film festival,[ contradictory ] at the 1937 edition of the Venice Film Festival. The film was judged one of the three best films of the year. [75] However, while Indian filmmakers sought to tell important stories, the British Raj banned Wrath (1930) and Raithu Bidda (1938) for broaching the subject of the Indian independence movement . [50] [76] [77]
The Indian Masala film —a term used for mixed-genre films that combined song, dance, romance, etc.—arose following the Second World War. [71] During the 1940s, cinema in South India accounted for nearly half of India's cinema halls, and cinema came to be viewed as an instrument of cultural revival. [71] The Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), an art movement with a communist inclination, began to take shape through the 1940s and the 1950s. [78] IPTA plays, such as Nabanna (1944), prepared the ground for realism in Indian cinema, exemplified by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas 's Dharti Ke Lal (Children of the Earth, 1946). [78] The IPTA movement continued to emphasise realism in films Mother India (1957) and Pyaasa (1957), among India's most recognisable cinematic productions. [79]
Following independence, the 1947 partition of India divided the nation's assets and a number of studios moved to Pakistan. [71] Partition became an enduring film subject thereafter. [71] The Indian government had established a Films Division by 1948, which eventually became one of the world's largest documentary film producers with an annual production of over 200 short documentaries, each released in 18 languages with 9,000 prints for permanent film theatres across the country. [80]
Golden Age (late 1940s–1960s)
[ edit ]
Satyajit Ray is recognised as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century. [81] [82] [83]
The period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s is regarded by film historians as the Golden Age of Indian cinema. [84] [85] [86] This period saw the emergence of the parallel cinema movement, which emphasised social realism . Mainly led by Bengalis, [87] early examples include Dharti Ke Lal (1946, Khwaja Ahmad Abbas ), [88] Neecha Nagar (1946, Chetan Anand ), [89] Nagarik (1952, Ritwik Ghatak ) [90] [91] and Do Bigha Zamin (1953, Bimal Roy), laying the foundations for Indian neorealism [92]
The Apu Trilogy (1955–1959, Satyajit Ray ) won prizes at several major international film festivals and firmly established the parallel cinema movement. [93] It was influential on world cinema and led to a rush of coming-of-age films in art house theatres. [94] Cinematographer Subrata Mitra developed the technique of bounce lighting , to recreate the effect of daylight on sets, during the second film of the trilogy [95] and later pioneered other effects such as the photo-negative flashbacks and X-ray digressions. [96]
During the 1950s, Indian cinema reportedly became the world's second largest film industry, earning a gross annual income of ₹250 million (equivalent to ₹26 billion or US$310 million in 2023) in 1953. [97] The government created the Film Finance Corporation (FFC) in 1960 to provide financial support to filmmakers. [98] While serving as Information and Broadcasting Minister of India in the 1960s, Indira Gandhi supported the production of off-beat cinema through the FFC. [98]
Baburao Patel of Filmindia called B. N. Reddy 's Malliswari (1951) an ""inspiring motion picture"" which would ""save us the blush when compared with the best of motion pictures of the world"". [99] Film historian Randor Guy called Malliswari scripted by Devulapalli Krishnasastri a ""poem in celluloid, told with rare artistic finesse, which lingers long in the memory"". [100]
Commercial Hindi cinema began thriving, including acclaimed films Pyaasa (1957) and Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959, Guru Dutt ) Awaara (1951) and Shree 420 (1955, Raj Kapoor ). These films expressed social themes mainly dealing with working-class urban life in India; Awaara presented Bombay as both a nightmare and a dream, while Pyaasa critiqued the unreality of city life. [87]
Actor Dilip Kumar rose to fame in the 1950s, and was the biggest Indian movie star of the time. [107] [108] He was a pioneer of method acting , predating Hollywood method actors such as Marlon Brando . Much like Brando's influence on New Hollywood actors, Kumar inspired Hindi actors, including Amitabh Bachchan , Naseeruddin Shah , Shah Rukh Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui . [109]
Neecha Nagar (1946) won the Palme d'Or at Cannes [89] and Indian films competed for the award most years in the 1950s and early 1960s.[ citation needed ] Ray is regarded as one of the greatest auteurs of 20th century cinema , [110] along with his contemporaries Dutt [111] and Ghatak. [112] In 1992, the Sight & Sound Critics' Poll ranked Ray at No. 7 in its list of Top 10 Directors of all time. [113] Multiple films from this era are included among the greatest films of all time in various critics' and directors' polls, including The Apu Trilogy, [114] Jalsaghar , Charulata [115] Aranyer Din Ratri , [116] Pyaasa, Kaagaz Ke Phool, Meghe Dhaka Tara , Komal Gandhar, Awaara, Baiju Bawra , Mother India, Mughal-e-Azam [117] and Subarnarekha (also tied at No. 11). [112]
Sivaji Ganesan became India's first actor to receive an international award when he won the Best Actor award at the Afro-Asian film festival in 1960 and was awarded the title of Chevalier in the Legion of Honour by the French Government in 1995. [118] Tamil cinema is influenced by Dravidian politics , [119] with prominent film personalities C N Annadurai , M G Ramachandran , M Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa becoming Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu . [120] [ timeframe? ]
1970s–present
By 1986, India's annual film output had increased to 833 films annually, making India the world's largest film producer. [121] Hindi film production of Bombay, the largest segment of the industry, became known as ""Bollywood"".
Summary of the 2022 box office revenues.
Hindi (33%)
Malayalam (6%)
Other (17%)
By 1996, the Indian film industry had an estimated domestic cinema viewership of 600 million people, establishing India as one of the largest film markets, with the largest regional industries being Hindi, Telugu, and Tamil films. [122] In 2001, in terms of ticket sales, Indian cinema sold an estimated 3.6 billion tickets annually across the globe, compared to Hollywood 's 2.6 billion tickets sold. [123] [124]
Hindi
[ edit ]
Realistic parallel cinema continued throughout the 1970s, [125] practised in many Indian film cultures. The FFC's art film orientation came under criticism during a Committee on Public Undertakings investigation in 1976, which accused the body of not doing enough to encourage commercial cinema. [126]
The screenwriting duo Salim–Javed , consisting of Salim Khan (l) and Javed Akhtar (r), revitalised Indian cinema in the 1970s [127] and are considered Bollywood 's greatest screenwriters . [128]
By the early 1970s, Hindi cinema was experiencing thematic stagnation, [129] dominated by musical romance films . [130] Screenwriter duo Salim–Javed ( Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar ) revitalised the industry. [129] They established the genre of gritty, violent, Bombay underworld crime films with Zanjeer (1973) and Deewaar (1975). [131] [132] They reinterpreted the rural themes of Mother India and Gunga Jumna in an urban context reflecting 1970s India, [129] [133] channelling the growing discontent and disillusionment among the masses, [129] unprecedented growth of slums [134] and urban poverty, corruption and crime, [135] as well as anti-establishment themes. [136] This resulted in their creation of the ""angry young man"", personified by Amitabh Bachchan , [136] who reinterpreted Kumar's performance in Gunga Jumna [129] [133] and gave a voice to the urban poor. [134]
By the mid-1970s, Bachchan's position as a lead actor was solidified by crime-action films Zanjeer and Sholay (1975). [126] The devotional classic Jai Santoshi Ma (1975) was made on a low budget and became a box office success and a cult classic. [126] Another important film was Deewaar (1975, Yash Chopra ), [105] a crime film with brothers on opposite sides of the law which Danny Boyle described as ""absolutely key to Indian cinema"". [137]
The term "" Bollywood "" was coined in the 1970s, [138] [139] when the conventions of commercial Bombay-produced Hindi films were established. [140] Key to this was Nasir Hussain and Salim–Javed's creation of the masala film genre, which combines elements of action , comedy , romance , drama , melodrama and musical . [140] [141] Their film Yaadon Ki Baarat (1973) has been identified as the first masala film and the first quintessentially Bollywood film. [140] [142] Masala films made Bachchan the biggest Bollywood movie star of the period. Another landmark was Amar Akbar Anthony (1977, Manmohan Desai ). [142] [143] Desai further expanded the genre in the 1970s and 1980s.
Commercial Hindi cinema grew in the 1980s, with films such as Ek Duuje Ke Liye (1981), Disco Dancer (1982), Himmatwala (1983), Tohfa (1984), Naam (1986), Mr India (1987), and Tezaab (1988).
In the late 1980s,[ timeframe? ] Hindi cinema experienced another period of stagnation, with a decline in box office turnout, due to increasing violence, decline in musical melodic quality, and rise in video piracy, leading to middle-class family audiences abandoning theatres. The turning point came with Indian blockbuster Disco Dancer (1982) which began the era of disco music in Indian cinema. Lead actor Mithun Chakraborty and music director Bappi Lahiri had the highest number of mainstream Indian hit movies that decade. At the end of the decade, Yash Chopra 's Chandni (1989) created a new formula for Bollywood musical romance films, reviving the genre and defining Hindi cinema in the years that followed. [144] [145] Commercial Hindi cinema grew in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the release of Mr. India (1987), Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988), Chaalbaaz (1989), Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), Lamhe (1991), Saajan (1991), Khuda Gawah (1992), Khalnayak (1993), Darr (1993), [126] Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Pyar Kiya Toh Darna Kya (1998) and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998). Cult classic Bandit Queen (1994) directed by Shekhar Kapur received international recognition and controversy. [146] [147]
Sridevi (2012) was regarded as the most popular female star in Indian cinema. [148]
In the late 1990s, there was a resurgence of parallel cinema in Bollywood, largely due to the critical and commercial success of crime films such as Satya (1998) and Vaastav (1999). These films launched a genre known as ""Mumbai noir"", [149] reflecting social problems in the city. [150] Ram Gopal Varma directed the Indian Political Trilogy , and the Indian Gangster Trilogy ; film critic Rajeev Masand had labelled the latter series as one of the ""most influential movies of Bollywood. [151] [152] [153] The first instalment of the trilogy, Satya , was also listed in CNN-IBN 's 100 greatest Indian films of all time. [154]
Since the 1990s, the three biggest Bollywood movie stars have been the "" Three Khans "": Aamir Khan , Shah Rukh Khan , and Salman Khan . [155] [156] Combined, they starred in the top ten highest-grossing Bollywood films , [155] and have dominated the Indian box office since the 1990s. [157] [158] Shah Rukh Khan was the most successful for most of the 1990s and 2000s, while Aamir Khan has been the most successful since the late 2000s; [159] according to Forbes , Shah Rukh Khan is ""arguably the world's biggest movie star"" as of 2017, due to his immense popularity in India and China. [160] Other notable Hindi film stars of recent decades include Arjun Rampal , Sunny Deol , Akshay Kumar , Ajay Devgn , Hrithik Roshan , Anil Kapoor , Sanjay Dutt , Sridevi , Madhuri Dixit , Juhi Chawla , Karisma Kapoor , Kajol , Tabu , Aishwarya Rai , Rani Mukerji and Preity Zinta .
Haider (2014, Vishal Bhardwaj ), the third instalment of the Indian Shakespearean Trilogy after Maqbool (2003) and Omkara (2006), [161] won the People's Choice Award at the 9th Rome Film Festival in the Mondo Genere making it the first Indian film to achieve this honour. [162] [ relevant? ]
The 2000s and 2010s also saw the rise of a new generation of popular actors like Shahid Kapoor , Ranbir Kapoor , Ranveer Singh , Ayushmann Khurrana , Varun Dhawan , Sidharth Malhotra , Sushant Singh Rajput , Kartik Aaryan , Arjun Kapoor , Aditya Roy Kapur and Tiger Shroff , as well as actresses like Vidya Balan , Priyanka Chopra , Kareena Kapoor , Katrina Kaif , Kangana Ranaut , Deepika Padukone , Sonam Kapoor , Anushka Sharma , Shraddha Kapoor , Alia Bhatt , Parineeti Chopra and Kriti Sanon with Balan, Ranaut and Bhatt gaining wide recognition for successful female-centric films such as The Dirty Picture (2011), Kahaani (2012), Queen (2014), Highway (2014), Tanu Weds Manu Returns (2015), Raazi (2018) and Gangubai Kathiawadi (2022).
Salim–Javed were highly influential in South Indian cinema . In addition to writing two Kannada films , many of their Bollywood films had remakes produced in other regions, including Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam cinema. While the Bollywood directors and producers held the rights to their films in Northern India, Salim–Javed retained the rights in South India, where they sold remake rights for films such as Zanjeer, Yaadon Ki Baarat and Don. [163] Several of these remakes became breakthroughs for actor Rajinikanth . [130] [164]
Sridevi is widely regarded as the first female superstar of Indian cinema due to her pan-Indian appeal with equally successful careers in Hindi , Tamil , Malayalam , Kannada and Telugu cinema . She is the only Bollywood actor to have starred in a top 10 grossing film each year of her active career (1983–1997).[ citation needed ]
Telugu
[ edit ]
K. V. Reddy 's Mayabazar (1957) is a landmark film in Indian cinema, a classic of Telugu cinema that inspired generations of filmmakers. It blends myth, fantasy, romance and humour in a timeless story, captivating audiences with its fantastical elements. The film excelled in various departments like cast performances, production design, music, cinematography and is particularly revered for its use of technology. [165] [166] The use of special effects, innovative for the 1950s, like the first illusion of moonlight, showcased technical brilliance.. Powerful performances and relatable themes ensure Mayabazar stays relevant, a classic enjoyed by new generations. On the centenary of Indian cinema in 2013, CNN-IBN included Mayabazar in its list of ""100 greatest Indian films of all time"". [167] In a poll conducted by CNN-IBN among those 100 films, Mayabazar was voted by the public as the ""Greatest Indian film of all time"". [168]
K. Viswanath , one of the prominent auteurs of Indian cinema, he received international recognition for his works, and is known for blending parallel cinema with mainstream cinema. His works such as Sankarabharanam (1980) about revitalisation of Indian classical music won the ""Prize of the Public"" at the Besançon Film Festival of France in the year 1981. [169] Forbes included J. V. Somayajulu 's performance in the film on its list of ""25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema"". [170] Swathi Muthyam (1986) was India's official entry to the 59th Academy Awards . [169] Swarna Kamalam (1988) the dance film choreographed by Kelucharan Mohapatra , and Sharon Lowen was featured at the Ann Arbor Film Festival , fetching three Indian Express Awards . [171] [172]
B. Narsing Rao , K. N. T. Sastry , and A. Kutumba Rao garnered international recognition for their works in new-wave cinema. [173] [174] Narsing Rao's Maa Ooru (1992) won the "" Media Wave Award "" of Hungary; Daasi (1988) and Matti Manushulu (1990) won the Diploma of Merit awards at the 16th and 17th MIFF respectively. [175] [176] Sastry's Thilaadanam (2000) received ""New Currents Award"" at the 7th Busan ; [177] [178] Rajnesh Domalpalli's Vanaja (2006) won ""Best First Feature Award"" at the 57th Berlinale . [179] [180]
Ram Gopal Varma 's Siva (1989), which attained cult following [181] introduced steadicams and new sound recording techniques to Indian films. [182] Siva attracted the young audience during its theatrical run, and its success encouraged filmmakers to explore a variety of themes and make experimental films. [183] Varma introduced road movie and film noir to Indian screen with Kshana Kshanam (1991). [184] Varma experimented with close-to-life performances by the lead actors, which bought a rather fictional storyline a sense of authenticity at a time when the industry was being filled with commercial fillers. [185]
Singeetam Srinivasa Rao introduced time travel to the Indian screen with Aditya 369 (1991). The film dealt with exploratory dystopian and apocalyptic themes, taking the audience through a post-apocalyptic experience via time travel and folklore from 1526 CE, including a romantic subplot. [186] Singeetam Srinivasa Rao was inspired by the classic sci-fi novel The Time Machine . [187] [188] [189]
Chiranjeevi 's works such as the social drama film Swayamkrushi (1987), comedy thriller Chantabbai (1986), the vigilante thriller Kondaveeti Donga (1990), [190] the Western thriller Kodama Simham (1990), and the action thriller , Gang Leader (1991), popularised genre films with the highest estimated cinema footfalls. [191] Sekhar Kammula 's Dollar Dreams (2000), which explored the conflict between American dreams and human feelings, re-introduced social realism to Telugu film which had stagnated in formulaic commercialism. [192] War drama Kanche (2015, Krish Jagarlamudi ) explored the 1944 Nazi attack on the Indian army in the Italian campaign of the Second World War. [193]
S.S Rajamouli has been described as ""the biggest Indian film director ever"" and ""India's most significant director today"". [194] [195]
Pan-Indian film is a term related to Indian cinema that originated with Telugu cinema as a mainstream commercial film appealing to audiences across the country with a spread to world markets. [196] S. S. Rajamouli pioneered the pan-Indian films movement with duology of epic action films Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017), that changed the face of Indian cinema. Baahubali: The Beginning became the first Indian film to be nominated for American Saturn Awards . [197] It received national and international acclaim for Rajamouli's direction, story, visual effects, cinematography, themes, action sequences, music, and performances, and became a record-breaking box office success. [198] The sequel Baahubali 2 (2017) went on to win the American "" Saturn Award for Best International Film "" & emerged as the second-highest-grossing Indian film of all time. [199] [200]
S.S Rajamouli followed up with the alternate historical film RRR (2022) that received universal critical acclaim for its direction, screenwriting, cast performances, cinematography, soundtrack, action sequences and VFX , which further consolidated the Pan-Indian film market. The film was considered one of the ten best films of the year by the National Board of Review , making it only the seventh non-English language film ever to make it to the list. [201] It also became the first Indian film by an Indian production to win an Academy Award . [202] The film went on to receive several other nominations at the Golden Globe Awards , Critics' Choice Movie Award including Best Foreign Language Film . [203] Films like Pushpa: The Rise , Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire and Kalki 2898 AD have further contributed to the pan-Indian film wave.
Actors like Prabhas , Allu Arjun , Ram Charan and N. T. Rama Rao Jr. enjoy a nationwide popularity among the audiences after the release of their respective Pan-Indian films. Film critics , journalists and analysts, such as Baradwaj Rangan and Vishal Menon, have labelled Prabhas as the ""first legit Pan-Indian Superstar"". [204]
Hindi cinema has been remaking Telugu films since the late 1940s, some of which went on to become landmark films. Between 2000 and 2019, one in every three successful films made in Hindi was either a remake or part of a series. And most of the star actors, have starred in the hit remakes of Telugu films. [205]
Tamil
[ edit ]
Tamil cinema established Madras (now Chennai ) as a secondary film production centre in India, used by Hindi cinema , other South Indian film industries, and Sri Lankan cinema . [206] Over the last quarter of the 20th century, Tamil films from India established a global presence through distribution to an increasing number of overseas theatres. [207] [208] The industry also inspired independent filmmaking in Sri Lanka and Tamil diaspora populations in Malaysia, Singapore, and the Western Hemisphere . [209]
From left to right: Mani Ratnam (film director), Kamal Hasan and Rajinikanth
Marupakkam (1991, K. S. Sethumadhavan ) and Kanchivaram (2007) each won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film . [210] Tamil films receive significant patronage in neighbouring Indian states Kerala , Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , Maharashtra , Gujarat and New Delhi. In Kerala and Karnataka the films are directly released in Tamil but in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana they are generally dubbed into Telugu. [211] [212]
Tamil films have had international success for decades. Since Chandralekha (1948), Muthu (1995) was the second Tamil film to be dubbed into Japanese (as Mutu: Odoru Maharaja [213] ) and grossed a record $1.6 million in 1998. [214] In 2010, Enthiran grossed a record $4 million in North America. [215] Tamil-language films appeared at multiple film festivals.

Nayakan (1987, Kamal Haasan ) was included in Time's All-Time 100 Movies list. [217]
Malayalam
Adoor Gopalakrishnan
Malayalam cinema experienced its Golden Age during this time with works of filmmakers such as Adoor Gopalakrishnan , G. Aravindan , T. V. Chandran and Shaji N. Karun . [218] Gopalakrishnan is often considered to be Ray's spiritual heir. [219] He directed some of his most acclaimed films during this period, including Elippathayam (1981) which won the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film Festival .[ citation needed ] In 1984 My Dear Kuttichathan , directed by Jijo Punnoose under Navodaya Studio , was released and it was the first Indian film to be filmed in 3D format.

Namaste - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Customary Hindu greeting
For the Better Call Saul episode, see Namaste (Better Call Saul) .
Pressing hands together with a smile to greet namaste – a common cultural gesture in India
Namaste (
Sanskrit pronunciation: [nɐmɐste:] , [1] Devanagari : नमस्ते), sometimes called namaskār and namaskāram, is a customary Hindu [2] [3] [4] manner of respectfully greeting and honouring a person or group, used at any time of day. [5] It is used worldwide among the Hindu, Buddhist and Jain traditions. Namaste is usually spoken with a slight bow and hands pressed together, palms touching and fingers pointing upwards, thumbs close to the chest. This gesture is called añjali mudrā; the standing posture incorporating it is pranāmāsana. [6]
Etymology, meaning and origins
[ edit ]
Left: Hindu god Kubera on the left with a person in Namaste pose (13th century Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura , Karnataka, India ). Namaste or Añjali Mudrā are common in historic Hindu temple reliefs.Right: Entrance pillar relief ( Thrichittatt Maha Vishnu Temple , Kerala , India).
Namaste (Namas + te) is derived from Sanskrit and is a combination of the word namas and the second person dative pronoun in its enclitic form, te . [7] The word namaḥ takes the sandhi form namas before the sound te. [8] [9]
It is found in the Vedic literature. Namas-krita and related terms appear in the Hindu scripture Rigveda such as in the Vivaha Sukta, verse 10.85.22 [10] in the sense of ""worship, adore"", while Namaskara appears in the sense of ""exclamatory adoration, homage, salutation and worship"" in the Atharvaveda , the Taittiriya Samhita, and the Aitareya Brahmana. It is an expression of veneration, worship, reverence, an ""offering of homage"" and ""adoration"" in the Vedic literature and post-Vedic texts such as the Mahabharata. [11] [12] The phrase Namas-te appears with this meaning in Rigveda 8.75.10, [13] Atharvaveda verse 6.13.2, Taittirya Samhita 2.6.11.2 and in numerous other instances in many early Hindu texts. [14] It is also found in numerous ancient and medieval era sculpture and mandapa relief artwork in Hindu temples . [15]
World leaders adopting Namaste during COVID-19 .
According to the Indologist Stephen Phillips, the terms ""te and tvam"" are an informal, familiar form of ""you"" in Sanskrit, and it is typically not used for unfamiliar adults. It is reserved for someone familiar, intimate, divine or a child. [16] [17] By using the dative form of tvam in the greeting Namas-te, there is an embedded secondary, metaphorical sense in the word. This is the basis of the pragmatic meaning of Namas-te, that is ""salutations to the (divine) child (in your heart)"", states Phillips. [16]
In the contemporary era, namaḥ means 'bow', 'obeisance', 'reverential salutation' or 'adoration' [18] and te means 'to you' (singular dative case of 'tvam'). Therefore, namaste literally means ""bowing to you"". [19] In Hinduism , it also has a spiritual import reflecting the belief that ""the divine and self ( atman , Self) is same in you and me"", and connotes ""I bow to the divine in you"". [20] [5] [21] According to sociologist Holly Oxhandler, it is a Hindu term which means ""the sacred in me recognizes the sacred in you"". [22]
A less common variant is used in the case of three or more people being addressed namely Namo vaḥ which is a combination of namaḥ and the enclitic second person plural pronoun vaḥ. [7] The word namaḥ takes the sandhi form namo before the sound v. [8] An even less common variant is used in the case of two people being addressed, namely, Namo vām, which is a combination of namaḥ and the enclitic second person dual pronoun vām. [7]
History
[ edit ]
Excavations at various Indus Valley Civilisation have revealed some male and female terracotta figures in namaste posture. [23] [24] These archaeological findings are dated to the Mature Harappan . [25] [26]

Anjali Mudra
[ edit ]
The gesture of folding hands during a namaste is called the Añjali Mudrā . [27] In addition to namaste, this mudra is one of the postures found in Indian classical dance such as Bharatanatyam , [28] and in yoga practice. [29] It is widely found in Indian temple reliefs and sculpture in mandapam, at entrances and iconography such as the Lingobhavamurti of Shaivism . [30] [31] The Anjali mudra differs from namaste by being a non-verbal gesture, while namaste can be said with or without any gesture. According to Bhaumik and Govil, the Anjali mudra and Namaskara mudra are very similar but have a subtle difference. The back of the thumbs in Anjali mudra face the chest and are perpendicular to other fingers, while the thumbs in Namaskara mudra are aligned with the other fingers. [32]
Anjali mudra is described in Sanskrit texts such as in verse 9.127–128 of the Natya Shastra (200 BCE – 200 CE), in temple architecture texts dated after the sixth-century CE such as in verse 5.67 of the Devata murti prakarana and those on painting called the Citrasutras. The Natya Shastra, a classical Indian dance text, describes it to be a posture where the two hands are folded together in a reverential state and that this is used to pray before a deity, receive any person one reveres and also to greet friends. The Natya Shastra further states that for prayers inside a temple, the Anjali mudra should be placed near one's head or above, while meeting someone venerable it is placed in front of one's face or chin, and for friends near one's chest. [33] [34]
Uses
[ edit ]
The gesture is widely used throughout the Indian subcontinent, parts of Asia and beyond where people of South and Southeast Asian origins have migrated. [20] Namaste is used as a respectful form of greeting, acknowledging and welcoming a relative, guest or stranger. [35] In some contexts, namaste is used by one person to express gratitude for assistance offered or given, and to thank the other person for his or her generous kindness. [36]
Namaskara is one of the 16 upacharas (veneration practices) used inside temples or any place of formal puja (worship). [37] Namaste in the context of deity worship, scholars conclude, [38] [39] has the same function as in greeting a guest or anyone else. It expresses politeness, courtesy, honor, and hospitality from one person to the other. It is used in goodbyes as well.  This is sometimes expressed, in ancient Hindu scriptures such as Taittiriya Upanishad , as Atithi Devo Bhava (literally, treat the guest like a god). [40] [41]
Namaste is one of the six forms of pranama , and in parts of India these terms are used synonymously. [42] [43]
Since namaste is a non-contact form of greeting, some world leaders adopted the gesture as an alternative to hand shaking during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic as a means to prevent the spread of the virus. [44] [45]

Chand Baori , in the village of Abhaneri near Bandikui , Rajasthan is one of the deepest and largest stepwells in India
The Rani ki Vav , Patan, Gujarat
A multi-storey stepwell in Mahimapur Village, Amravati District, Maharashtra
Stepwells (also known as vavs or baori) are wells , cisterns or ponds with a long corridor of steps that descend to the water level. Stepwells played a significant role in defining subterranean architecture in western India from the 7th to the 19th century. [1] Some stepwells are multi-storeyed and can be accessed by a Persian wheel which is pulled by a bull to bring water to the first or second floor. They are most common in western India and are also found in the other more arid regions of the Indian subcontinent , extending into Pakistan . The construction of stepwells is mainly utilitarian , though they may include embellishments of architectural significance, and be temple tanks .
Stepwells are examples of the many types of storage and irrigation tanks that were developed in India, mainly to cope with seasonal fluctuations in water availability. A basic difference between stepwells on one hand, and tanks and wells on the other, is that stepwells make it easier for people to reach the groundwater and to maintain and manage the well.
Basic architecture
[ edit ]
Plan of Dada Harir Stepwell in  Gujarat, India
The builders dug deep trenches into the earth for dependable, year-round groundwater. They lined the walls of these trenches with blocks of stone, without mortar , and created stairs leading down to the water. [2] This led to the building of some significant ornamental and architectural features, often associated with dwellings in urban areas. It also ensured their survival as monuments.
A stepwell structure consists of two sections: a vertical shaft from which water is drawn and the surrounding inclined subterranean passageways and the chambers and steps which provide access to the well. The galleries and chambers surrounding these wells were often carved profusely with elaborate detail and became cool, quiet retreats during the hot summers. [3]
Names
[ edit ]
A number of distinct names, sometimes local, exist for stepwells. In Hindi -speaking regions, they include names based on baudi (including bawdi ( Rajasthani : बावड़ी), bawri, bawari, baori, baoli, bavadi and bavdi). In Gujarati and Marwari language , they are usually called vav, vavri or vaav ( Gujarati : વાવ). Other names include kalyani or pushkarani ( Kannada ), baoli ( Hindi : बावली), barav ( Marathi : बारव) and degeenar ( Bhojpuri : 𑂙𑂵𑂏𑂲𑂢𑂰𑂩).
History
Agrasen Ki Baoli in New Delhi , rebuilt in the 14th century
The stepwell may have originated during periods of drought to ensure enough access to the water. The earliest archaeological evidence of stepwells is found at Dholavira where the site also has water tanks or reservoirs with flights of steps. Mohenjo Daro's great bath is also provided with steps on opposite directions. Ashokan inscriptions mention construction of stepwells along major Indian roads at a distance of every 8 kos (about 20.8 miles or 33.5 km) for the convenience of travellers, but Ashoka states that it was a well-established practice which predated him and was done by former kings as well.
King Devanampriya Priyadarsin speaks thus. On the roads banyan-trees were caused to be planted by me, (in order that) they might afford shade to cattle and men, (and) mango-groves were caused to be planted. And (at intervals) of eight kos wells were caused to be dug by me, and flights of steps (for descending into the water) were caused to be built. Numerous drinking-places were caused to be established by me, here and there, for the enjoyment of cattle and men. [But] this so-called enjoyment (is) [of little consequence]. For with various comforts have the people been blessed both by former kings and by myself. But by me this has been done for the following purpose: that they might conform to that practice of morality.
Ashokan Pillar Edict No 7
The first rock-cut stepwells in India date from 200 to 400 AD. [4] The earliest example of a bath-like pond reached by steps is found at Uperkot caves in Junagadh . These caves are dated to the 4th century. Navghan Kuvo, a well with the circular staircase in the vicinity, is another example. It was possibly built in Western Satrap (200–400 AD) or Maitraka (600–700 AD) period, though some place it as late as the 11th century. The nearby Adi Kadi Vav was constructed either in the second half of the 10th century or the 15th century. [5]
The stepwells at Dhank in Rajkot district are dated to 550–625 AD. The stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850–950 AD) are followed by it. [4] The stepwells were constructed in the southwestern region of Gujarat around 600 AD; from there they spread north to Rajasthan and subsequently to the north and west India. Initially used as an art form by Hindus, the construction of these stepwells hit its peak during Muslim rule from the 11th to 16th century. [3]
One of the earliest existing examples of stepwells was built in the 11th century in Gujarat, the Mata Bhavani's Stepwell . A long flight of steps leads to the water below a sequence of multi-story open pavilions positioned along the east–west axis. The elaborate ornamentation of the columns, brackets and beams are a prime example of how stepwells were used as a form of art. [6]
The Mughal emperors did not disrupt the culture that was practiced in these stepwells and encouraged the building of stepwells. The authorities during the British Raj found the hygiene of the stepwells less than desirable and installed pipe and pump systems to replace their purpose. [6]
Location of a stepwell
[ edit ]
A stepwell is generally located in two places - as an extension or part of a temple, and/or the outskirts of a village. [2] When a stepwell is associated with a temple or a shrine, it is either at the opposite wall of it or in front of the temple. Sindhvai Mata stepwell in Patan, Mata Bhavani stepwell in Ahmedabad, and the Ankol Mata stepwell in Davad serve as a great example of the stepwells that house shrines. [2]
Function and use
[ edit ]
The stepwell ensures the availability of water during periods of drought. The stepwells had social, cultural and religious significance. [6] These stepwells were proven to be well-built sturdy structures, after withstanding earthquakes . [2] Most places in India where there is abundant fresh water only during the monsoon season, stepwell and wells play a critical role in serving as a direct means to fresh water filtered through the earth. While the rivers, rivulets , creeks, and other natural water bodies dry up in this climate zone, stepwell and wells remain at a depth where there is less exposure to sun and heat. [2] The majority of surviving stepwells originally served a leisure purpose alongside being main source of water for basic needs like bathing, washing clothes, farming, and watering animals. Stepwells also served as a place for social gatherings and religious ceremonies. Usually, women were more associated with these wells because they were the ones who collected the water. Also, it was they who prayed and offered gifts to the goddess of the well for her blessings. [2]
The well-water is known to attract insects, animals, and many other germ breeding organisms. These stepwells, being a common space in frequent use by the inhabitants of the area, were considered to be a source of spreading epidemics and diseases. [2]
Details
Many stepwells have ornamentation and details as elaborate as those of Hindu temples. Proportions in relationship to the human body were used in their design, as they were in many other structures in Indian architecture. [7]
Stepped ponds
Shravanabelagola stepped pond, Karnataka
Stepped ponds are very similar to stepwells in terms of purpose. Generally, stepped ponds accompany nearby temples while stepwells are more isolated. [8] Stepwells are dark and barely visible from the surface, while stepped ponds are illuminated by the light from the sun. Stepwells are more linear in design compared to the rectangular shape of stepped ponds. [7]
In India
[ edit ]
A number of surviving significant stepwells in India : can be found across India, including in Rajasthan , Gujarat , Delhi , Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra , and North Karnataka ( Karnataka ). In 2016 a collaborative mapping project, Stepwell Atlas, [9] started to map GPS coordinates and collate information on stepwells, mapping over 2800 stepwells in India. Another project mapped the location of over 1700 stepwells in Maharashtra. [10]
Delhi & Haryana :
Stepwells of Delhi & Haryana : In his book Delhi Heritage: Top 10 Baolis, Vikramjit Singh Rooprai mentions that Delhi alone has 32 stepwells. [11] Out of these, 16 are lost, but their locations can be traced. Of the remaining 16, only 14 are accessible to public and the water level in these keeps varying, while two are now permanently dry.

If hyphenated, use {{ hyphen }} to indicate this is intentional (e.g. |page=3{{hyphen}}12), otherwise several editors and semi-automated tools will assume this was a misuse of the parameter to indicate a page range and will convert |page=3-12 to |pages=3{{ndash}}12. Alias: p.
OR: pages: A range of pages in the source that supports the content. Use either |page= or |pages=, but not both. Separate using an en dash (–); separate non-sequential pages with a comma (,); do not use to indicate the total number of pages in the source. Displays preceded by pp. unless |no-pp=yes. Hyphens are automatically converted to en dashes; if hyphens are appropriate because individual page numbers contain hyphens, for example: pp. 3-1–3-15, use double parentheses to tell the template to display the value of |pages= without processing it, and use {{ hyphen }} to indicate to editors that a hyphen is really intended: |pages=((3{{hyphen}}1{{ndash}}3{{hyphen}}15)). Alternatively, use |at=, like this: |at=pp. 3-1&ndash;3-15. Alias: pp.
no-pp: Set to yes, y, or true to suppress the p. or pp. notations where this is inappropriate; for example, where |page=Front cover or |pages= passim .
OR: at: For sources where a page number is inappropriate or insufficient. Overridden by |page= or |pages=. Use only one of |page=, |pages=, or |at=.Examples: page (p.) or pages (pp.); section (sec.), column (col.), paragraph (para.); track; hours, minutes and seconds; act, scene, canto, book, part, folio, stanza, back cover, liner notes, indicia, colophon, dust jacket, verse.
For |quote-page= and |quote-pages= used in conjunction with |quote=, see here .
Identifiers
Not to be confused with § Anchor .
id: A unique identifier , used where none of the specialized identifiers are applicable; wikilink or use an external link template as applicable. For example, |id=NCJ 122967 will append ""NCJ 122967"" at the end of the citation. You can use templates such as |id={{NCJ|122967}} to append NCJ 122967 instead.
The following identifiers create links and are designed to accept a single value. Using multiple values or other text will break the link and/or invalidate the identifier. In general, the parameters should include only the variable part of the identifier, e.g. |rfc=822 or |pmc=345678.
arxiv: arXiv identifier ; for example: |arxiv=hep-th/9205027 (before April 2007) or |arxiv=0706.0001 (April 2007 – December 2014) or |arxiv=1501.00001 (since January 2015). Do not include extraneous file extensions like "".pdf"" or "".html"".  Aliases: eprint.
asin: Amazon Standard Identification Number ; if first character of asin value is a digit, use isbn. Because this link favours one specific distributor, include it only if standard identifiers are not available. Example |asin=B00005N5PF.  Aliases: ASIN.
asin-tld: ASIN top-level domain for Amazon sites other than the US; valid values: ae, au, br, ca, cn, de, es, fr, in, it, jp, mx, nl, pl, sa, se, sg, tr, uk.  Aliases: none.

(See Wikipedia:ISBN and ISBN § Overview .) Hyphens in the ISBN are optional, but preferred. Use the ISBN actually printed on or in the book. Use the 13-digit ISBN – beginning with 978 or 979 – when it is available. If only a 10-digit ISBN is printed on or in the book, use it. ISBNs can be found on the page with the publisher's information – usually the back of the title page – or beneath the barcode as a number beginning with 978 or 979 (barcodes beginning with any other numbers are not ISBNs). For sources with the older 9-digit SBN system, use sbn. Do not convert a 10-digit ISBN to 13-digit by just adding the 978 prefix; the last digit is a calculated check digit and just making changes to the numbers will make the ISBN invalid. This parameter should hold only the ISBN without any additional characters. It is checked for length, invalid characters – anything other than numbers, spaces, and hyphens, with ""X"" permitted as the last character in a 10-digit ISBN – and the proper check digit.  Aliases: ISBN.

In very rare cases, identifiers are published which do not follow their defined standard format or use non-conforming checksums. These would typically cause an error message to be shown. Do not alter them to match a different checksum. In order to suppress the error message, some identifiers (|doi=, |eissn=, |isbn=, |issn=, and |sbn=) support a special accept-this-as-written markup which can be applied to disable the error-checking (as |<param>=((<value>))). If the problem is down to a mere typographical error in a third-party source, correct the identifier value instead of overriding the error message.
For some identifiers, it is possible to specify the access status using the corresponding |<param>-access= parameter.
For {{ cite journal }}, some identifiers (specifying free resources) will automatically be linked to the title when |url= and |title-link= are not used to specify a different link target. This behaviour can be overridden by one out of a number of special keywords for |title-link= to manually select a specific source (|title-link=pmc or |title-link=doi) for auto-linking or to disable the feature (|title-link=none).
It is not necessary to specify a URL to a link identical to a link also produced by an identifier. The |url= parameter (or |title-link=) can then be used for providing a direct deep link to the corresponding document or a convenience link to a resource that would not otherwise be obviously accessible.

Historical monuments
Panorama of Hyderabad
Charminar – a major landmark of Hyderabad with four graceful minarets located in the old city. It was built by Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah as a memorial for plague victims. Charminar, on most occasions, is used to represent the city and the state and is hailed as a unique Deccan monument. It is in the midst of Charkaman which are four archways to roads leading in all four directions from the Charminar monument. [9]
Mecca Masjid –  A symbolic mosque, Mecca Masjid was built 400 years ago during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Qutub Shah, the 6th Qutub Shahi Sultan of Hyderabad. The three-arched facade has been carved from a single piece of granite, which took five years to quarry. More than 8,000 workers were employed to build the mosque. Muhammed Qutub Shah personally laid the foundation stone.
Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, the French explorer, in his travelogue observed, ""It is about 50 years since they began to build a splendid pagoda in the town which will be the grandest in all India when it is completed. The size of the stone is the subject of special accomplishment, and that of a niche, which is its place for prayer, is an entire rock of such enormous size that they spent five years in quarrying it, and 500 to 600 men were employed continually on its work. It required still more time to roll it up on to conveyance by which they brought it to the pagoda; and they took 1400 oxen to draw it"".
Qutb Shahi Tombs in Hyderabad, India
Golconda Fort – Once abandoned by Qutub Shahis, Golconda Fort is one of the most magnificent fortress complexes in India. Seated on a hill on one side and spiraling fort on the other, its location and internal design made it one of the strongest forts in India. [10]
Qutb Shahi Tombs – home to various tombs dedicated to Rulers of Qutub Shahi dynasty , located at Shaikpet, near Golconda Fort. These are an example of Deccan architecture with large minarets, huge domes, delicate marble designs and multiple inner passages.

Chandigarh ( /ˌtʃʌndɪˈɡɑːr/ ) is a city and union territory in northern India , serving as the shared capital of the states of Punjab and Haryana . Situated near the foothills of the Shivalik range of Himalayas , it borders Haryana to the east and Punjab in the remaining directions. Chandigarh constitutes the bulk of the Chandigarh Capital Region or Greater Chandigarh, which also includes the adjacent satellite cities of Panchkula in Haryana and Mohali in Punjab. It is located 260 km (162 miles) northwest of New Delhi and 229 km (143 miles) southeast of Amritsar and 104 km (64 miles) southwest of Shimla .
Chandigarh is one of the earliest planned cities in post independence India and is internationally known for its architecture and urban design. [8] The master plan of the city was prepared by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier , which built upon earlier plans created by the Polish architect Maciej Nowicki and the American planner Albert Mayer . Most of the government buildings and housing in the city were designed by a team headed by Le Corbusier, Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry . Chandigarh's Capitol Complex —as part of a global ensemble of Corbusier's buildings—was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO at the 40th session of the World Heritage Conference in July 2016. [9]
Chandigarh has grown greatly since its initial construction, and has also driven the development of Mohali and Panchkula; the ""tri-city"" metropolitan area has a combined population of over 1,611,770. [10] The city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the country. The union territory has one of the highest Human Development Index among Indian states and territories. [11] In 2015, a survey by LG Electronics ranked it as the happiest city in India on the happiness index. [12] [13] [14] In 2015, an article published by BBC named Chandigarh one of the few master-planned cities in the world to have succeeded in terms of combining monumental architecture, cultural growth, and modernisation. [15]
Etymology
[ edit ]
The name Chandigarh is a compound of Chandi and Garh. Chandi refers to the Hindu goddess Chandi and Garh means fortress. [16] The name is derived from Chandi Mandir , an ancient temple devoted to Chandi near the city in Panchkula District. [17]
The motif or sobriquet of ""The City of Beauty"" was derived from the City Beautiful movement , which was a popular philosophy in North American urban planning during the 1890s and 1900s. Architect Albert Mayer , the initial planner of Chandigarh, lamented the American rejection of City Beautiful concepts and declared, ""We want to create a beautiful city..."" [18] The phrase was used as a logo in official publications in the 1970s and is now how the city describes itself. [19] [20]
History
[ edit ]
A map of the Punjab Province in colonial India (1909). During the Partition of India along the Radcliffe Line , the capital of the Punjab Province, Lahore , fell into West Punjab , Pakistan . The necessity to have a new capital for East Punjab in India then, led to the development of Chandigarh.

Some Indus Valley artefacts have been discovered on the site of Chandigarh, suggesting that the area was home to some settlements of the Indus Valley civilisation . [21] Present-day Chandigarh was also the site of a short-lived late 18th-century principality, with a small fort at Mani Majra . Many villages that predate the city are still inhabited within the modern blocks of some sectors, including Burail and Attawa, while several other such villages lie on the margins of the city. [22]
As part of the partition of India in 1947, the former Indian province of Punjab was divided into two parts, the mostly Hindu and Sikh East Punjab in India, and the mostly Muslim West Punjab in Pakistan . [23] The capital of undivided Punjab, Lahore , had become part of Pakistan after the partition. Instead of shifting the capital to an already existing and established city, Jawaharlal Nehru , the first Prime Minister of India, envisioned an altogether new and modern city to be built to serve as the capital of Punjab . [24] [25] Partap Singh Kairon , then the Chief Minister of East Punjab , and Edward Nirmal Mangat Rai , then the Chief Secretary of East Punjab, were instrumental in creating Chandigarh as the capital of the state. [26]
In 1949, the American planner and architect Albert Mayer was commissioned to design a new city to be called ""Chandigarh"". The government carved out Chandigarh from about fifty Puadhi -speaking villages in the then-state of East Punjab, India. [27] Shimla was the temporary capital of the state until Chandigarh was completed. Albert Mayer developed a superblock -based city interspersed with green spaces, with an emphasis on cellular neighbourhoods and traffic segregation. His site plan took advantage of natural land characteristics; the land's gentle grade promoted proper drainage. Mayer stopped his work on the city after his architect-partner Matthew Nowicki died in a plane crash in 1950. Government officials recruited Le Corbusier to succeed Mayer and Nowicki, who utilised many elements of Mayer's original plan without attributing them to him. [28] Le Corbusier designed many administration buildings, including the High Court, the Palace of Assembly, and the Secretariat Building. Le Corbusier also designed the general layout of the city, dividing it into sectors. Chandigarh hosts the largest of Le Corbusier's many Open Hand sculptures, standing 26 metres high. The Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier's architecture, a sign for him of ""peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive."" It represents what Le Corbusier called the ""Second Machine Age"". [9] Two of the six monuments planned in the Capitol Complex which has the High Court, the Assembly, and the Secretariat, remain incomplete. These include Geometric Hill and Martyrs Memorial. Drawings were made, and they were begun in 1956, but they were never completed. [29]
The capital city was officially shifted from Shimla to Chandigarh on 21 September 1953, though Chandigarh was formally inaugurated by India's first president, Rajendra Prasad on 7 October 1953. [30]
On 1 November 1966, after a long-drawn movement demanding the formation of a Punjabi state, the former state of Punjab was split in two . The western and northern mostly Punjabi -speaking portion became the present-day state of Punjab , while the eastern and southern Hindi- and Haryanvi -speaking areas became Haryana . Chandigarh ended up being located on the border of the two states, and both of them moved to incorporate the city into their respective territories. However, the city of Chandigarh was controlled directly by the central government and was to serve as the shared capital of the two states until a resolution could be reached. [31] It has been claimed by industrialists that large real-estate projects have stagnated since the creation of Chandigarh in Punjab and Haryana as an economic rival city would be perceived as a city that could be used as capital instead of Chandigarh and hence relinquishing the state of rights over Chandigarh. [32]

Many trees in Chandigarh are given the status of the natural heritage of the city. The Chandigarh government has identified a list of 31 trees as Heritage Trees. The Department of Forest & Wildlife Chandigarh Administration is the nodal department for this purpose and has published a detailed booklet about it. The trees in the city that are a hundred or more years old have been given heritage status.
Landscape
Sukhna Lake , a 3 km2 artificial rain-fed lake in Sector 1, [41] was created in 1958 by damming the Sukhna Choe, a seasonal stream coming down from the Shivalik Hills . [42]

Since the 1951–1961 period, the growth rate has decreased from 394.13% to 17.10%, a likely cause being the rapid urbanisation and development in neighbouring cities. [52] The urban population constitutes 97.25% of the total and the rural population makes up 2.75%, as there are only a few villages within Chandigarh, situated on its Western and South-Eastern border, and the majority of people live in the heart of Chandigarh.[ citation needed ]

Politics
[ edit ]
Chandigarh, as a union territory , is not entitled to a state-level election: thus State Assembly elections are not held and it is directly controlled by the central government . One seat for Chandigarh is allocated in the Lok Sabha elections held every five years.
Main article: Chandigarh Municipal Corporation
The city is governed by a civic administration or local government headed by Municipal Commissioner Anindita Mitra and Mayor Sarbjit Kaur. [67] [68] The city comprises 35 wards represented by 35 elected councillors , and also nominates 9 councillors. [69] [70]
On 27 March 2022, Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced that the Chandigarh employees who were working under the Punjab service rules until 2022, would be working under the central civil services rules from 1 April 2022. The move was criticised by political parties such as the AAP , the INC and the Akali Dal . [71]

The prime responsibilities of the civic body Municipal Corporation Chandigarh , are to ensure cleanliness and sanitation in the city, illumination of street lights, maintenance of parks, and sewerage disposal. [72] The city has both brick and pipe sewers laid in four phases. [73] In September 2020, the civic body announced that it would upgrade and renew the 50-year-old sewerage system. [73] The pilot project for the 24x7 water supply is expected to begin in Chandigarh in May 2021, which was initially to start in September 2020 and end in March 2022. On 8 April 2021, the Chandigarh Smart City Ltd (CSCL) board is yet to take the final decision. [74]
In 2021, the BJP-ruled corporation had increased the water tariff by 1.5 to 2.5 times. [75] This created a widespread discontent among the residents. [76]
In 2021, there was an acute shortage of parking spaces. The problem was aggravated by an increase of 17% in parking rates by the Municipal Corporation. [77] The increase in the waste collection charges, water tariff and property tax rates during the last five years 2016 to 2021 were unpopular among the public. [76]
During the COVID-19 pandemic in India , concerns were raised about whether sufficient relief measures had been taken by the local government. The sitting Councillors were accused of not being found to be approachable when the public needed support. [76]
Cleanliness
In 2016, Chandigarh was the second cleanest city of India .
In 2021, Chandigarh fell 66 positions in the list of cleanest cities in India. The garbage piled up at the Dadu Majra garbage dump site. [76] [78] The city's cleanliness was once a point for the city, and its decline became an important poll issue. [76]

Employment
[ edit ]
The government is a major employer in Chandigarh, with three governments having their base here, those being the Chandigarh Administration, the Punjab government, and the Haryana government. A significant percentage of Chandigarh's population, therefore, consists of people who are either working for one of these governments or have retired from government service, mainly armed forces. For this reason, Chandigarh is often called a ""Pensioner's Paradise"". [83] [ non-primary source needed ] Ordnance Cable Factory of the Ordnance Factories Board has been set up by the Government of India . There are about 15 medium-to-large industries, including two in the public sector . In addition, Chandigarh has over 2,500 units registered under the small-scale sector. [ citation needed ] The city's important industries are paper manufacturing, basic metals and alloys, and machinery. Other industries in the city are food products, sanitary ware, auto parts, machine tools, pharmaceuticals, and electrical appliances.[ citation needed ]
The main occupation here is trade and business. [84] [85] However, the Punjab and Haryana High Court , Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) , the availability of an IT Park, and more than a hundred government schools provide other job opportunities to people.
Four major trade promotion organisations have their offices in Chandigarh. These are The Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry, ASSOCHAM India , [86] Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry, (FICCI) the PhD Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) having regional offices in Chandigarh. [87] [88]
Chandigarh IT Park (also known as Rajiv Gandhi Chandigarh Technology Park) is the city's attempt to break into the information technology world. Chandigarh's infrastructure, proximity to Delhi , Haryana, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh , and the IT talent pool attract IT businesses looking for office space in the area. Major Indian firms and multinational corporations like Quark , Infosys , EVRY , TechMahindra , Airtel , Amadeus IT Group , DLF have set up base in the city and its suburbs.
The work of the Chandigarh Metro was slated to start by 2019. It was opposed by the Member of Parliament from Chandigarh, Kirron Kher . [89] With an estimated cost of around ₹109 billion including 50% funds from the governments of Punjab and Haryana and 25% from Chandigarh and government of India, funds from the Japanese government were proposed to include approximately 56% of the cost. [90] [91] However, the project was turned down owing to its non-feasibility. Kher promised a film city for Chandigarh. After winning the seat, she said that she had difficulty in acquiring land in Chandigarh. [92] Her proposal was accepted by the Chandigarh Administration and the film city is proposed to be set up in Sarangpur, Chandigarh. [93] This has been considered as a source of employment in the future.

Nehru said of Chandigarh when he first visited the site of the new city in 1952: ""Let this be a new town, symbolic of the freedom of India, unfettered by the traditions of the past, an expression of the nation's faith in the future"". [112] For Nehru, Chandigarh represented a vision of how a new planned city could be a canvas for the regeneration of the nation itself after centuries of oppression under British colonial rule and the dilution of Indian character from the nation's towns. Guided by the architectural optics of Le Corbusier , the development of Chandigarh was part of a state-driven exercise to break from the traditions of imperialism in city making and begin the process of healing from the injustices suffered. [113]
To the extent that Chandigarh epitomises the destructive influence of the British, in the impetus of its creation as a solution to the otherwise violent partitioning of territory between India and Pakistan, it represents an early ideological symbol for the birth of India's future. The selection of the physical site involved an extensive vetting process. Many existing towns in Punjab were surveyed as options for the new capital and dismissed for poor performance concerning factors such as military defensibility and capacity for accommodating potential refugee influxes. The construction of a new town in Chandigarh was determined to be the best option due to its relative strength in these factors as well as its proximity to the national capital, New Delhi, its central location within the state of Punjab, its abundance of fecund land and its beautiful natural landscape. [114]

Modernism in new town design
[ edit ]
Off the back of this conflation of assets Chandigarh then was well poised to serve a function as a city-building project in national identity. From a federal policy perspective, the development of the new town became a tool in India for modernisation and an intended driver of economic activity, legal reform, and regional growth as well as a significant agent for the decolonisation project. [115] As Britain's grip on their empire began to weaken their accelerated withdrawal between the beginning of the second world war and 1947 left their former colony in states of disarray and disorganisation, and policymakers for the new Indian government were required to contend with issues such as rapid rural depopulation, urban congestion, and poverty. As well as in Chandigarh this policy tool was implemented in the creation of new capital cities in Bhubaneswar and Gandhinagar , and more broadly throughout India in the 112 planned cities created between independence and 1971, purposed to absorb migration from those regions in demise after being abandoned by the British and provide hubs for growing industries such as in steel and energy. [116]
These examples from a genealogy of utopian urban forms developed in post-independence India as a panacea for issues related to underdevelopment as well as post-independence complications to do with separatist religious conflict and the resulting diplomatic tensions. Chandigarh is the first example of a state-funded master-planned modernisation scheme . These ""urban utopias"" attempt to enforce nation-building policies through a federalised rule of law at a regional level, and diffuse postcolonial urbanism which codes justice in its design. [117] The intent is that the economic success and progressivism of cities such as Chandigarh as a lightning rod for social change would gradually be emulated at the scale of the nation. Chandigarh was for Nehru and Le Corbusier an embodiment of the egalitarian potential offered by modernism , where the machine age would complete the liberation of the nation's citizens through the productive capacity of industrial technology and the relative ease of constructing civic facilities such as dams, hospitals, and schools; the very antithesis of the conservative and traditional legacy of colonialism. [115] Though built as a state capital Chandigarh came to be focused on industry and higher education. [116] The specialisation of these new towns in particular functions represents a crucial aspect of the modernisation process as a decolonising enterprise, in completing a national portfolio where each town forms a part of the utopian model for contemporary India.
The post-colonialism of Chandigarh is rooted in the transformation of the political ideas of those such as Nehru who generated a new Indian nationalism through the design of newly built forms. [118] Scholars such as Edward Said have emphasised the sinister nature of nostalgia and the romanticisation of colonial architecture in newly independent colonies as artefacts that perpetuate the ideological legacy of the hegemony and replicate the hierarchy of power even after decolonisation. [119] Insofar as modernism in architecture (which defined town planning under the Nehru era of rule) represents an active radical break from tradition and a colonial past even the very presence of Le Corbusier has been recognised as an indelible resistance to the British construction legacy, as he provided the first non-British influence on design thinking in India, enabling a generational shift in the contemporary cohort of architects and planners to be hired by the state throughout the rest of the century who were initiated under Modernist conditioning. [118]
As early as the 1950s the presence of the International Style could be detected in the design of houses in India, ""whether mistri or architect-designed"". [120] The development of low-cost housing was a priority for Chandigarh, and the modern forms designed by Corbusier are characterised by a dispensing with colonial forms focused on classic aesthetics and a refocusing on strategies such as using narrow frontages and orientation for minimising direct exposure to the sun and maximising natural ventilation and efficient cost while providing modern amenities in the International Style aesthetic. [121] These developments are credited as the beginning of a ""Chandigarh architecture"", inspiring gradual experimentation with form and an ""Indianising"" of the International Style which precipitated the formation of the country's new cultural identity in town design. [118]
In 2024, Tropical Modernism: Architecture and Independence, an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum , London, featured designs for Chandigarh. [122]
Criticisms
[ edit ]
Criticisms are well established regarding the implementation of the postcolonial vision of Nehru and Le Corbusier and the critical emphasis on its influence. Claims have been made that the focus on Corbusier's architect-centred discourse erases the plural authorship of the narrative of Chandigarh's development, arguing that it was, in fact, a hybridity of values and of ""contested modernities"" of Western and indigenous Indian origin and cultural exchanges rather than an uncontested administrative enterprise. [123] Such criticism is consistent with claims that decolonisation in India has marked a shift from segregation based on race to segregation based on class and that planned cities are truly ""designed"" ones which represent the values and interests of a westernised middle-class Indian elite which ignore the complexities of India's diverse ethnic and cultural landscape and enabled neocolonial hierarchies such as the imposition of the Hindi language on non-conforming castes. [113] [115] [118]
Brent C. Brolin argues that Le Corbusier ignored Indian preferences in designing the housing and communities and that the residents have done what they can to recreate their accustomed lifestyle. [124] Furthermore, the early over-saturation of the minimalist International Style in building design in Chandigarh has attracted criticisms of effecting a ""democratic, self-effacing banality"", though this criticism is perhaps negligent of how this was necessary for galvanising higher standards of urban living throughout the country.

Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah
hide
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
4 April 1565 Golconda , Golconda Sultanate (now in Telangana , India)
Died
Shia Islam
Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah (4 April 1565 – 11 January 1612) was the fifth sultan of the Sultanate of Golconda and founder of the city of Hyderabad . [2] He built its architectural centerpiece, the Charminar . He was an able administrator and his reign is considered one of the high points of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. He ascended to the throne in 1580 at the age of 15 and ruled for 31 years. [3]
Early life and reign
Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah was the third son of Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah Wali of the Sultanate of Golconda and Hindu mother Bhagirathi. [4]
The Shah's wedding party with his bride, the Hindu dancing-girl Bhagmati.
Charminar in Hyderabad was built by Quli Qutub Shah
Muhammad succeeded his father in the year 1580 at the age of 15. [3] His rule lasted for 31 years. He faced minor rebellions on the eastern and western fronts of the sultanate during the initial years of his rule. He led the troops himself and defeated Ali Khan Loor and Yashwant Raj. [5]
In 1592 further disturbance was created by Shah Saheb for ascending the throne. During this time he sent Aitbar Khan with a large troop and he defeated Shah Saheb. Amidst the chaos Muhammad Quli was still able to patronage art and establish the city of Hyderabad. [5] His reign is considered the high point of the Sultanate of Golconda. [3]
Founding of Hyderabad
[ edit ]
From the time of his father Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah, there was a high influx of populace into the city of Golconda , which led to over-crowding and unhygienic conditions. This created the need for an extension or new city. [3] The construction of Hyderabad was initiated in 1591, on the southern bank of the River Musi . Before construction he prayed by reciting the following couplet for the welfare of the  city: ""Make my city full of people, like you keep the river full of fish."" [5]
There is a degree of folklore associated with selection of the land for the new city of Hyderabad. It is said that once the sultan was coming back from a hunt and he crossed the bridge across River Musi and arrived at the flat land which pleased him. However, Muhammad Quli must have been aware of the presence of this land and the story is a romanticised version. [3]
The city was planned in a gridiron manner with the Charminar in the centre and other important palaces and administrative buildings along the surrounding axes. Other important buildings which were constructed in the following years such as Dar-ul-Shifa , Mecca Masjid , Badshahi Ashurkhana and several palaces which have since been demolished. [5]
Muhammad Quli also planned several gardens throughout the city. [5]
Patronage of art and literature
[ edit ]
Dancing before Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Golconda, about 1590
Muhammad Quli was a patron of poetry, paintings, calligraphy and architecture. Major scripts used in this period are Nastaliq, Naksh, Kufi, Tughra and Sulus. A unique inscription is on Mecca Masjid in Nastaliq script, a script not known anywhere else in the Deccan region. Another inscription in the same mosque is a verse of the Quran carved in Naksh style. [5] [6]
Muhammad Quli was an accomplished poet and wrote his poetry in Persian , Telugu and Urdu . [7] [3] He is considered one of the first poets to write in the Deccani Urdu language. He wrote in a wide range of genres from religious to romantic to profane. [3] He composed his verses in the Persian diwan style, and his poems consisted of verses relating to a single topic, gazal-i musalsal. [7] His poetry has been compiled into a volume entitled Kulliyat-e-Quli Qutub Shah. [8] Over half of its 1800 pages were gazals, while qasidas were present on one hundred pages, and the rest over 300 pages of matnawi and marsiyas. [7] He was the first Saheb-e-dewan Urdu poet. [8]
Physicians who wrote Persian language books on Unani medicine during his reign include Mir Momin (Ikhtiyarat-i Qutub Shahi), Shamsuddin Ali Husain al-Jurjani      (Tazkirat-i Kahhalin), Hakim Shamsuddin bin Nuruddin (Zubdat-ul Hukama), Abdullah Tabib (Tibb-i Farid), Taqiuddin Muhammad bin Sadruddin Ali (Mizan-ul Tabai'), Nizamuddin Ahmad Gilani (Majmu'a-i Hakim-ul mulk), and Ismai'l bin Ibrahim Tabrezi (Tazkirat-ul Hukama).

Languages of Telangana
[ edit ]
About 76% of the population of Telangana speak Telugu , 12% speak Urdu , and 12% speak other languages. [6] [7] Before 1948, Urdu was the official language of Hyderabad State , and due to a lack of Telugu-language in educational institutions, Urdu was spoken by the educated people of Telangana, including the elite. After 1948, once Hyderabad State joined the new Republic of India, Telugu became the language of government, and as Telugu was introduced as the medium of instruction in schools and colleges, the use of Urdu among non-Muslims decreased. [8]
Literature
Poets of Telangana from the early era include Bammera Pothana , Kancherla Gopanna or Bhakta Ramadasu, Malliya Rechana , Gona Budda Reddy , Kuppambika , Palkurthi Somanatha , Mallinātha Sūri , and Hulukki Bhaskara. In the modern era poets include such figures as Padma Vibhushan Kaloji Narayana Rao , Sahitya Akademi Award recipient Daasarathi Krishnamacharyulu , and Jnanpith Award recipient C. Narayana Reddy , as well as P. V. Narasimha Rao , ninth Prime Minister of India . Samala Sadasiva was selected for the Kendra Sahitya Puraskaram distinction. His book Swaralayalu on the subject of Hindustani classical music won the award for the year 2011. [9]

Urdu literature has always enjoyed patronage from successive rulers of the Qutb Shahi and Asaf Jahi era. Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah , the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty is regarded as one of the pioneers of early Urdu poetry.
During the rule of Nizams of Hyderabad , printing was introduced in the area. The 18th-century courtesan and poet Mah Laqa Bai are also regarded as a pioneer of this time. During the 18th 19th and 20th centuries, many Urdu scholars emigrated to Hyderabad seeking the patronage of the Nizam . This included Fani Badayuni , Josh Malihabadi and Dagh Dehlavi . Other scholars of repute from Telangana included Makhdoom Mohiuddin and Sayyid Shamsullah Qadri .
Religion
Main article: Demographics of Telangana
The major religions of the people are Hinduism and Islam , [10] though Buddhism was the dominant religion up to the 6th century. Hinduism was revived during the time of the Chalukyas and the Kakantiyas in the 12th century. The Vijayanagar rule saw the glorious days of Hinduism when the famed emperors, Krishnadeva Raya in particular, built new temples and beautified the old ones. Shiva, Vishnu, Hanuman and Ganapati have been the popular Hindu Gods. The Vugra Narasimha Swami Temple at Yadagirigutta and Thousand Pillar Temple at Warangal are among the oldest shrines in the state attracting people from different parts of the country for hundreds of years.
In terms of influence, Islam occupies the second place. It started spreading from the 14th century onwards. Mosques began to come up in many parts of the region during the Muslim rule. Christianity began to spread from 1701, especially among the socially disabled people. Educational institutions and churches grew in number in the Circars in the 18th-19th centuries when the East India Company and later the British government encouraged them. Other European countries were also active in building churches and taking care of the weaker sections of the people.

Spouse: Rukmini Bai
Awards: Padma Vibhushan
Better known as Kaloji or Kalanna, he was an Indian poet, freedom fighter, Anti-fascist and political activist of Telangana. He was a prolific writer and poet in Telugu , Urdu , Hindi , and Marathi . He was also a respected political activist who staunchly opposed the feudal attitude of Nizams. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1992.
Kaloji Narayana Rao's full name according to his SSC certificate is Raghuveer Narayan Srinivasan Kaloji.
Kaloji completed his primary education in Madikonda and higher education in Warangal and Hyderabad.
Movements
[ edit ]
Since his student days he was deeply influenced by the popular movements of the time like the Arya Samaj Movement, especially the civil rights part of it, the Library Movement and the Andhra Maha Sabha Movement. He was also part of Satyagraha movement, the Osmania University Student Vandemataram movement, Arya Samaj, State Congress, Andhra Mahasabha(Telangana) and Anti-Razakar movements. Kaloji took part in Andhra Maha Sabha activities since its formation in 1934. He was also associated with the Arya Samaj.
He actively participated in the freedom movement of the erstwhile Hyderabad State and underwent imprisonment under the Nizam. He has also participated in various social, political and literary activities in Andhra Pradesh. His active involvement with the masses and their problems and his tireless struggle for their emancipation have naturally earned him in equal measure the love of the people and the wrath of the powers that be. He is one of those select freedom fighters of our country who were imprisoned by the feudal lords and the alien rulers before the attainment of Indian Independence and also by the native leaders thereafter.
He has consistently fought for the democratic and responsible government. His commitment to human rights made him an active member of the Tarkunde Committee. Although opposed to power and the trapping of office Kaloji looked upon elections as a democratic exercise. He ran for public office three times and was elected once as a member of the legislative council. His most significant contest was in 1977 against Vengal Rao then Chief Minister who symbolised the 'emergency' rule in Andhra Pradesh.

Indian religions, sometimes also termed Dharmic religions or Indic religions, are the religions that originated in the Indian subcontinent . These religions, which include Buddhism , Hinduism , Jainism , and Sikhism , [web 1] [note 1] are also classified as Eastern religions . Although Indian religions are connected through the history of India , they constitute a wide range of religious communities, and are not confined to the Indian subcontinent. [web 1]

Evidence attesting to prehistoric religion in the Indian subcontinent derives from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings. The Harappan people of the Indus Valley civilisation , which lasted from 3300 to 1300 BCE (mature period 2600–1900 BCE), had an early urbanized culture which predates the Vedic religion. [5] [ better source needed ]
The documented history of Indian religions begins with the historical Vedic religion , the religious practices of the early Indo-Aryan peoples , which were collected and later redacted into the Vedas , as well as the Agamas of Dravidian origin. The period of the composition, redaction, and commentary of these texts is known as the Vedic period , which lasted from roughly 1750 to 500 BCE. [6] The philosophical portions of the Vedas were summarized in Upanishads , which are commonly referred to as Vedānta , variously interpreted to mean either the ""last chapters, parts of the Veda"" or ""the object, the highest purpose of the Veda"". [7] The early Upanishads all predate the Common Era, five [note 2] of the eleven principal Upanishads were composed in all likelihood before 6th century BCE, [8] [9] and contain the earliest mentions of yoga and moksha . [10]
The śramaṇa period between 800 and 200 BCE marks a ""turning point between the Vedic Hinduism and Puranic Hinduism"". [11] The Shramana movement, an ancient Indian religious movement parallel to but separate from Vedic tradition, often defied many of the Vedic and Upanishadic concepts of soul (Atman) and the ultimate reality (Brahman). In 6th century BCE, the Shramnic movement matured into Jainism [12] and Buddhism [13] and was responsible for the schism of Indian religions into two main philosophical branches of astika, which venerates Veda (e.g., six orthodox schools of Hinduism) and nastika (e.g., Buddhism, Jainism, Charvaka, etc.). However, both branches shared the related concepts of yoga, saṃsāra (the cycle of birth and death) and moksha (liberation from that cycle). [note 3] [note 4] [note 5]
The Puranic Period (200 BCE – 500 CE) and Early Medieval period (500–1100 CE) gave rise to new configurations of Hinduism, especially bhakti and Shaivism , Shaktism , Vaishnavism , Smarta , and smaller groups like the conservative Shrauta .
The early Islamic period (1100–1500 CE) also gave rise to new movements. Sikhism was founded in the 15th century on the teachings of Guru Nanak and the nine successive Sikh Gurus in Northern India . [web 2] The vast majority of its adherents originate in the Punjab region .  During the period of British rule in India , a reinterpretation and synthesis of Hinduism arose, which aided the Indian independence movement .
History
Main article: Periodisation of Hinduism
Scottish historian James Mill , in his seminal work The History of British India (1817), distinguished three phases in the history of India, namely the Hindu, Muslim, and British periods. This periodisation has been criticised, for the misconceptions it has given rise to. Another periodisation is the division into ""ancient, classical, medieval, and modern periods"", although this periodization has also received criticism. [16]
Romila Thapar notes that the division of Hindu-Muslim-British periods of Indian history gives too much weight to ""ruling dynasties and foreign invasions"", [17] neglecting the social-economic history which often showed a strong continuity. [17] The division in Ancient-Medieval-Modern overlooks the fact that the Muslim conquests took place between the eight and the fourteenth centuries, while the south was never completely conquered. [17] According to Thapar, a periodisation could also be based on ""significant social and economic changes"", which are not strictly related to a change of ruling powers. [18] [note 6]
Smart and Michaels seem to follow Mill's periodisation, while Flood and Muesse follow the ""ancient, classical, mediaeval and modern periods"" periodisation. An elaborate periodisation may be as follows: [19]
Indian pre-history including Indus Valley civilisation (until c. 1750 BCE)
Iron Age including Vedic period (c. 1750–600 BCE)
""Second Urbanisation"" (c. 600–200 BCE)
Classical period (c. 200 BCE – 1200 CE) [note 7]
Pre-Classical period (c. 200 BCE – 320 CE)
""Golden Age"" (Gupta Empire) (c. 320–650 CE)
Late-Classical period (c. 650–1200 CE)
Medieval period (c. 1200–1500 CE)
Early Modern (c. 1500–1850)
Modern period (British Raj and independence) (from c. 1850)
Prevedic religions (before c. 1750 BCE)
Prehistory
The earliest religion followed by the peoples of the Indian subcontinent, including those of the Indus Valley and Ganges Valley , was likely local animism that did not have missionaries . [24]
""Priest King"" of Indus Valley civilisation
Evidence attesting to prehistoric religion in the Indian subcontinent derives from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings such as at Bhimbetka , depicting dances and rituals. Neolithic agriculturalists inhabiting the Indus River Valley buried their dead in a manner suggestive of spiritual practices that incorporated notions of an afterlife and belief in magic. [25] Other South Asian Stone Age sites, such as the Bhimbetka rock shelters in central Madhya Pradesh and the Kupgal petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka, contain rock art portraying religious rites and evidence of possible ritualised music.

Indus Valley civilisation
Further information: Prehistoric religion
The religion and belief system of the Indus Valley people has received considerable attention, especially from the view of identifying precursors to deities and religious practices of Indian religions that later developed in the area. However, due to the sparsity of evidence, which is open to varying interpretations, and the fact that the Indus script remains undeciphered, the conclusions are partly speculative and largely based on a retrospective view from a much later Hindu perspective. [26] An early and influential work in the area that set the trend for Hindu interpretations of archaeological evidence from the Harrapan sites [27] was that of John Marshall , who in 1931 identified the following as prominent features of the Indus religion: a Great Male God and a Mother Goddess; deification or veneration of animals and plants; symbolic representation of the phallus ( linga ) and vulva ( yoni ); and, use of baths and water in religious practice. Marshall's interpretations have been much debated, and sometimes disputed over the following decades. [28] [29]
The so-called Pashupati seal, showing a seated and possibly ithyphallic figure, surrounded by animals.
One Indus valley seal shows a seated figure with a horned headdress, surrounded by animals. Marshall identified the figure as an early form of the Hindu god Shiva (or Rudra ), who is associated with asceticism, yoga , and linga; regarded as a lord of animals; and often depicted as having three eyes. The seal has hence come to be known as the Pashupati Seal , after Pashupati (lord of all animals), an epithet of Shiva. [28] [30] While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections. Doris Srinivasan has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in Vedic literature Rudra was not a protector of wild animals. [31] [32] Herbert Sullivan and Alf Hiltebeitel also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with Mahisha, the Buffalo God and the surrounding animals with vahanas (vehicles) of deities for the four cardinal directions. [33] [34] Writing in 2002, Gregory L. Possehl concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognise the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would be going too far. [30] Despite the criticisms of Marshall's association of the seal with a proto-Shiva icon, it has been interpreted as the Tirthankara Rishabha by Jains and Vilas Sangave [35] or an early Buddha by Buddhists. [27] Historians like Heinrich Zimmer , Thomas McEvilley are of the opinion that there exists some link between first Jain Tirthankara Rishabha and Indus Valley civilisation. [36] [37]
Marshall hypothesized the existence of a cult of Mother Goddess worship based upon excavation of several female figurines, and thought that this was a precursor of the Hindu sect of Shaktism . However the function of the female figurines in the life of Indus Valley people remains unclear, and Possehl does not regard the evidence for Marshall's hypothesis to be ""terribly robust"". [38] Some of the baetyls interpreted by Marshall to be sacred phallic representations are now thought to have been used as pestles or game counters instead, while the ring stones that were thought to symbolise yoni were determined to be architectural features used to stand pillars, although the possibility of their religious symbolism cannot be eliminated. [39]
Many Indus Valley seals show animals, with some depicting them being carried in processions, while others show chimeric creations . [40] One seal from Mohen-jodaro shows a half-human, half-buffalo monster attacking a tiger, which may be a reference to the Sumerian myth of such a monster created by goddess Aruru to fight Gilgamesh . [41] Some seals show a man wearing a hat with two horns and a plant sitting on a throne with animals surrounding him. [42] Some scholars theorize that this was a predecessor to Shiva wearing a hat worn by some Sumerian divine beings and kings. [42]
In contrast to contemporary Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilisations, the Indus Valley lacks any monumental palaces, even though excavated cities indicate that the society possessed the requisite engineering knowledge. [43] [44] This may suggest that religious ceremonies, if any, may have been largely confined to individual homes, small temples, or the open air. Several sites have been proposed by Marshall and later scholars as possibly devoted to religious purpose, but at present only the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro is widely thought to have been so used, as a place for ritual purification. [38] [45] The funerary practices of the Harappan civilisation is marked by its diversity with evidence of supine burial; fractional burial in which the body is reduced to skeletal remains by exposure to the elements before final interment; and even cremation. [46] [47]
Vedic period (1750–800 BCE)
See also: Proto-Indo-European mythology and Proto-Indo-Iranian religion
The documented history of Indian religions begins with the historical Vedic religion , the religious practices of the early Indo-Aryans , which were collected and later redacted into the Samhitas (usually known as the Vedas ), four canonical collections of hymns or mantras composed in archaic Sanskrit . These texts are the central shruti (revealed) texts of Hinduism . The period of the composition, redaction, and commentary of these texts is known as the Vedic period , which lasted from roughly 1750 to 500 BCE. [6]
The Vedic Period is most significant for the composition of the four Vedas, Brahmanas and the older Upanishads (both presented as discussions on the rituals, mantras and concepts found in the four Vedas), which today are some of the most important canonical texts of Hinduism, and are the codification of much of what developed into the core beliefs of Hinduism. [48]
Some modern Hindu scholars use the ""Vedic religion"" synonymously with ""Hinduism"". [49] According to Sundararajan, Hinduism is also known as the Vedic religion. [50] Other authors state that the Vedas contain ""the fundamental truths about Hindu Dharma"" [note 8] which is called ""the modern version of the ancient Vedic Dharma"" [52] The Arya Samaj is recognize the Vedic religion as true Hinduism. [53] Nevertheless, according to Jamison and Witzel
... to call this period Vedic Hinduism is a contradiction in terms since Vedic religion is very different from what we generally call Hindu religion – at least as much as Old Hebrew religion is from medieval and modern Christian religion. However, Vedic religion is treatable as a predecessor of Hinduism."" [48] [note 9]
Early Vedic period – early Vedic compositions (c. 1750–1200 BCE)
Main articles: Vedas and Samhitas
The rishis , the composers of the hymns of the Rigveda , were considered inspired poets and seers. [note 10]
The mode of worship was the performance of Yajna , sacrifices which involved sacrifice and sublimation of the havana sámagri (herbal preparations) [55] in the fire, accompanied by the singing of Samans and 'mumbling' of Yajus , the sacrificial mantras. The sublime meaning of the word yajna is derived from the Sanskrit verb yaj, which has a three-fold meaning of worship of deities (devapujana), unity (saògatikaraña), and charity (dána). [56] An essential element was the sacrificial fire – the divine Agni – into which oblations were poured, as everything offered into the fire was believed to reach God.[ citation needed ]
Central concepts in the Vedas are Satya and Rta . Satya is derived from Sat , the present participle of the verbal root as, ""to be, to exist, to live"". [57] Sat means ""that which really exists [...] the really existent truth; the Good"", [57] and Sat-ya means ""is-ness"". [58] Rta, ""that which is properly joined; order, rule; truth"", is the principle of natural order which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it. [59] ""Satya (truth as being) and rita (truth as law) are the primary principles of Reality and its manifestation is the background of the canons of dharma, or a life of righteousness."" [60] ""Satya is the principle of integration rooted in the Absolute, rita is its application and function as the rule and order operating in the universe."" [61] Conformity with Ṛta would enable progress whereas its violation would lead to punishment. Panikkar remarks:
Ṛta is the ultimate foundation of everything; it is ""the supreme"", although this is not to be understood in a static sense. [...] It is the expression of the primordial dynamism that is inherent in everything...."" [62]
The term rta is inherited from the Proto-Indo-Iranian religion , the religion of the Indo-Iranian peoples prior to the earliest Vedic (Indo-Aryan) and Zoroastrian (Iranian) scriptures. "" Asha "" is the Avestan language term (corresponding to Vedic language ṛta ) for a concept of cardinal importance [63] to Zoroastrian theology and doctrine. The term ""dharma"" was already used in Brahmanical thought, where it was conceived as an aspect of Rta. [64]
Major philosophers of this era were Rishis Narayana, Kanva, Rishaba , Vamadeva , and Angiras . [65]
Middle Vedic period (c. 1200–850 BCE)
See also: Painted Grey Ware culture
During the Middle Vedic period, the mantras of the Yajurveda and the older Brahmana texts were composed. [66] The Brahmans became powerful intermediairies. [67]
Historical roots of Jainism in India is traced back to 9th-century BCE with the rise of Parshvanatha and his non-violent philosophy. [68] [69]
Late Vedic period (from 850 BCE)
The Vedic religion evolved into Hinduism and Vedanta , a religious path considering itself the 'essence' of the Vedas, interpreting the Vedic pantheon as a unitary view of the universe with 'God' (Brahman) seen as immanent and transcendent in the forms of Ishvara and Brahman . This post-Vedic systems of thought, along with the Upanishads and later texts like the epics (the Ramayana and the Mahabharata ), is a major component of modern Hinduism. The ritualistic traditions of Vedic religion are preserved in the conservative Śrauta tradition.[ citation needed ]
Sanskritization
Main article: Sanskritization
Since Vedic times, ""people from many strata of society throughout the subcontinent tended to adapt their religious and social life to Brahmanic norms"", a process sometimes called Sanskritization . [70] It is reflected in the tendency to identify local deities with the gods of the Sanskrit texts. [70]
Shramanic period (c. 800–200 BCE)
A statue of Gautama Buddha from Sarnath , Uttar Pradesh , India, 4th century CE.

During the time of the shramanic reform movements ""many elements of the Vedic religion were lost"". [11] According to Michaels, ""it is justified to see a turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions"". [11]
Late Vedic period – Brahmanas and Upanishads – Vedanta (850–500 BCE)
Main articles: Brahmanas , Upanishads , and Vedanta
The late Vedic period (9th to 6th centuries BCE) marks the beginning of the Upanisadic or Vedantic period. [web 4] [note 11] [71] [note 12] This period heralded the beginning of much of what became classical Hinduism, with the composition of the Upanishads , [73] later the Sanskrit epics , still later followed by the Puranas .
Upanishads form the speculative-philosophical basis of classical Hinduism and are known as Vedanta (conclusion of the Vedas ). [74] The older Upanishads launched attacks of increasing intensity on the ritual. Anyone who worships a divinity other than the Self is called a domestic animal of the gods in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. The Mundaka launches the most scathing attack on the ritual by comparing those who value sacrifice with an unsafe boat that is endlessly overtaken by old age and death. [75]
Scholars believe that Parsva , the 23rd Jain tirthankara lived during this period in the 9th century BCE. [76]
Rise of Shramanic tradition (7th to 5th centuries BCE)
See also: Shramana and Magadha
Buddha statue at Darjeeling
Jainism and Buddhism belong to the śramaṇa traditions. These religions rose into prominence in 700–500 BCE [12] [77] [78] in the Magadha kingdom., reflecting ""the cosmology and anthropology of a much older, pre-Aryan upper class of northeastern India"", [79] and were responsible for the related concepts of saṃsāra (the cycle of birth and death) and moksha (liberation from that cycle). [80] [note 13]
The shramana movements challenged the orthodoxy of the rituals. [81] The shramanas were wandering ascetics distinct from Vedism. [82] [83] [note 14] [84] [note 15] [85] [note 16] Mahavira, proponent of Jainism, and Buddha (c. 563-483), founder of Buddhism were the most prominent icons of this movement.
Shramana gave rise to the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of samsara , and the concept of liberation. [80] [note 17] [86] [note 18] [88] [note 19] [note 20] The influence of Upanishads on Buddhism has been a subject of debate among scholars. While Radhakrishnan , Oldenberg and Neumann were convinced of Upanishadic influence on the Buddhist canon, Eliot and Thomas highlighted the points where Buddhism was opposed to Upanishads. [91] Buddhism may have been influenced by some Upanishadic ideas, it however discarded their orthodox tendencies. [92] In Buddhist texts Buddha is presented as rejecting avenues of salvation as ""pernicious views"". [93]
Jainism
Main articles: Mahavira , Jainism , Timeline of Jainism , and Jain community
Jainism was established by a lineage of 24 enlightened beings culminating with Parshvanatha (9th century BCE) and Mahavira (6th century BCE). [94] [note 21]
The 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, Mahavira, stressed five vows, including ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truthfulness), asteya (non-stealing), and aparigraha (non-attachment). As per Jain tradition, the teachings of the Tirthankaras predates all known time. The scholars believe Parshva , accorded status as the 23rd Tirthankara, was a historical figure. The Vedas are believed to have documented a few Tirthankaras and an ascetic order similar to the shramana movement. [95] [note 22]
Buddhism

Buddhism was historically founded by Siddhartha Gautama , a Kshatriya prince-turned-ascetic, [96] and was spread beyond India through missionaries. [97] It later experienced a decline in India, but survived in Nepal [98] and Sri Lanka , and remains more widespread in Southeast and East Asia . [99]
Gautama Buddha , who was called an ""awakened one"" ( Buddha ), was born into the Shakya clan living at Kapilavastu and Lumbini in what is now southern Nepal. The Buddha was born at Lumbini, as emperor Ashoka 's Lumbini pillar records, just before the kingdom of Magadha (which traditionally is said to have lasted from c. 546–324 BCE) rose to power.  The Shakyas claimed Angirasa and Gautama Maharishi lineage, [100] via descent from the royal lineage of Ayodhya.
Buddhism emphasises enlightenment (nibbana, nirvana) and liberation from the rounds of rebirth. This objective is pursued through two schools, Theravada, the Way of the Elders (practiced in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, SE Asia, etc.) [101] and Mahayana, the Greater Way (practiced in Tibet, China, Japan, etc.). [102] There may be some differences in the practice between the two schools in reaching the objective.[ citation needed ]

The Kakatiya dynasty ( IAST : Kākatīya) [a] was a Telugu dynasty that ruled most of eastern Deccan region in present-day India between 12th and 14th centuries. [6] Their territory comprised much of the present day Telangana and Andhra Pradesh , and parts of eastern Karnataka , northern Tamil Nadu , and southern Odisha . [7] [8] Their capital was Orugallu, now known as Warangal .
Early Kakatiya rulers served as feudatories to Rashtrakutas and Western Chalukyas for more than two centuries. They assumed sovereignty under Prataparudra I in 1163 CE by suppressing other Chalukya subordinates in the Telangana region. [9] Ganapati Deva (r. 1199–1262) significantly expanded Kakatiya lands during the 1230s and brought under Kakatiya control the Telugu-speaking lowland delta areas around the Godavari and Krishna rivers. Ganapati Deva was succeeded by Rudrama Devi (r. 1262–1289) who is one of the few queens in Indian history. Marco Polo , who visited India around 1289–1293, made note of Rudrama Devi's rule and nature in flattering terms. She successfully repelled the attacks of Yadavas (Seuna) of Devagiri into the Kakatiyan territory. [9]
In 1303, Alauddin Khalji , the emperor of the Delhi Sultanate invaded the Kakatiya territory which ended up as a disaster for the Turks. [b] But after the successful siege of Warangal in 1310, Prataparudra II was forced to pay annual tribute to Delhi. Another attack by Ulugh Khan (i.e. Tughluq) in 1323 saw stiff resistance by the Kakatiyan army, but they were finally defeated. The demise of the Kakatiya dynasty resulted in confusion and anarchy under alien rulers for some time, before Musunuri Nayakas united the various Telugu clans and recovered Warangal from the Delhi Sultanate . [10]
Kakatiyas unified the distinct upland and lowland cultures of Telugu lands, which brought into being a feeling of cultural affinity between those who spoke the Telugu language . Kakatiya period also saw the construction of reservoirs for irrigation in the uplands called ""tanks"" many of which are still used today. They were egalitarian in nature and anyone, regardless of birth, could acquire the nayaka title that denoted the warrior status. They recruited peasants into the military which resulted in a new warrior class and provided social mobility. Kakatiya era also saw the development of a distinct style of architecture that improved and innovated upon the existing modes. [11] Most notable examples are the Thousand Pillar Temple in Hanamkonda , Ramappa Temple in Palampet, Warangal Fort , Golconda Fort and Kota Gullu in Ghanpur .
Etymology and names
Studies of the inscriptions and coinage by the historian Dineshchandra Sircar reveal that there was no contemporary standard spelling of the family name. Variants include Kakatiya, Kakatiyya, Kakita, Kakati and Kakatya. The family name was often prefixed to the name of the monarch, giving constructs such as Kakatiya-Prataparudra. Some of the monarchs also had alternate names; for example, Venkata and Venkataraya may have been alternate names of Prataparuda I, with the former appearing on a coin in the form Venkata-Kakatiya. [12] [c]
According to Kakatiya inscriptions, the family's name derives from the name of a place called Kakati. However, Kumarasvami Somapithin, in his 15th-century commentary on Vidynatha's Prataparudra-Yashobhushanam or Prataparudriya states that the family was named after their tutelary goddess Kakati, a form of Durga . [13] [14] It is possible that the early Kakatiya chiefs resided at a place called Kakati, which had a shrine of their tutelary goddess. [15] [16]
Although the Hindu mythological texts do not mention any such form of Durga, the worship of a goddess named Kakati is attested by several other sources. For example, Vallabharaya's Krida-bhiramamu mentions an image of Kakatamma (""Mother Kakati"") in the Kakatiya capital Orugallu. The 16th century Shitap Khan inscription mentions the reinstallation of the image of goddess Jaganmatruka (mother of the universe) and the lotus seat of the Kakatirajya, which had been destroyed by the Turushkas (Turkic people). [17] According to one theory, Kakati was originally a Jain goddess (possibly Padmavati ) and later came to be regarded as a form of Durga. [14]
The Bayyaram tank inscription from the reign of Ganapati-deva states that the Kakatiya chief Venna (c. 9th century) resided at Kakati, because of which his descendants came to be known as Kakatishas (""lords of Kakati""). [18] Ganapati-deva's Garavapadu charter traces the family's ancestry to Durjaya , a legendary chieftain of ancient Andhra, arrived at a town called Kakati during a hunting expedition, and set up his camp there. [16] The modern identity of Kakati is uncertain: different historians have variously attempted to identify it with modern Kakati village in Karnataka and Kanker in Chhattisgarh . Siddheshvara-Charitra, a later literary work, states that the ancestors of the Kakatiya family lived at Kandarapura (identified with modern Kandhar in Maharashtra ). However, no other evidence supports this tradition. [19] Later, the Kakatiya capital Orugallu (present-day Warangal) was also called ""Kakati-pura"" (""Kakati town""), as attested by some inscriptions of the dynasty. [15]

Much of the information about the Kakatiya period comes from inscriptions, including around 1,000 stone inscriptions, and 12 copper-plate inscriptions. [20] Most of these inscriptions document matters relating to religion, such as donations to Hindu temples. They are particularly abundant for the period 1175–1324 CE, which is the period when the dynasty most flourished and are a reflection of that. The probability is that many inscriptions have been lost due to buildings falling into disuse and also the ravages of subsequent rulers, most notably the Muslim Mughal Empire in the Telangana region. Inscriptions are still being discovered today but governmental agencies tend to concentrate on recording those that are already known rather than searching for new examples. [21] A 1978 book written by P.V.P. Sastry on the history of the Kakatiyas, published by the Government of Andhra Pradesh also constitutes one of the sources. Tamil stone inscription from Kakatiya king Prataparudra was found in Motupalli , Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh. [22]
Information about the Kakatiya period also comes from Sanskrit and Telugu literary works written during Kakatiya and post-Kakatiya period. The most notable among these works include Prataparudriyam, Krida-bhiramamu, Panditaradhya-charitamu, Sivayogasaramu, Nitisara, Niti-sastra-muktavali, Nrutya-ratnavali, Pratapa-charita, Siddhesvara-charitra, Somadeva-rajiyamu, Palnativira-charitra, Velugotivari-vamsavali, and Velugotivari-vamsacharitra. [23] Chronicles by Muslim authors such as Isami and Firishta describe Prataparudra's defeats against the Muslim armies. The Kannada text Kumara-Ramana-charita also provides information about Prataparudra's relations with the Kampili kingdom . [24]
Besides epigraphs and literature, the forts, temples and tanks constructed during the Kakatiya period are an important source of information about contemporary society, art and architecture. [25]
History
Origin
The Kakatiya rulers traced their ancestry to a legendary chief or ruler named Durjaya . [16] Many other ruling dynasties of Andhra also claimed descent from Durjaya. Nothing further is known about this chief. [26]
Most of the Kakatiya records do not mention the Varna (social class) of the family, but the majority of the ones that do, proudly describe them as Shudra . [27] Examples include the Bothpur and Vaddamanu inscriptions of Ganapati's general Malyala Gunda senani. The Kakatiyas also maintained marital relations with other Shudra families, such as the Kotas and the Natavadi chiefs. All this evidence indicates that the Kakatiyas were of Shudra origin. [28]
A few copper-plate inscriptions of the Kakatiya family describe them as belonging to the Kshatriya (warrior) varna. These inscriptions primarily document grants to Brahmans , and appear to be inspired by the genealogies of the Imperial Cholas . [27] For example, the Motupalli inscription of Ganapati counts legendary solar dynasty kings such as Rama among the ancestors of Durjaya, the progenitor of the Kakatiya family. The Malkapuram inscription of Visvesvara Sivacharya, the preceptor of Kakatiya rulers Ganapati-deva and Rudrama-devi, also connects the Kakatiyas to the solar dynasty (Sūryavaṃsa). [29] The term ""Kshatriya"" in these panegyric records appears to signify the family's warrior-like qualities rather than their actual varna. [30]
Relationship to the Rashtrakutas
Kubera, Hoysala-Kakatiya period, 1100-1350 CE.
According to an interpretation of the Mangallu and the Bayyaram inscriptions, the Kakatiyas were not just Rashtrakuta vassals, but also a branch of the Rashtrakuta family. [31]
The 956 CE Mangallu inscription was issued by the Vengi Chalukya prince Dānārnava, at the request of the Kakatiya chief Gunda IV . [32] The inscription names Gundyana's ancestors as Gundiya-Rashtrakuta ( Gunda III ) and Eriya-Rashtrakuta ( Erra ). [33] This suggests that Gunda IV was a Rashtrakuta general, and not a Vengi Chalukya subordinate, as assumed by some earlier historians. [33]
The Bayyaram tank inscription, which records the construction of the Dharma-kirti-samudra tank by Ganapati's sister Mailama (or Mailamba), provides another genealogical list. [34] The similarities of names mentioned in the Mangallu and Bayyaram inscriptions lists suggest that both of these refer to the same family: [35]

The significance of the suffix ""Rashtrakuta"" in the names of the early Kakatiya chiefs is debated. According to one theory, the suffix only implies that these chiefs were Rashtrakuta's subordinates. This theory is based on the fact that the phrase Rashtrakuta-kutumbinah appears in several Rashtrakuta-era copper-plate inscriptions, and refers to the officers and subjects of the Rashtrakuta kingdom. [37]
According to another theory, the suffix implies that the Kakatiyas were a branch of the Rashtrakuta family because the term Rashtrakuta-kutumbinah was used for officers employed by the Rashtrakuta administration, not feudatory chiefs: the early records of the Kakatiya chiefs describe them as samantas (feudatory chiefs). [38] The Kazipet Darga inscription of Durgaraja states that his father Beta II was born in the family of Samanta Viṣṭi. [39] Historian P.V.P. Sastry theorises that ""Viṣṭi"" is a corruption of Vrishni , the name of a clan from which some Rashtrakutas claimed descent. He notes that some chiefs of Rashtrakuta origin adopted the title ""Viṭṭi-narayana"", which means ""as great as Narayana ( Krishna ) of the Vitti (Vrishni) family. [40] Sastry further proposes that the term ""Voddi"", which appears in the phrase Voddi-kula (""Voddi family"") in the Mangallu inscription may be same as ""Viṣṭi"". [41] Sastry also believes that the early Kakatiya chiefs followed Jainism , which was also patronized by the Rashtrakutas, thus strengthening the view that the two dynasties were connected (see Religion section below). [14]
The Kakatiyas seemed to have adopted the mythical bird Garuda as their royal insignia, as attested by the Ekamranatha temple inscription of Ganapati-deva, the Palampet inscription of the Kakatiya general Recharla Rudra , and Vidyanatha's Prataparudriya. [39] The Bayyaram tank inscription calls the Kakatiya chief Beta I (son of Gunda IV) Garudamka-Beta, and ""Garuda"" here appears to refer to the family's emblem. [42] In Hindu mythology, Garuda is the vahana of god Vishnu . The Rashtrakutas and some other dynasties of Deccan claimed descent from the Vrishni clan (associated with Vishnu's avatar Krishna ) and had adopted Garuda as their royal insignia. [38] According to Sastry, this corroborates the theory that the Kakatiyas were associated with the Rashtrakuta family. [5] Sastry further speculates that the Kakatiyas may have adopted the Garuda symbol because of Jain influence: the yaksha of the Jain tirthankara Shantinatha is represented by the Garuda symbol. [5] However, when the Kakatiyas switched their allegiance to the Chalukyas of Kalyani , they also adopted the varaha symbol used by the Chalukyas. [43]
Based on Ganapati-deva's Garavapadu inscription, which names Karikala Chola among the family's ancestors, epigraphist C.R.K. Charlu theorised that the Kakatiyas were a branch of the Telugu Chodas . However, no other Kakatiya record mentions Karikala, and unlike the Telugu Chodas, the Kakatiyas did not claim to belong to the Kashyapa - gotra . Therefore, Sastry dismisses Charlu's theory as untenable. [41]
Early feudatory chiefs
The regnal years of the early members of the Kakatiya family are not certain. The earliest known Kakatiya chief is Venna or Vanna (r. c. 800-815), who claimed descent from Durjaya ,  legendary chieftain of ancient Andhra. According to Kakatiya inscriptions, he ruled from a town called Kakati, because of which his family was called Kakatishas (""lords of Kakati""). Not much is known about his successors Gunda I and Gunda II, who ruled during c. 815-865 CE. [44] The Bayyaram tank inscription compares his successors - Gunda I, Gunda II, and Gunda III - to the three Ramas ( Parashurama , Dasharatha-Rama , and Balarama ).
The c. 956 CE Mangallu inscription suggests that the Kakatiyas came to the Telugu -speaking region as commanders of the Rashtrakuta armies. [15] The earliest of these was Venna's son Gunda III , who died during Krishna II 's invasion of the Vengi Chalukya kingdom around 895 CE. [45] Krishna II captured the Kurravadi (possibly present-day Kuravi ) region from the Vengi Chalukyas, and probably appointed Gunda III's son Erra as a governor there. Not much is known about Erra's son Betiya. [46]
As a Rashtrakuta vassal, Betiya's son Gunda IV (r. c. 955-995) helped the Vengi Chalukya prince Danarnava ascend the throne after a succession dispute. In 973 CE, after the collapse of the Rashtrakuta empire and the murder of Danarnava, he attempted to carve out an independent principality at Kuravi . The Mudugonda Chalukyas, whom he had displaced from Kuravi, sought help from the Kalyani Chalukyas , who had usurped the power from the Rashtrakutas. The Kalyani Chalukya forces probably defeated and killed Gunda IV. [47] His son Beta I (r. c. 1000-1052 CE) accepted the Kalyani Chalukya suzerainty and received from them the fief of Anumakonda (modern Hanamakonda), which later became the Kakatiya capital. He distinguished himself in the Chalukya campaigns against the Cholas, during the reign of Someshvara I . [48]
Prola I (r. c. 1052-1076), the son of Beta I, participated in various Chalukya military campaigns, consolidated the Kakatiya control around Anumakonda by defeating local chiefs, and obtained Anumakonda as a hereditary fief. [49] [50] The Chalukya king granted his son Beta II (r. c. 996-1051) the Sabbi-1000 province (the historical Sabbi-nadu region with 1000 villages, centred around Vemulavada ). [51] He was succeeded by his sons, first Durga-raja  and then Prola II (r. c. 1116–1157). [52]
After the decline of the Rashtrakuta power, the Kakatiyas served as vassals of the Kalyani Chalukyas . After the decline of the Chalukya power in the 12th century, they assumed sovereignty by suppressing other Chalukya subordinates in the Telangana region. [53]

The 1149 Sanigaram inscription of Prola II is the last known record of the Kakatiyas as vassals. The 1163 Anumakonda inscription of Rudradeva alias Prataparudra I is the earliest known record that describes the Kakatiyas as a sovereign power. [56]
According to Sastry, Prataparudra I reigned between around 1158 – 1195, [52] while Sircar gives the dates 1163–1195. He was also known as Rudra Deva, Kakatiya Rudradeva, Venkata, and Venkataraya [12] [57] He was the son of Prola II, who had made efforts to assert greater Kakatiya influence on territories in the eastern parts of the declining Western Chalukyan empire and who died in a battle fought against the Velanati Choda ruler Gonka II around 1157/1158 while doing so. [58] [59] It was during Prataparudra's reign, in 1163, that the Kakatiyas declared an end to their status as feudatory chiefs of the Chalukyas. [d] It is notable that inscriptions were henceforth written using the Kakatiya chiefs' vernacular Telugu rather than the Kannada language that had prevailed until that point. [60]
Mahadeva succeeded Prataparudra I as king, reigning probably from 1195 to 1199. [52]
Ganapati
Just as the Yadava and Hoysala dynasties took control of linguistically related areas during the 13th century, so too did the Kakatiyas under the rule of Ganapati. [60] He is also known as Ganapathi Deva and, according to Sastry, reigned between 1199 and 1262; Sircar gives regnal dates of 1199–1260. [52] [57] He significantly expanded Kakatiya lands during the 1230s when he launched a series of attacks outside the dynasty's traditional Telangana region and thus brought under Kakatiya control the Telugu-speaking lowland delta areas around the Godavari and Krishna rivers. The outcome in the case of all three dynasties, says historian Richard Eaton, was that they ""catalysed processes of supralocal identity formation and community building"". [60]
The Kakatiya capital at Orugallu, established in 1195, was not forgotten while Ganapati expanded his territory. He organised the building of a massive granite wall around the city, complete with ramps designed for ease of access to its ramparts from within. A moat and numerous bastions were also constructed. [61]
Ganapati was keen to bolster the dynasty's economy. He encouraged merchants to trade abroad, abolishing all taxes except for a fixed duty and supporting those who risked their lives to travel afar. [62] He created the man-made Pakhal Lake .
Rudrama Devi

Rudrama Devi , also known as Rudramadevi, reigned around 1262–1289 CE (alternative dates: 1261–1295 CE) and is one of the few queens in Indian history. [52] [63] [64] Sources disagree regarding whether she was the widow of Ganapati or his daughter. [65]
Marco Polo , who visited India probably sometime around 1289–1293, made note of Rudrama Devi's rule and nature in flattering terms. [66] [e] She continued the planned fortification of the capital, raising the height of Ganapati's wall as well as adding a second earthen curtain wall 1.5 miles (2.4 km) in diameter and with an additional 150 feet (46 m)-wide moat. [61]
A fragmentary Kannada language inscription also states that the Kakatiya general Bhairava defeated the Yadava army probably in or after 1263 CE, which may be a reference to his repulsion of Mahadeva 's invasion. A coin of Mahadeva bears the Kakatiya emblem varaha with the Yadava symbols; this varaha may have been stuck on Mahadeva's coins to mark the Kakatiya victory. [9]
Rudrama was married to Virabhadra, an Eastern Chalukyan prince of Nidadavolu who had been selected for that purpose by her father. [67] Having no son as an heir, [61] Rudrama abdicated in favour of her grandson when it became apparent that the expansionist sultan Alauddin Khalji was encroaching on the Deccan and might in due course attack the Kakatiyas. [65]
Prataparudra II
The earliest biography of Rudrama Devi's successor, Prataparudra II , is the Prataparudra Caritramu, dating from the 16th century. [68] His reign began in 1289 (alternative date: 1295) and ended with the demise of the dynasty in 1323. [52] [64] It is described by Eaton as the ""first chapter in a larger story"" that saw the style of polity in the Deccan change from being regional kingdoms to transregional sultanates that survived until the arrival of the British East India Company in the 18th century. [69]
Decline

The Kakatiya kingdom attracted the attention of the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji because of the possibility of plunder. [70] The first foray into the Kakatiya kingdom was made in 1303 by Malik Chajju, the nephew of the Indian Muslim Wazir Nusrat Khan Jalesari of Delhi, and Fakhruddin Jauna , [71] [72] which was a disaster due to the resistance of the Kakatiya army in the Battle of Upparapalli . [73] [f] In 1309 the Gujarati general, Malik Kafur , [74] in an attempt to force Prataparudra into acceptance of a position subordinate to the sultanate at Delhi. Kafur organised a month-long siege of Orugallu that ended with success in February 1310. Prataparudra was forced to make various symbolic acts of obeisance designed to demonstrate his new position as a subordinate but, as was Alauddin's plan, he was not removed as ruler of the area but rather forced thereafter to pay annual tribute to Delhi. [75] It was probably at this time that the Koh-i-Noor diamond passed from Kakatiya ownership to that of Alauddin, along with 20,000 horses and 100 elephants. [70]
In 1311, Prataparudra formed a part of the sultanate forces that attacked the Pandyan empire in the south, and he took advantage of that situation to quell some of his vassals in Nellore who had seen his reduced status as an opportunity for independence. Later, though, in 1318, he failed to provide the annual tribute to Delhi, claiming that the potential for being attacked on the journey made it impossible. The succeeding Sultan Mubarak Shah responded by sending another of his Gujarati generals, Khusrau Khan , [76] to Orugallu with a force that bristled with technology previously unknown in the area, including trebuchet -like machines. Prataparudra had to submit once more , with his obeisance on this occasion being arranged by the sultanate to include a very public display whereby he bowed towards Delhi from the ramparts of Orugallu. The amount of his annual tribute was changed, becoming 100 elephants and 12,000 horses. [77]
The new arrangements did not last long. Taking advantage of a revolution in Delhi that saw the Khalji dynasty removed and the Punjab-born Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq installed as sultan, [78] Prataparudra again asserted his independence in 1320. Tughlaq sent his son, Jauna Khan , to defeat the defiant Kakatiya king in 1321. Khan's army was riven with internal dissension due to rumours of the king's death, which caused many officers to leave the army. [79] This caused the siege on this occasion to last much longer — six months, rather than the few weeks that had previously been the case. The attackers were initially repulsed and Khan's forces retreated to regroup in Devagiri. Prataparudra celebrated the apparent victory by opening up his grain stores for public feasting. Khan returned in 1323 with his revitalised and reinforced army and, with few supplies left, Prataparudra was forced into submission after a five-month siege. The unprepared and battle-weary army of Orugallu was finally defeated, and Orugallu was renamed Sultanpur. It seems probable, from combining various contemporary and near-contemporary accounts, that Prataparudra committed suicide near the Narmada River while being taken as a prisoner to Delhi. [80] [81]
Characterization
Geography
The Kakatiya base was the city of Orugallu [82] in the dry uplands of northern Telangana on the Deccan Plateau . From there they expanded their influence into Coastal Andhra , the delta between the Godavari and Krishna rivers that feed into the Bay of Bengal . According to Rao and Shulman, the latter contained a high proportion of Brahmins while the former was the haunt of ""peasants, artisans and warriors"". [83] Under the Kakatiyas, cultural innovation often began in the uplands, was refined in the lowlands and then recycled back into the Deccan. This bi-directional flow of cultural influences brought into being a feeling of cultural affinity between those who spoke the Telugu language where nothing of that nature had previously existed. [g] The unification of the distinct upland and lowland cultures was their most significant political achievement, achieved through a process of binding many locally powerful figures in allegiance to the empire. [82]
The area of land under Kakatiya control reached its zenith around the 13th century CE during the rule of Ganapati Deva. By this time, South India and the Deccan were essentially under the aegis of four Hindu monarchies , of which the Kakatiyas were one. [h] The four dynasties were in a constant state of warfare with each other, with the Kakatiyas eventually exercising control from close to Anagondi in the west to Kalyani in the north-east, and down to Kanei and Ganjam district in southern Orissa . [7]
Architecture
13th century Ramappa Temple in Telangana .
A notable trend during the dynastic period was the construction of reservoirs for irrigation in the uplands, around 5000 of which were built by warrior families subordinate to the Kakatiyas. This dramatically altered the possibilities for development in the sparsely populated dry areas. Many of these edifices, often called ""tanks"", including the large examples at Pakala and Ramappa, are still used today. [84]
Another notable architectural feature of the dynasty relates to temples. Even before the arrival of the dynasty, there were large, well-established and well-endowed Hindu places of worship in the relatively populous delta areas; however, the temples of the uplands, which were smaller and less cosmopolitan in origin and funding, did not exist until the Kakatiya period. In the lowlands, where Brahmins were numerous, the temples had long benefited from a desire to build social networks for the purposes of domestic and foreign trade, as well as for obtaining grazing rights in the face of competition; in the uplands, the endowment of the buildings was often associated with the construction and continued maintenance of reservoirs and enabled a different type of networking based on political hierarchies. The strengthening of those hierarchies, which was achieved in part by donating land for the temples and then attending worship, was necessary as the inland agrarian society grew rapidly in number and location. [85]
Society
There is a disparity between the analysis of inscriptions, of which the work of Cynthia Talbot has been in the vanguard and the traditional works of Vedic Hinduism that described pre-colonial India in terms of a reverent and static society that was subject to the strictures of the caste system . Colonial British administrators found much that appealed to them in the latter works but the Kakatiya inscriptions of Andhra Pradesh, which depict a far wider range of society and events, suggest that the reality was far more fluid and very different from the idealised image. [86]
Caste itself seems to have been of low importance as a social identifier. [87] There was a lack of consistency regarding the varna rank of Kakatiyas. In most of their inscriptions, no varna affiliation was specified. In the case of a few where it was specified, they were mostly recorded to have been Kshatriyas. A handful of the inscriptions however tried to portray them as Kshatriyas. [i] Anyone, regardless of birth, could acquire the nayaka title to denote warrior statusKshatriy and this they did. There is also little evidence that Kakatiya society paid much regard to caste identities, in the sense of jāti . Although occupation does appear to have been an important designator of social position, the inscriptions suggest that people were not bound to an occupation by birth. [88] [89]
The population became more settled in geographic terms. The growth of an agricultural peasant class subsumed many tribal people who previously had been nomadic.  The nexus of politics and military was a significant feature of the era, and the Kakatiya recruitment of peasants into the military did much to create a new warrior class, develop social mobility and to extend the influence of the dynasty into areas of its kingdom that previously would have been untouched. [90] The Kakatiya kings, and in particular the last two, encouraged an egalitarian ethos. The entrenched landed nobility that had existed before the dynasty found its power to be on the wane; the royal gifting of lands formerly in the possession of nobles to people of lesser status did much to effect this dilution. [68]
Religion
Historian P.V.P. Sastry theorizes that the early Kakatiya chiefs were followers of Jainism . A story in the Siddhesvara-charita states that Madhavavarman, an ancestor of the Kakatiyas, obtained military strength by the grace of goddess Padmakshi . The 1123 Govindapuram Jain inscription of Polavasa, another family of feudatory chiefs, contains a similar account of how their ancestor Madhavavarman obtained military strength by the grace of the Jain goddess Yakshesvari. [91]
According to tradition, Prola II became a Veerahaivite , initiated by the Kalamukha preceptor Ramesvara Panditabefor and established Shaivism as his family's religion. The Shaivism-affiliated personal names of the later Kakatiya kings (such as Rudra, Mahadeva, Harihara, and Ganapati) also indicate a shift towards Shaivism. This, according to Sastry, strengthens the theory that the early Kakatiya chiefs were Jains. [5]

Diocese - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese,"Certain Lutheran denominations such as the Church of Sweden do have individual dioceses similar to Roman Catholics. These dioceses and archdioceses are under the government of a bishop (see Archbishop of Uppsala ). [14] Other Lutheran bodies and synods that have dioceses and bishops include the Church of Denmark , the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland , the Evangelical Church in Germany (partially), and the Church of Norway . [15]
From about the 13th century until the German mediatization of 1803, the majority of the bishops of the Holy Roman Empire were prince-bishops , and as such exercised political authority over a principality, their so-called Hochstift , which was distinct, and usually considerably smaller than their diocese, over which they only exercised the usual authority of a bishop.
Some American Lutheran church bodies such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America have a bishop acting as the head of the synod, [16] but the synod does not have dioceses and archdioceses as the churches listed above. Rather, it is divided into a middle judicatory . [17]
The Lutheran Church - International , based in Springfield, Illinois , presently uses a traditional diocesan structure, with four dioceses in North America. Its current president is Archbishop Robert W. Hotes. [18]
Church of God in Christ
[ edit ]
The Church of God in Christ (COGIC) has dioceses throughout the United States. In the COGIC, most states are divided into at least three or more dioceses that are each led by a bishop (sometimes called a ""state bishop""); some states have as many as ten dioceses. These dioceses are called ""jurisdictions"" within COGIC. [19] [20]
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , the term ""bishopric"" is used to describe the bishop together with his two counselors, not the ward or congregation of which a bishop has charge.
Catharism
[ edit ]
An organization created by the Gnostic group known as the Cathars in 1167 called the Council of Saint-Félix organized Cathar communities into bishoprics, which each had a bishop presiding over a specific division, even though there was no central authority. [21]
Churches that have bishops, but not dioceses
See also: Methodist Circuit and Episcopal area (United Methodist Church)
In the United Methodist Church (the United States and some other countries), a bishop is given oversight over a geographical area called an episcopal area .  Each episcopal area contains one or more annual conferences , which is how the churches and clergy under the bishop's supervision are organized.  Thus, the use of the term ""diocese"" referring to geography is the most equivalent in the United Methodist Church, whereas each annual conference is part of one episcopal area (though that area may contain more than one conference).  The African Methodist Episcopal Church has a similar structure to the United Methodist Church, also using the Episcopal Area. The bishops govern the church as a single bench.[ citation needed ]
In the British Methodist Church and Irish Methodist Church , the closest equivalent to a diocese is the 'circuit' . Each local church belongs to a circuit, and the circuit is overseen by a superintendent minister who has pastoral charge of all the circuit churches (though in practice he or she delegates such charge to other presbyters who each care for a section of the circuit and chair the local church meetings as deputies of the superintendent). This echoes the practice of the early church where the bishop was supported by a bench of presbyters. Circuits are grouped together to form Districts. All of these, combined with the local membership of the Church, are referred to as the ""Connexion"". This 18th-century term, endorsed by John Wesley , describes how people serving in different geographical centres are 'connected' to each other. Personal oversight of the Methodist Church is exercised by the President of the Conference, a presbyter elected to serve for a year by the Methodist Conference; such oversight is shared with the vice-president, who is always a deacon or layperson. Each District is headed by a 'Chair', a presbyter who oversees the district. Although the district is similar in size to a diocese, and Chairs meet regularly with their partner bishops, the Methodist superintendent is closer to the bishop in function than is the chair. The purpose of the district is to resource the circuits; it has no function otherwise.[ citation needed ]
Churches that have neither bishops nor dioceses
[ edit ]
Many churches worldwide have neither bishops nor dioceses. Most of these churches are descended from the Protestant Reformation and more specifically the Swiss Reformation led by John Calvin .[ citation needed ]
Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government , which is governed by representative assemblies of elders.  The Church of Scotland is governed solely through presbyteries , at parish and regional level, and therefore has no dioceses or bishops. [22]
Congregational churches practice congregationalist church governance , in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs.[ citation needed ]
Churches of Christ , being strictly non-denominational , are governed solely at the congregational level.
Most Baptists hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control. [23] Most Baptists believe in ""Two offices of the church""—pastor-elder and deacon—based on certain scriptures ( 1 Timothy 3:1–13 ; Titus 1–2 ).  Exceptions to this local form of local governance include a few churches that submit to the leadership of a body of elders , as well as the Episcopal Baptists that have an Episcopal system .[ citation needed ]
Continental Reformed churches are ruled by assemblies of ""elders"" or ordained officers. This is usually called Synodal government by the continental Reformed, but is essentially the same as presbyterian polity .[ citation needed ]

Wildlife of India
e
India is one of the most biodiverse regions and is home to a large variety of wildlife. It is one of the 17 megadiverse countries and includes three of the world's 36 biodiversity hotspots – the Western Ghats , the Eastern Himalayas , and the Indo-Burma hotspot. [1] [2]
About 24.6% of the total land area is covered by forests. It has various ecosystems ranging from the high altitude Himalayas , tropical evergreen forests along the Western Ghats, desert in the north-west, coastal plains and mangroves along the peninsular region. India lies within the Indomalayan realm and is home to about 7.6% of mammal , 14.7% of amphibian , 6% of bird , 6.2% of reptilian , and 6.2% of flowering plant species.
Human encroachment, deforestation and poaching are significant challenges that threaten the existence of certain fauna and flora. Government of India established a system of national parks and protected areas in 1935, which have been subsequently expanded to nearly 1022 protected areas by 2023. India has enacted the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and special projects such as Project Tiger , Project Elephant and Project Dolphin for protection of critical species.
Fauna
Main article: Fauna of India
Indian elephant , the largest animal species in India
India has an estimated 92,873 species of fauna, roughly about 7.5% of the species available worldwide. [3] [4] Insects form the major category with 63423 recorded species. India is home to 423 mammals , 1233 birds , 526 reptiles , 342 amphibians , 3022 fish apart from other species which form 7.6% of mammal, 14.7% of amphibian, 6% of bird, 6.2% of reptilian species worldwide. [3] [5] Among Indian species, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are endemic, contrasting with 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians. [5]
The Indian subcontinent was formerly an island landmass ( Insular India ) that split away from Gondwana around 125 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous . [6] Late Cretaceous Insular Indian faunas were very similar to those found on Madagascar due to their shared connection until around 90 million years ago. [7] The Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event around 66 million years ago caused the extinction of many animals native to Insular India, such as its titanosaurian and abelisaurid dinosaurs. [8] During the early Cenozoic era , around 55-50 million years ago, the Indian subcontinent collided with Laurasia , allowing animals from Asia to migrate into the Indian subcontinent. Some elements of India's modern fauna, such as the frog family Nasikabatrachidae and the caecillian family Chikilidae , are suggested to have been present in India prior to its collision with Asia. [6]
Four species of megafauna (large animals) native to India became extinct during the Late Pleistocene around 10,000-50,000 years ago as part of a global wave of megafauna extinctions , these include the very large elephant Palaeoloxodon namadicus (possibly the largest land mammal to have ever lived), the elephant relative Stegodon , the hippopotamus Hexaprotodon , and the equine Equus namadicus . These extinctions are thought to have been after the arrival of modern humans on the Indian subcontinent. Ostriches were also formerly native to India, but also became extinct during the Late Pleistocene. [9] [10]

Garrison information
Bahmani Sultanate , Golconda Sultanate , Mughal Empire
Golconda is a fortified citadel and ruined city located on the western outskirts of Hyderabad , Telangana , India. [1] [2] The fort was originally built by Kakatiya ruler Pratāparudra in the 11th century out of mud walls. [3] It was ceded to the Bahmani Kings from Musunuri Nayakas during the reign of the Bahmani Sultan Mohammed Shah I , during the first Bahmani-Vijayanagar War . Following the death of Sultan Mahmood Shah, the Sultanate disintegrated and Sultan Quli, who had been appointed as the Governor of Hyderabad by the Bahmani Kings, fortified the city and made it the capital of the Golconda Sultanate . Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine , Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds known as Golconda Diamonds . Golconda fort is currently abandoned and in ruins. The complex was put by UNESCO on its ""tentative list"" to become a World Heritage Site in 2014, with other forts in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there being a number of different sultanates). [1]
History
Ruins of the fort
View of the Baradari at the Golconda Fort
The origins of the Golconda fort can be traced back to the 11th century. It was originally a small mud fort built by Pratāparudra of the Kakatiya Empire . [3] The name Golconda is thought to originate from the Telugu గొల్ల కొండ Golla koṇḍa for ""Shepherd's hill"". [4] [5] It is also thought that Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva 1199–1262 built a stone hilltop outpost — later known as Golconda fort — to defend their western region. [6] The fort was later developed into a fortified citadel in 1518 by Sultan Quli of the Qutb Shahi Empire and the city was declared the capital of the Golconda Sultanate . [5]
The Bahmani kings took possession of the fort after it was made over to them by means of a sanad by the Rajah of Warangal . [3] Under the Bahmani Sultanate , Golconda slowly rose to prominence. Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk (r. 1487–1543), sent by the Bahmanids as a governor at Golconda, established the city as the seat of his governance around 1501. Bahmani rule gradually weakened during this period, and Sultan Quli (Quli Qutub Shah period) formally became independent in 1518, establishing the Qutb Shahi dynasty based in Golconda. [7] [8] [9] Over a period of 62 years, the mud fort was expanded by the first three Qutb Shahi sultans into the present structure: a massive fortification of granite extending around 5 km (3.1 mi) in circumference . It remained the capital of the Qutb Shahi dynasty until 1590 when the capital was shifted to Hyderabad . The Qutb Shahis expanded the fort, whose 7 km (4.3 mi) outer wall enclosed the city.
During the early seventeenth century a strong cotton-weaving industry existed in Golconda. Large quantities of cotton were produced for domestic and exports consumption. High quality plain or patterned cloth made of muslin and calico was produced. Plain cloth was available as white or brown colour, in bleached or dyed variety. Exports of this cloth was to Persia and European countries. Patterned cloth was made of prints which were made indigenously with indigo for blue, chay-root for red coloured prints and vegetable yellow. Patterned cloth exports were mainly to Java, Sumatra and other eastern countries. [10] The fort finally fell into ruin in 1687 after an eight-month-long siege led to its fall at the hands of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb , who ended the Qutb Shahi reign and took the last Golconda king, Abul Hassan Tana Shah , captive. [11] [5]
Diamonds
[ edit ]
The Golconda fort used to have a vault where the famous Koh-i-Noor and Hope diamonds were once stored along with other diamonds. [12]
Golconda is renowned for the diamonds found on the south-east at Kollur Mine near Kollur, Guntur district , Paritala and Atkur in Krishna district and cut in the city during the Kakatiya reign . At that time , India had the only known diamond mines in the world. Golconda was the market city of the diamond trade, and gems sold there came from a number of mines. The fortress-city within the walls was famous for diamond trade.[ citation needed ]
Its name has taken a generic meaning and has come to be associated with great wealth. Some gemologists use this classification to denote the extremely rare Type IIa diamond, a crystal that essentially lacks nitrogen impurities and is therefore colorless; Many Type IIa diamonds, as identified by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), have come from the mines in and around the Golconda region.
Many famed diamonds are believed to have been excavated from the mines of Golconda, such as:

State in southern India
Not to be confused with the Malaysian state of Terengganu .
State in South India, India
Telangana
Location of Telangana in India
Coordinates:
112,077 km2 (43,273 sq mi)
• Rank
Urdu: [ˈtɪləŋɡɑːna] ⓘ ) is a state in India situated in the south-central part of the Indian subcontinent on the high Deccan Plateau . [14] It is the eleventh largest state and the twelfth most populated state in India as per the 2011 census . [15] On 2 June 2014, the area was separated from the northwestern part of United Andhra Pradesh as the newly formed state of Telangana , with Hyderabad as its capital. Telugu , one of the classical languages of India , is the most widely spoken and the primary official language of the state.
The economy of Telangana is the ninth-largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹16.502 trillion (US$190 billion) and has a GSDP per capita of ₹390,564 (US$4,500) for the financial year 2024–25. [16] [17] Telangana scored 0.705 on the Human Development Index during 2017–2018. [11]
The state has emerged as a major focal point for IT software companies, industry and the services sector . The state is also the main administrative center of many Indian defence aerospace and research labs including Bharat Dynamics Limited , Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory , Defence Research and Development Organisation and Defence Research and Development Laboratory . [18]
Etymology
[ edit ]
One popular etymology derives the word ""Telangana"" from Trilinga desha (""land of three lingas ""), a region named after 3 important Shaivite shrines present in it: Kaleshwaram (present day Telangana), Srisailam and Draksharama (present day Andhra Pradesh ). [19]
According to Jayadheer Tirumala Rao , a scholar of history, the name Telangana is of Gondi origin. Rao asserts that it is derived from ""Telangadh"", which means ""south"" in Gondi and has been referred in ""Gond script dating back to about 2000 years"". [20]
One of the earliest uses of a word similar to Telangana can also be seen in a name of Malik Maqbul Tilangani (14th century CE), who was called the Tilangani, which implies that he was from Telangana. He was the commander of the Warangal Fort (Kataka Pāludu) and later Wazir — Minister under Firuz Shah Tughlaq . [21] [22]
A 16th-century travel writer, Firishta , recorded in his book:
During the just reign of Ibrahim Kootb Shah , Tulingana, like Egypt , became the mart of the whole world. Merchants from Toorkistan, Arabia, and Persia resorted to it; and they met with such encouragement that they found in it inducements to return frequently. The greatest luxuries from foreign parts daily abounded at the king's hospitable board. [23]
The word ""Telinga"" changed over time to ""Telangana"" and the name ""Telangana"" was designated to distinguish the predominantly Telugu-speaking region of the erstwhile Hyderabad State from its predominantly Marathi -speaking one, Marathwada . It is also called ""The land of Telugu people"". After Asaf Jahi 's ceded the Seemandhra region to the British, the rest of the Telugu region retained the name Telangana and the other parts were called Madras Presidency's Circars and Ceded. [24]
History
Main article: History of Telangana
Throughout antiquity and the Middle Ages, the Telangana region was part of multiple Indian empires; such as the Mauryans , Satavahanas , Vishnukundinas , Chalukyas , Cholas , Rashtrakutas , Kakatiyas , Delhi Sultanate , Bahmani Sultanate and Golconda Sultanate . During the 17th-19th centuries, the region was ruled by the Mughals and Nizam of Hyderabad . [25] [26] In 1823, the Nizams ceded Northern Circars —( Coastal Andhra ) and Ceded Districts —( Rayalseema ) to British India under a subsidiary alliance which reduced it to that of a landlocked princely state bounded on all sides by British India.
Following the Indian Independence in 1947 the Hyderabad state joined the Union of India in 1948 after a police action . In 1956, the Hyderabad State was dissolved and its Telugu-speaking region Telangana was merged with the Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh . A peasant-driven movement began to advocate for separation from Andhra Pradesh starting in the early 1950s, and continued until Telangana was granted statehood on 2 June 2014. [27]
The historic city Golconda in Hyderabad established itself as a diamond trading centre, and until the end of the 19th century the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in the world. Thus, the legendary name Golconda Diamonds became synonymous with Golconda itself.

From 230 BCE to 220 CE, the Satavahana dynasty became the dominant power in this area. It originated from the lands between the Godavari and Krishna rivers and was based at Amaravathi and Dharanikota. [28] After the decline of the Satavahanas, various dynasties, such as the Vakataka , Vishnukundina , Chalukya , Rashtrakuta and Western Chalukya , ruled the area. [29]

The Telangana area experienced its golden age during the reign of the Kakatiya dynasty , which ruled most parts of the present-day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana from 1083 to 1323 CE. [29] Rudrama Devi and Prataparudra II were prominent rulers from the Kakatiya dynasty. The dynasty weakened with the attack of Malik Kafur in 1309 and was dissolved after the defeat of Prataparudra by the forces of Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1323. [30] [31]
Golconda Fort
The area came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century, followed by the Bahmani Sultanate . Quli Qutb Mulk , a governor of Golconda, revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty in 1518. On 21 September 1687, the Golconda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after a year-long siege of the Golconda fort. [32]
During the early seventeenth century a strong cotton-weaving industry existed in Telangana. Large quantities of cotton were produced for domestic and exports consumption. High quality plain and patterned cloth made of muslin and calico was produced. [33]
In 1712, Qamar-ud-din Khan was appointed by emperor Farrukhsiyar as the viceroy of Deccan with the title Nizam-ul-Mulk (meaning ""Administrator of the Realm""). He was later recalled to Delhi, with Mubariz Khan appointed as the viceroy. In 1724, Qamar-ud-din Khan defeated Mubariz Khan to reclaim the Deccan suba, establishing it as an autonomous province of the Mughal empire. He took the name Asif Jah, starting what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty . [29] He named the area Hyderabad Deccan . Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were called Asif Jahi Nizams or nizams of Hyderabad . Hyderabad Nizams remained the tributary of marathas after suffering series of defeats paying annual chauth in return for retaining their domain. The Medak and Warangal divisions of Telangana were part of their realm. [34]
Telangana was the seat of numerous dynasties. The Chowmahalla Palace was home to the Nizams of Hyderabad .

When Asif Jah I died in 1748, there was political unrest due to contention for the throne among his sons, who were aided by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. In 1769, Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Nizams. The Nizam Nasir-ud-dawlah, Asaf Jah IV signed the subsidiary alliance with the British in 1799 and lost its control over the state's defence and foreign affairs. Hyderabad State became a princely state among the presidencies and provinces of British India . [34]
In 1787, heavy flooding killed over 20,000 causing a plague which killed about 10,656,000 people in Telangana. [35]
Modern period
[ edit ]
When India became independent from the British Empire in 1947, the Nizam of Hyderabad did not want to merge with the Indian Union and wanted to remain independent. The Government of India annexed Hyderabad State on 17 September 1948 after a military operation called Operation Polo . [29] It appointed a civil servant, M. K. Vellodi , as first chief minister of Hyderabad State on 26 January 1950. [36] He administered the state with the help of English-educated bureaucrats from the Madras and Bombay states, who were familiar with British systems of administration unlike the bureaucrats of Hyderabad State who used a completely different administrative system. The official language of the state was switched from Urdu to English .
In 1952, Dr. Burgula Ramakrishna Rao was elected chief minister of the Hyderabad State in its first democratic election. During this time, there were violent agitations by some Telanganites to send the Madras state bureaucrats back and implement a rule by the natives (mulkis) of Hyderabad (Syed Alam Sharjil) was elected chief minister of Hyderabad after (Dr. Burgula Ramakrishana Rao) for one year after he resigned from the post. [37]
The Telangana Rebellion was a peasant revolt supported by the communists . It originated in the Telangana regions of the Hyderabad State between 1946 and 1951, led by the Communist Party of India (CPI). [38]
The revolt began in the Nalgonda district against the feudal lords of Reddy and Velama castes. It quickly spread to the Warangal and Bidar districts. Peasant farmers and labourers revolted against the local feudal landlords ( jagirdars and deshmukhs ) and later against the Nizam Osman Ali Khan . The violent phase of the movement ended after the government of India's Operation Polo . [39] Starting in 1951, the CPI shifted to a more moderate strategy of seeking to bring communism to India within the framework of Indian democracy. [40]
In December 1953, the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC) was appointed to form states on a linguistic basis. [41] An agreement was reached between Telangana leaders and Andhra leaders on 20 February 1956 to merge Telangana and Andhra with promises to safeguard Telangana's interests. [42] After reorganisation in 1956, the region of Telangana was merged with Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh.
Following this Gentlemen's agreement , the central government established the unified state of Andhra Pradesh on 1 November 1956. [43] [44] [45] G.O 553 of 1959 from the united Andhra Pradesh state moved two revenue divisions of Bhadrachalam from East Godavari and Aswaraopeta from West Godavari to Khammam for administrative convenience.
Main article: Telangana movement
There had been several movements to revoke the merger of Telangana and Andhra, major ones occurring in 1969, 1972, and 2009. The movement for a new state of Telangana gained momentum in the 21st century by an initiative of Kalvakuntla Chandrashekhar Rao from Bharat Rashtra Samithi later joined by the Telangana Political Joint Action Committee (TJAC), including political leadership representing the Telangana area. [46] On 9 December 2009 the government of India announced the process of formation of the Telangana state. Violent protests led by people in the Coastal Andhra and Rayalseema regions occurred immediately after the announcement, and the decision was put on hold on 23 December 2009.
The movement continued in Hyderabad and other districts of Telangana. [47] There were hundreds of claimed suicides, [48] strikes, protests and disturbances to public life demanding separate statehood.

Badrinath is the abode of Lord Vishnu, who is called 'Badri Vishal', Badri the Big One. Legend has it that Badrinath was the abode of Lord Shiva, who used to reside there with his consort Parvati. It is Located in Chamoli District of Uttarakhand . Lord Vishnu happened to like the place and wished to reside there permanently, so He took the form of an infant and started crying inconsolably. Mother Parvati's heart melted and she picked up the infant Vishnu and started cradling Him. The crying of the infant, however, disturbed the meditation of Lord Shiva and unable to bear the crying He left for higher reaches of the Himalayas and made Kedarnath His home. Once Lord Shiva left, Mother Parvati too followed, which gave an opportunity to Lord Vishnu to take His original form and remain at Badrinath forever. The priests of Badrinath are from the southernmost part of India , i.e. Kerala . This is according to the rules laid down by Adi Shankara . Badrinath remains out of bounds for pilgrims for six months a year, from October to May.

Kedarnath is the abode of Lord Shiva. Kedarnath is one of the twelve Jyotirlingams of India and the only one in the Uttarakhand . While there is a motorable road to Badrinath , Kedarnath could only be reached by foot. The 18-kilometre (11 mi) trek begins from Gaurikund . After the 2013 Himalayan floods, the trek currently is of more than 18 km (11 mi) due to washing away of trekking paths.
Gangotri
[ edit ]
Gangotri is the origin of the holy Ganga . Ganga is revered as a mother throughout India. According to the Hindu philosophy , a place considered extremely holy if a river running through it flows in the northern direction. Gangotri is a place which is not only the origin of Ganga but also where Ganga flows in a northerly direction, hence the name Gangotri. The river Ganga flows out from the melting Gangotri glacier, which is at a distance of around 18 km (11 mi) from the Gangotri town. Close to the temple is Bhagirath Shila, which according to the Hindu philosophy is the place where Bhagirath did penance for 5500 years to seek the blessings of Mother Ganga and requested her to descend to the Earth from her heavenly abode to cleanse the sins of his ancestors.
Yamunotri
[ edit ]
Yamunotri is the origin of the holy river Yamuna. A temple dedicated to the holy river Yamuna is situated at the place. The actual origin of the river is the Yamunotri glacier further up into the Himalayas where very few pilgrims go due to the difficulty it entails.

Panch Prayag
e
Panch Prayag ( Sanskrit : पंच-प्रयाग) is an expression in Hindu religious ethos, specifically used to connote the five sacred river confluences in the Garhwal Himalayas in the state of Uttarakhand , India. The five Sanskrit : prayags (meaning 'confluence'; also termed rayag pentad 'five river-confluences'), are, in descending flow sequence of their occurrence: Vishnu Prayag; Nand Prayag; Karn prayag; Rudra Prayag; and Dev Prayag.
Vishnu Prayag
[ edit ]
The Alaknanda River, which originates in the eastern slopes of glacier fields of Chaukhamba , is joined by the Saraswathi River near Mana (that originates on the south from the international border), and then flows in front of the Badrinath temple, one of the most revered Hindu shrines. It then meets the Dhauli Ganges River, whose origin is from the Niti Pass, after traveling a distance of 25 km (15.5 mi) from its source to form the Vishnu Prayag (
30°33′45″N 79°34′31″E﻿ / ﻿30.5626°N 79.5754°E﻿ / 30.5626; 79.5754﻿ (Vishnu Prayag) ). This stretch of the Alaknanda River is called the Vishnu Ganges. Legend narrates the worship offered by sage Narada to god Vishnu at this confluence. An octagonal shaped temple – located near the confluence – dated to 1889, is credited to Maharani of Indore – Ahalyabai. Though originally built to install a Shiva linga , it now houses a Vishnu image. A stairway from this temple leads to the Vishnu kund (kund means pool of water or lake) at the confluence, which is seen in a tranquil state. [20] [21]
Nanda Prayag
[ edit ]
Nand Prayag (
30°19′56″N 79°18′55″E﻿ / ﻿30.3321°N 79.3154°E﻿ / 30.3321; 79.3154﻿ (Nand Prayag) ) is the second prayag in the cascade sequence of the confluences where the Nandakini River joins the main Alaknanda River. According to one tale, a noble King Nanda performed Yagnya (fire-sacrifice) and sought blessings of God. Hence, the confluence is named after him. The other version of the legend states that the confluence derives its name from the Yadava king Nanda , the foster-father of god Krishna . According to the legend, Vishnu granted a boon of the birth of a son to Nanda and his wife Yashoda and also the same boon to Devaki , wife of Vasudeva . Placed in a dilemma, since both were his disciples, he ensured that Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu, was born to Devaki and Vasudeva but was fostered by Yashoda and Nanda. [20] [21] There is temple for Gopal , a form of Krishna, here. [22] The legends also narrate that sage Kanva did penance here and also that the wedding of King Dushyanta and Shakuntala took place at this venue. [23]
Karna Prayag
[ edit ]
Karn Prayag (
30°15′49″N 79°12′56″E﻿ / ﻿30.2637°N 79.2156°E﻿ / 30.2637; 79.2156﻿ (Karn Prayag) ) is the location where Alaknanda River is joined by the Pindar River that originates from the Pindar glacier, below the Nanda Devi hill range. [20] The epic Mahabharata legend narrates that Karna did penance here and earned the protective gear of Kavacha (armour) and Kundala (ear rings) from his father, the Sun god , which gave him indestructible powers. The name of the confluence is thus derived from the name of Karna.[ citation needed ] There is reference to this site in Meghaduta , a Sanskrit lyrical poetic drama written by the legendary poet Kalidasa , which attributes that Satopanth and Bhagirath glaciers joined here to form the Pindar River. Another classic work by the same author called the Abhijnana-shakuntala also mentions that Shakuntala and king Dushyanta's romantic daliance occurred here. [24] It is also mentioned that Swami Vivekananda mediatated here for eighteen days. [21]
The stone seat where Karna did penance is also seen here. A temple built in recent times to commemorate Karna has the deity of goddess Uma Devi (daughter of the Himalayas ) here. The stone temple was rebuilt by guru Adi Shankaracharya . In the sanctum, the images of goddess Parvati , her consort Shiva and her elephant-headed son Ganesha are installed, next to that of Uma Devi, apart from Karna's image. A steep row of steps from the temple along a spur leads to the confluence point. And, down these steps, small shrines of Shiva and the Binayak Shila (the Ganesha stone) – that is believed to provide protection from danger – are located. Once every twelve years, a procession of the image of Uma Devi is taken around a few villages in the sub-divisional town of Karnaprayag.[ citation needed ]
Rudra Prayag
[ edit ]
At Rudra Prayag (
30°17′16″N 78°58′43″E﻿ / ﻿30.2878°N 78.9787°E﻿ / 30.2878; 78.9787﻿ (Rudra Prayag) ) the Alaknanda meets the Mandakini River . The confluence is named after god Shiva, who is also known as Rudra .[ citation needed ] According to a widely narrated legend, Shiva performed the Tandava here, Tandava is a vigorous dance that is the source of the cycle of creation, preservation, and dissolution. Shiva also played his favourite musical instrument the Rudra veena here. By playing the Veena, he enticed god Vishnu to his presence and converted him to water. [21]
Another legend narrates that sage Narada had become conceited by his Veena playing skills. The gods requested Krishna in order to set things right. Krishna told Narada that Shiva and his consort Parvati were impressed by his musical talent. Narada was taken in by the praise and immediately set out to meet Shiva in the Himalayas. On the way at Rudra Prayag, he met several beautiful damsels called raginis (musical notes) who were disfigured and the reason for such disfigurement was squarely attributed to Narada playing his Veena. Hearing this, Narada felt humbled and surrendered before Shiva and decided to devote himself to learning music as disciple of Shiva.[ citation needed ]
According to another legend, the consort of Shiva – Sati was reborn as Parvati as the daughter of Himalaya, after she self-immolated herself in protest of the insult of Shiva. In spite of Himalaya's protests, Parvati performed rigorous penance to get the boon of becoming Shiva's wife in the new birth too.[ citation needed ]
Temples dedicated to Rudranath (Shiva) and goddess Chamunda are located here.
Dev Prayag
[ edit ]
Dev Prayag (
30°08′43″N 78°35′52″E﻿ / ﻿30.1453°N 78.5977°E﻿ / 30.1453; 78.5977﻿ (Dev Prayag) ) is the confluence of the two holy rivers, the Bhagirathi – the chief stream of the Ganges and the Alaknanda. It is the first Prayag on the way to Badrinath. Beyond this confluence, the river is known as Ganges. The holiness of this place is considered equal to the famous Triveni sangam confluence at Allahabad where the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers merge. [21]
The confluence of the Bhagirathi, which flows in rapids with strong currents meets a much calmer river in the Alaknanda and this has been vividly described by the British captain Raper as: [25]
The contrast between the two rivers joining here is striking. The Bhaghirathi runs down a steep declivity with rapid force, roaring and foaming flowing over large fragments placed in its bed, while the placid, Alakananda, flowing, with a smooth, unruffled surface, gently winds round the point till, meeting with her turbulent consort, she is forcibly hurried down, and unites her clamours with the blustering current.
Panch Kedar
[ edit ]
Panch Kedar ( Sanskrit : पंचकेदार) refers to five Hindu temples or holy places of the Shaivite sect dedicated to god Shiva . They are located in the Garhwal Himalayan region in Uttarakhand , India. They are the subject of many legends that directly link their creation to Pandavas , the heroes of the Hindu Indian epic , the Mahabharata . [26]
The five temples designated in the strict pecking order to be followed for pilgrimage for worship are the Kedarnath ( Sanskrit : केदारनाथ) at an altitude of 3,583 m (11,755 ft), the Tungnath (तुंगनाथ)(3,680 m or 12,070 ft), Rudranath (रुद्रनाथ) (2,286 m or 7,500 ft), Madhyamaheshwar (मध्यमहेश्वर) or Madmaheshwar (3,490 m or 11,450 ft) and Kalpeshwar (कल्पेश्वर) (2,200 m or 7,200 ft). The Kedarnath is the main temple, which is part of the four famous Chota Char Dhams (literally 'the small four abodes/seats') or pilgrimage centers of the Garhwal Himalayas; the other three dhams are the Badrinath , Yamunotri and Gangotri . Kedarnath is also one of the twelve Jyotirlingas . [27] [28]
The Garhwal region is also called the Kedar-Khanda after Kedar – the local name for Lord Shiva. The region abounds in emblems and aniconic forms of Shiva sect of Lord Shiva, much more than the Vaishnava sect. The western part of this region in particular, which constitutes half of Chamoli district being known as Kedar-Kshetra or Kedar mandala, encompasses in its ambit all the five temples constituting the Panch Kedar. [29]
Legend of Panch Kedar
[ edit ]
The most famous folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas , the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata . The Pandavas defeated and killed their cousins – the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war . They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide ( gotra hatya ) and Brāhmanahatya (killing of Brahmins – the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of the god Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of Varanasi (Kashi), believed to Shiva's favourite city and known for its Shiva temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull ( Nandi ) and hid in the Garhwal region.
Not finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas . Bhima , the second of the five Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi (""hidden Kashi"" – the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tunganath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar, the face showing up at Rudranath and the hair and the head appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva. The Pandavas were thus freed from their sins. It is also believed that the fore portions of Shiva appeared at Pashupatinath, Kathmandu – the capital of Nepal . [27] [30] [31]
A variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from disappearing. Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas. [30] After building the Panch Kedar temples, the Pandavas mediated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation.[ citation needed ]
After completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar temples, it is an unwritten religious rite to visit Lord Vishnu at the Badrinath Temple , as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Lord Shiva. [32]

Ghat - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghats,"[ edit ]
The word is also used in some places outside the Indian subcontinent. For example, in George Town, Penang , Malaysia , the label ""Ghaut"" is used to identify the extensions of those streets which formerly ended in ghats before the reclamation of the quayside (e.g., Church St Ghaut, in Malay Gat Lebuh Gereja, is the name of the extension of Church St beyond where the street used to descend to the water via a ghat). Both in Penang and Singapore , there are areas named Dhoby Ghaut ( dhobi meaning ""launderer"" or ""laundry"", depending on whether it refers to a person or a business).
Aapravasi Ghat or The Immigration Depot is a building complex located in Port Louis on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius , the first British colony to receive indentured, or contracted, labour workforce from India. [8] From 1849 to 1923, half a million Indian indentured labourers passed through the Immigration Depot, to be transported to plantations throughout the British Empire . The large-scale migration of the laborers left an indelible mark on the societies of many former British colonies, with Indians constituting a substantial proportion of their national populations . [9] In Mauritius alone, 68 percent of the current total population is of Indian ancestry . The Immigration Depot has thus become an important reference point in the history and cultural identity of Mauritius. [10] [11]

Sultanate of Golconda - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutub_Shahi_dynasty,"Toggle the table of contents
Sultanate of Golconda

Capital
Golconda (1519–1591) Hyderabad (1591–1687)
Common languages
The Sultanate of Golconda ( Persian : سلطنت گلکنده; Urdu : سلطنت گولکنڈه) was an early modern kingdom in southern India , ruled by the Persianate , [6] Shia Islamic Qutb Shahi dynasty [a] of Turkoman origin. [7] [8] After the decline of the Bahmani Sultanate , the Sultanate of Golconda was established in 1518 [9] by Quli Qutb Shah , as one of the five Deccan sultanates .
The kingdom extended from parts of the modern-day Indian states of Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , Odisha and Telangana . [10] The Golconda sultanate was constantly in conflict with the Adil Shahis and Nizam Shahis , which it shared borders with in the seventeenth century to the west and northwest. [11] In 1636, Mughal emperor Shah Jahan forced the Qutb Shahis to recognize Mughal suzerainty and pay periodic tributes. The dynasty came to an end in 1687 during the reign of its seventh sultan Abul Hasan Qutb Shah , when the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb arrested and jailed Abul Hasan for the rest of his life in Daulatabad , incorporating Golconda into the Mughal empire. [12] [13] [11]
The Qutb Shahis were patrons of Persianate Shia culture. [13] [14] The official and court language of the Golconda sultanate during the first 90 years of its existence (c. 1518 – 1600) was also Persian. In the early 17th century, however, the Telugu language was elevated to the status of the Persian language, while towards the end of the Qut Shahis' rule, it was the primary court language with Persian used occasionally in official documents. According to Indologist Richard Eaton, as Qutb Shahis adopted Telugu, they started seeing their polity as the Telugu-speaking state, with the elites of the sultanate viewing their rulers as ""Telugu Sultans"". [15]
History
[ edit ]
The dynasty's founder, Sultan Quli Khawas Khan Hamdani was born in Hamadan , Iran. He belonged to the Qara Qoyunlu , a Turkmen Muslim tribe and therefore a descendant of Qara Yusuf . [16] [17] In the 16th century, he migrated to Delhi with his uncle, Allah-Quli, some of his relatives and friends. Later he migrated south, to the Deccan and served the Bahmani sultan , Mahmood Shah Bahmani II , who was of Deccani Muslim ethnicity. [18] [19] He declared the independence of Golconda after the disintegration of the Bahmani Sultanate into the five Deccan sultanates . [19] He took the title Qutb Shah, and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda. He was assassinated in 1543 by his son, Jamsheed , who assumed control of the sultanate. [19] Jamsheed died in 1550 from cancer. [20] Jamsheed's young son Subhan Quli Qutb Shah reigned for a year, at which time the nobility brought back and installed Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah as sultan. [20]
Golconda, and with the construction of the Char Minar , later Hyderabad , served as capitals of the sultanate, [19] and both cities were embellished by the Qutb Shahi sultans. The dynasty ruled Golconda for 171 years, until Aurangzeb , in his campaigns in the Deccan , conquered the Sultanate of Golconda in 1687 with the completion of his siege of Golconda . [21] The sultante's last ruler, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah , was imprisoned in Daulatabad Fort , and the territory of the Golconda Sultanate was made into a Mughal imperial province, Hyderabad Subah . [22] [23]
Economy
Tomb of Sultan Muhammad Qutb Shah in Hyderabad .
The Golconda Sultanate was notoriously wealthy. While its primary source of revenue was a land tax, [24] the sultanate greatly profited from its monopoly on diamond production from mines in the southern districts of the kingdom. The sultanate also had control over the Krishna and Godavari deltas , giving it access to craft production in the villages of the area, where goods like textiles were produced. The town of Masulipatnam served as the Golconda Sultanate's primary seaport for the export of diamonds and textiles. The kingdom reached the peak of its financial prosperity in the 1620s and 1630s. [25] [26]
Diamonds
Main article: Golconda diamonds
Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond first discovered by the Golconda sultanate
The Golconda Sultanate was known for its diamonds which were dubbed the Golconda diamonds . These diamonds were sought after diamonds long before the Qutb Shahi dynasty came to power, and they continued to supply this demand through European traders. [27] Diamonds from mines (especially the Kollur Mine presently in Guntur district , Andhra Pradesh ) were transported to the city of Hyderabad to be cut, polished, evaluated and sold. Golconda established itself as a diamond trading centre and until the end of the 19th century, the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in the world. [28]
Cotton-weaving
[ edit ]
During the early seventeenth century, a strong cotton-weaving industry existed in the Deccan region. Large quantities of cotton cloth were produced for domestic and export consumption. High-quality plain and patterned cloth made of muslin and calico was produced. Plain cloth was available in white or brown colour, in bleached or dyed variety. This cloth was exported to Persia and European countries. The patterned cloth was made of prints which were made indigenously with indigo for blue, chay-root for red coloured prints and vegetable yellow. Patterned cloth exports were mainly to Java, Sumatra and other eastern countries. [29] Golconda had a strong trading relationship with Ayutthaya Siam. [30]
Culture
[ edit ]
Golkonda Painting, 1650-1670 Opaque watercolor and gold on paper Overall
The Qutb Shahis were patrons of Persianate Shia culture. [13] [14] Over the first 90 years of their rule (c. 1518 – 1600), they championed Persian culture. Their official edicts and court language were in Persian only. [15] Quli Qutb Mulk's court became a haven for Persian culture and literature. [11] In early 17th-century, with Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah (1580–1612) a change began. He began to patronize the Telugu language and culture as well. Edicts began to be issued both in Persian and Telugu. Towards the end of the dynasty, these were primarily in Telugu with a summary in Persian. As they adopted Telugu, they saw their territory as the Telugu-speaking region, states Indologist Richard Eaton, with their elites considering the rulers as ""Telugu Sultans"". [15] [31]
Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah (1580–1612) wrote poems in Dakhini Urdu, Persian and Telugu. [14] Subsequent poets and writers, however, wrote in Urdu, while using vocabulary from Persian, Hindi and Telugu languages. [14] During the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah in 1634 AD, an ancient Sanskrit text on love and sex Ratirahasya by Kokkoka was translated into Persian and named Lazzat-un-Nisa (Flavors of the Woman). [32]
Architecture
[ edit ]
The Qutb Shahi architecture was Indo-Islamic , a culmination of Indian and Persian architectural styles. [33] Their style was very similar to that of the other Deccan Sultanates . The Qutb Shahi rulers built the Char Minar . [14]

Design and construction
Architect(s)
William Ward Marrett [2]
Falaknuma is a former palace and currently a luxury hotel in Hyderabad, Telangana , India . [3] [4] It originally belonged to the Paigah family , and was later owned by the Nizam of Hyderabad . [5] It is on a hillock and covers a 13-hectare (32-acre) area in Falaknuma, 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from Charminar .
Built by Nawab Sir Viqar-ul-Umra , Prime Minister of Hyderabad state and the uncle and brother-in-law of the sixth Nizam . [6] Falak-numa means ""Like the Sky"" or ""Mirror of Sky"" in Urdu. [3]
The palace post renovation carried out in 2010 today is a part of Taj Group and has been renamed as Taj Faluknama Palace.
Design
[ edit ]
An English architect William Ward Marret designed the palace. It is made completely with Italian marble with stained-glass windows and covers an area of 93,970 square metres (1,011,500 sq ft).
The palace was built in the shape of a scorpion with two stings spread out as wings in the north. The middle part is occupied by the main building and the kitchen, Gol Bangla, Zenana Mehal, and harem quarters stretch to the south. The Nawab was an avid traveller, and this reflects in the architecture , which combines Italian and Tudor influences.[ citation needed ]
The Palace has a library with a carved walnut roof, a replica of the one at Windsor Castle. The library had one of the finest collection of the Quran in India.  The ground floor of the Palace housed the living quarters.  A marble staircase leads to the upper floor.  It has carved balustrades, which support marble figurines with candelabra at intervals.
One of the highlights of the Palace is the State Reception Room, where the ceiling is decorated with frescoes and gilded reliefs. The Ballroom contains a 2-ton manually-operated organ, said to be the only one of its kind in the world.  The palace has 60 lavishly decorated rooms and 22 spacious halls.  It has some of the finest collections of the Nizam’s treasures, including paintings, statues, furniture, manuscripts and books. The jade collection at the Palace is considered to be unique in the world.[ citation needed ]
History
Falaknuma Palace, photographed by Lala Deen Dayal in 1900.
The entrance to the Palace
Sir Viqar-ul-Umra , the Prime Minister of Hyderabad , after a visit to Europe, decided to build a European styled residence for himself. The foundation stone for the construction was laid by Sir Vicar on 3 March 1884.  It took nine years to complete the construction and furnish the palace. Sir Vicar moved into the Gol Bangla and Zanana Mahel of the Falaknuma Palace in December 1890 and closely monitored the finishing work at the Mardana portion.
He used the palace as his private residence until the palace was handed over to the 6th Nizam of Hyderabad around 1897–1898.
The palace was built and furnished at a cost of ₹ 4 million (equivalent to ₹1.8 billion or US$21 million in 2023), which necessitated borrowing money from the Bank of Bengal . In the spring of 1897, the sixth Nizam of Hyderabad , Mir Mahbub Ali Khan was invited to stay at the palace. He extended his stay to a week, then a fortnight, and then a month, which prompted Sir Viqar to offer it to him. The Nizam accepted but paid some of the value of the palace.
The Nizam used the palace as a guest house for the royal guests visiting the kingdom of Hyderabad. The list of royal visitors included King George V , Queen Mary , Edward VIII and Tsar Nicholas II . [7] [8] The palace fell into disuse after the 1950s. The last important guest was the President of India, Rajendra Prasad , in 1951. [3]
The palace was then restored after being leased by the Taj Group of Hotels . The restoration, which began in 2000, took ten years, and was managed by Princess Esra , the first wife of Mukarram Jah . Now, the hotel is again used to host guests in Hyderabad, such as Aga Khan IV , Ivanka Trump and Narendra Modi .
Palace architecture
[ edit ]
The reception room of the Palace.
One of the highlights of the palace is the state reception room, where the ceiling is decorated with frescoes . The ballroom contains a two-ton manually operated organ said to be the only one of its kind in the world [9] The palace has 60 rooms and 22 halls. It has considerable collections of the Nizam's artifacts including paintings, statues, furniture, manuscripts, books, an extensive jade collection, and the largest collection of Venetian chandeliers, with 40 138-arm Osler chandeliers in the halls. [10]
The dining hall can seat 101 guests. [3] The chairs are made of carved rosewood with green leather upholstery.
It has a library with a carved walnut roof, a replica of the one at Windsor Castle . The library houses more than five thousand books. It has an extensive collection of English, Urdu and Persian books as well as copies of the Quran , and rare first editions . [4]
The dining hall
Burroughs and Watts from England designed two identical billiards tables, one of which is in Buckingham Palace and the other in the palace's billiards room. [3]
The palace was the private property of the Nizam family, and not normally open to the public, until 2000.
Renovation into a luxury hotel
In 2000, Taj Hotels started renovating and restoring the palace. [11] The renovated hotel was opened in November 2010. [12] [13]
In popular culture
Scenes of films like Radhe Shyam and K.G.F: Chapter 2 were shot inside Falaknuma Palace. [14] [15]

This is a list of places of interest and historical significance in Kozhikode (Calicut).
Thali Subramanya Temple
[ edit ]
Kakkayam valley
Calicut beach is the most popular retreat for locals.[ citation needed ] This shore has been a witness to many historic events, including pitched naval battles and the arrival of ships from distant lands. Uddanda, a Sanskrit poet in Zamorin's court, wrote in his Kokila Sandeśa : ""The ocean, the father of the goddess of riches [Indira is a synonym of Lakshmi] seeing that his daughter has settled down in Kukkatakroda [Sanskrit for Kozhikode], is embracing the place, presenting it with shipful of jewels"". [1] Several national leaders like Mahatma Gandhi , Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan , Indira Gandhi and Krishna Menon have addressed people here. The 'Beach Road' was renamed Gandhi Road from Evan's Road after Mahatma Gandhi's visit in January 1934. Two dilapidated piers can be seen extending into the sea. The 'Iron Screw-pile' pier to the north was built in 1871, 400 ft long (120 m) with a 'T' end. Numerous cranes on these piers once loaded spices and other goods destined to foreign ports like Aden , Genoa , Oslo , London , Bremen , Hamburg , New York City etc.
Near the northern pier is a park maintained by the Lions club , a children's park, the lighthouse with a seafarer's memorial and a marine aquarium. Further north to the Lions' Park is a dirty fishing area where once was located a French loge with factories and French settlements. Near the south pier is a place called 'Horse's Jumping Point' where horses brought from Gujarat and Arabia were made to jump into the water, swim and would gallop along the shore and be displayed for sale. The beach offers a pleasant view at times of fishermen entering the sea with their tiny boats, fighting the waves and returning with their catch.

Veliyangadi (big bazaar)
[ edit ]
Veliyangadi is not a typical 'place of interest' to visit. The noise, rush and heat of this narrow lane would test any visitor's mettle. Nevertheless, not many streets can boast a 600-year-old history [2] and still be functioning as one of the main commercial centre of a city. In spite of creeping signs of modernity over hundreds of years, this crowded part of the city offers the best chance to visualize daily life at a commercial hub in medieval Calicut . Muslim, Jain and Hindu seths, Gujarathi and Marwari moneylenders and Tamil and Andhra Chettis can be seen busy with their businesses, as they did for centuries. Merchants and accountants still use a unique system of finger-code language as noted by Ma Huang of Zheng He 's fleet in 1403. The legend has it that the first secretary of the Zamorin, Mangat Achan, after a long penance had the goddess of wealth Lakshmi appear before him. He then made her promise to wait until he returned but went home and committed suicide. Unable to break her promise, it is said, Lakshmi stayed permanently in Veliyangadi.
Mananchira and nearby institutions
[ edit ]
A sculpture by Jacek Tylicki : ""Give If You Can - Take If You Have To""
Mananchira is a large tank in the heart of the city. Mananchira or Mana Vikraman Tank (Manan or Mana Vikraman being the Coronation name of the Zamorins) seems to have been the drinking water source for the entire Palace complex (previously located at the Kottaparambu Women and Children Hospital). Surrounding the Mananchira are several important institutions. The Town Hall was constructed in 1891 by the salt merchants (previously called Salt Abkari Town Hall) and has been an important stage for several popular agitations and ceremonies during the freedom movement and thereafter. The Pattalapalli or 'Military Mosque' was originally built for the Mysore soldiers who had surrounded the Palace during the 'Mysore invasion'. The Comtrust Textile Factory (previously the Commonwealth Weaving Factory) was established in 1884 by the Basel Mission from Germany. To the western side of Mananchira is located the C.S.I. Church, Basel Mission Complex and the BEM (Basel Evangelical Mission) Girls' School (1848). Once the main courtyard of the Zamorin Ruler's palace, the Mananchira ground along with the older Ansari Park (named after the freedom fighter Ansari) has been developed into a well- maintained park called 'Mananchira Square'. It has a green carpet lawn fenced with laterite- sculpted walls. The entire complex is circled by 250 lamp posts designed in 'colonial' style. The 'Square' has an artificial stream, a musical fountain, an open-air theatre and a music stage. There is a public library near mananchira square which has a collection of huge variety of books. Books from all disciplines are available here. Malabar Palace, one of the first star hotels in Malabar is also located here.
S.M. Street
[ edit ]
S.M. Street is a buzzing shopping and commercial lane immediately north of Mananchira Square. The name Sweetmeat is thought to have been derived from a kind of sweet (locally called 'halwa') which was called 'sweetmeat' by European traders. [3] S.M. Street, like the lanes of Veliyangadi, is about 600 years old and was most likely occupied by the residences and shops of sweet manufacturers from Gujarath. A now-abandoned Parsi cemetery called Anjuman, most likely built in the 17th century, is located here and finds mention in William Logan 's Malabar. [4]
Regional Science Centre and Planetarium
[ edit ]
View inside the Sarovaram Bio Park
Sarovaram is an eco-friendly bio-park in Kozhikode city. It is a project meant for conservation of the wetlands through eco-friendly tourism interventions by sustainable methods. This is one of the 27 wetlands of natural importance identified by the Government of India for conservation under National Wetland conservation program. The wetlands are rich with 7 mangrove spices, 29 mangrove associates and fauna ranging from protozoa to Otter. It is also a congenial habitat for 20 types of water birds, 2 bird associated with water, 3 birds associated with waterlogged reeds and 9 land birds. The 11 km long canal connects Korappuzha and Kallai rivers and brings in periodic influx of saline water which makes the habitat ideal for mangrove, fisheries and other biota. The major components of the project are canal walkway, boating facilities, Otter Park, Butterfly Park, bird sanctuary, aquarium, coracles, floating rafts, board-walk, park/ musical fountain, open-air theatre, Interpretation centre etc.
Tali Siva Temple
[ edit ]
Tali Siva temple, circa 1900
The Tali Siva temple was one of the two Brahmanical royal temples patronized by the Zamorin (the other being the Valayanaattu Kavu) and to this day remains one of the most important spiritual and cultural centres in Kozhikode. The temple's date of origin is uncertain but was most likely built during the foundation of the city itself in the 12th century or before. The temple is surrounded by gigantic walls of 'elephant belly' (aana palla) type with broad base and narrower neck at the top. One of the two tanks attached to the temple can be seen to the right. The temple hosts the annual 'competition for scholars' called Revathi Pattathanam attended by eminent scholars and philosophers of Bharatiya Mimamsa , Prabhakara Mimamsa, Vedanta Mimamsa and Vyakarana . The temple was also the site for the famous anti-caste agitation of 1911 organized by Krishna Vakil (editor of Mithavadi ) and advocate Manjeri Rama Ayyar for the rights of 'low-caste' people to use the road between the tank and the temple.
Mishkal Mosque
[ edit ]
Mishkal Mosque is one of the oldest mosques in Kerala. The Mosque was built by an Arab merchant, Nakhooda Mishkal, nearly 650 years ago. It is named Mishkal Mosque after him. It is located in Kuttichira, a part of Thekkepuram region in Kozhikode city. In 1510, the mosque was partially burned in a Portuguese attack. The top floors of the mosque still display some of that damage. Mishkal Mosque originally had five stories. It was reconstructed after the fire in 1510 and now has four stories. Typical for similarly aged mosques of the region, it has no cupolas and minarets and heavily employs timber. According to some historians, Kerala’s temple architecture influenced the architecture of old mosques in Kerala which have gopuram-style entrance arches and no minarets.
Panniyankara Bhagavati Temple
[ edit ]
The Bhagavaty temple on a hillock on the southern side of Kallayi river is one of the two pre- Calicut temples known to historians, built at least two centuries before the foundation of the city. This area must have come under the territory of Porlathiri during the reign of Ceraman Perumal. It is a typical Chera period structure with a square garbhagriha and mandapa and probably had a currambalam and prakara (outer walls) that are no more. Two granite slabs dating to the 10–11th century AD were recovered recently carrying three inscriptions in Vattezhuthu , an old Malayalam language. One is a record of a land grant of the Chera king Ravi Kota, who was crowned in 1021 AD. [5] Mentioned in the inscription are functionaries like Adhikarar (officials), Alkoyil (king's representative) and Poduval (temple secretary) and avirodham (a system of unanimous resolution), kalam (an old measure), etc. The second inscription dating back to 883–913 AD records a decision by the Taliyar and Tali Adhikarikal of 'Panriyankarai' to conduct seven Tiruvakkiram (sacred feast) at the shrine of Patari (female deity). The third inscription records a unanimous decision to transfer some land belonging to the daughter of the Chief Queen of Cheraman Perumal for the conduct of Tiru amritu (sacred feast).
Thiruvannur Siva Temple
[ edit ]
This Siva temple has an apsidal garbhagriha , decorated with typical Chola pillars and pilasters, panjaras and vyalimukhas. The central shrine has escaped any repair or change and is relatively well preserved. An inscription unearthed records a land grant given to Tirumannur Patarakar in the eighth regnal year of Raja Raja Chola. The record has been dated to 1044 AD. The deity appears to have been a Jain Tirthankara (since the rules of Thirukkunavaye, the premier Jain shrine of Kerala in Kodungalloor, are cited in the punitive clauses). The Jain temple must have been converted into a Siva temples sometime in the 11th century before the arrival of the Zamorins. [6] The apsidal shrine and other features are attributable to this period.

National Geographic (formerly The National Geographic Magazine, [3] sometimes branded as Nat Geo [4] ) is an American monthly magazine published by National Geographic Partners . [5] The magazine was founded in 1888 as a scholarly journal, nine months after the establishment of the society, but is now a popular magazine. In 1905, it began including pictures, a style for which it became well-known. Its first color photos appeared in the 1910s. During the Cold War , the magazine committed itself to present a balanced view of the physical and human geography of countries beyond the Iron Curtain . Later, the magazine became outspoken on environmental issues .
Until 2015, the magazine was completely owned and managed by the National Geographic Society . Since 2015, controlling interest has been held by National Geographic Partners.
Topics of features generally concern geography , history , nature , science , and world culture . The magazine is well known for its distinctive appearance: a thick square-bound glossy format with a yellow rectangular border. Map supplements from National Geographic Maps are included with subscriptions, and it is available in a traditional printed edition and an interactive online edition.
As of 1995 [update] , the magazine was circulated worldwide in nearly forty local-language editions and had a global circulation of at least 6.5 million per month including 3.5 million within the U.S., [6] [7] down from about 12 million in the late 1980s. As of 2015 [update] , the magazine had won 25 National Magazine Awards . [8]
In 2023, National Geographic laid off all staff writers and announced they would stop U.S. newsstand sales in the next year. [9] [10] [11]
As of November 2024 [update] , its Instagram page has 280 million followers, the third most of any account not belonging to an individual celebrity. [12] The magazine's combined U.S. and international circulation as of June 30, 2024 was about 1.65 million, with its kids magazines separately achieving a circulation of about 500,000. [13]
History
[ edit ]
Front cover from the first edition of The National Geographic Magazine, c. September 1888
The first issue of the National Geographic Magazine was published on September 22, 1888, eight months after the Society was founded. In the first issue, Gardiner Greene Hubbard writes,
The ""National Geographic Society"" has been organized to ""increase and defuse geographic knowledge"", and the publication of a Magazine has been determined upon as one means accomplishing these purposes. [14]
It was initially a scholarly journal sent to 165 charter members; in 2010, it reached the hands of 40 million people each month. [15] Starting with its January 1905 publication of several full-page pictures of Tibet in 1900–01, the magazine began to transition from being a text-oriented publication to featuring extensive pictorial content. By 1908 more than half of the magazine's pages were photographs. The June 1985 cover portrait of a 12-year-old Afghan girl Sharbat Gula , shot by photographer Steve McCurry , became one of the magazine's most recognizable images. [16]
National Geographic Kids , the children's version of the magazine, was launched in 1975 under the name National Geographic World.
At its peak in the late 1980s, the magazine had 12 million subscribers in the United States, and millions more outside of the U.S. [2]
In the late 1990s, the magazine began publishing The Complete National Geographic, an electronic collection of every past issue of the magazine. It was then sued over copyright of the magazine as a collective work in Greenberg v. National Geographic and other cases, and temporarily withdrew the compilation. The magazine eventually prevailed in the dispute, and in July 2009 resumed publishing all past issues through December 2008. More recent issues were later added to the collection; the archive and electronic edition of the magazine are available online to the magazine's subscribers. [17]
In September 2015, the National Geographic Society moved the magazine to a new owner, National Geographic Partners, giving 21st Century Fox a 73% controlling interest [18] in exchange for $725 million. In December 2017, a deal was announced for Disney to acquire 21st Century Fox , including the controlling interest in National Geographic Partners. [19] The acquisition was completed in March 2019. [20] NG Media publishing unit was operationally transferred into Disney Publishing Worldwide . [21]
In September 2022, the magazine laid off six of its top editors. [22] In June 2023, the magazine laid off all of its staff writers , shifting to an entirely freelance-based writing model, and announced that beginning in 2024 it would no longer offer newsstand purchases. [2]
Administration
[ edit ]
The magazine had a single ""editor"" from 1888 to 1920. From 1920 to 1967, the chief editorship was held by the president of the National Geographic Society . Since 1967, the magazine has been overseen by its own ""editor"" and/or ""editor-in-chief"". The list of editors-in-chief includes three generations of the Grosvenor family between 1903 and 1980. [23]
Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor (1875–1966): (Editor-in-Chief: February 1903– January 1920; Managing Editor: September 1900 – February 1903; Assistant Editor: May 1899 – September 1900)

Melville Bell Grosvenor (1901–1982): (January 1957 – August 1967) (president of the society at the same time) (thereafter editor-in-chief to 1977)
Frederick Vosburgh (1905–2005): (August 1967 – October 1970)
Gilbert Melville Grosvenor (born 1931): (October 1970 – July 1980) (then became president of the society)

Articles
[ edit ]
The first issue of The National Geographic Magazine featuring the oak leaf perimeter and yellow border. c. February 1910
During the Cold War , the magazine committed itself to present a balanced view of the physical and human geography of countries beyond the Iron Curtain .  The magazine printed articles on Berlin, de-occupied Austria , the Soviet Union , and Communist China that deliberately downplayed politics to focus on culture. In its coverage of the Space Race , National Geographic focused on the scientific achievement while largely avoiding reference to the race's connection to nuclear arms buildup. There were also many articles in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s about the individual states and their resources, along with supplementary maps of each state. Many of these articles were written by longtime staff such as Frederick Simpich . [27]
After 21st Century Fox acquired controlling interest in the magazine, articles became outspoken on topics such as environmental issues , deforestation , chemical pollution , global warming , and endangered species . Series of articles were included focusing on the history and varied uses of specific products such as a single metal, gem, food crop, or agricultural product, or an archaeological discovery. Occasionally an entire month's issue would be devoted to a single country, past civilization, a natural resource whose future is endangered, or other themes. In recent decades, the National Geographic Society has unveiled other magazines with different focuses. Whereas the magazine featured lengthy expositions in the past, recent issues have included shorter articles. [28]
Photography
[ edit ]

In addition to being well known for articles about scenery, history, and the most distant corners of the world, the magazine has been recognized for its book-like quality and the high standard of its photography. It was during the tenure of Society President Alexander Graham Bell and editor Gilbert H. Grosvenor (GHG) that the significance of illustration was first emphasized, in spite of criticism from some of the Board of Managers who considered the many illustrations an indicator of an ""unscientific"" conception of geography. By 1910, photographs had become the magazine's trademark and Grosvenor was constantly on the search for ""dynamical pictures"" as Graham Bell called them, particularly those that provided a sense of motion in a still image. In 1915, GHG began building the group of staff photographers and providing them with advanced tools including the latest darkroom. [29]
The magazine began to feature some pages of color photography in the early 1930s, when this technology was still in its early development. During the mid-1930s, Luis Marden (1913–2003), a writer and photographer for National Geographic, convinced the magazine to allow its photographers to use the so-called ""miniature"" 35 mm Leica cameras loaded with Kodachrome film over bulkier cameras with heavy glass plates that required the use of tripods . [29] In 1959, the magazine started publishing small photographs on its covers, later becoming larger photographs.  National Geographic photography quickly shifted to digital photography for both its printed magazine and its website. In subsequent years, the cover, while keeping its yellow border, shed its oak leaf trim and bare table of contents, to allow for a full-page photograph taken for one of the month's articles. Issues of National Geographic are often kept by subscribers for years and re-sold at thrift stores as collectibles. The standard for photography has remained high over the subsequent decades and the magazine is still illustrated with some of the highest-quality photojournalism in the world. [30] In 2006, National Geographic began an international photography competition, with over eighteen countries participating. [31]

Explanatory note
Hindu festival dates
The Hindu calendar is lunisolar but most festival dates are specified using the lunar portion of the calendar. A lunar day is uniquely identified by three calendar elements: māsa (lunar month), pakṣa (lunar fortnight) and tithi (lunar day).
Furthermore, when specifying the masa, one of two traditions are applicable, viz. amānta / pūrṇimānta . If a festival falls in the waning phase of the moon, these two traditions identify the same lunar day as falling in two different (but successive) masa.
A lunar year is shorter than a solar year by about eleven days. As a result, most Hindu festivals occur on different days in successive years on the Gregorian calendar.
romanized :
Rāmanavamī) is a Hindu festival that celebrates the birth of Rama , one of the most popularly revered deities in Hinduism, also known as the seventh avatar of Vishnu . [5] [6] [7] He is often held as an emblem within Hinduism for being an ideal king and human through his righteousness, good conduct and virtue. [7] [8] The festival falls on the ninth day of the bright half ( Shukla Paksha ) of the lunar cycle of Chaitra (March–April), the first month in the Hindu calendar . [9] It is also part of the Chaitra Navaratri festival in spring. [10] Rama Navami is a holiday for government employees in India. [11]
The rituals and customs associated with Rama Navami vary from region to region throughout India. The day is marked by reciting from the Hindu epic Ramayana which narrates the tale of Rama. [12] Vaishnava Hindus celebrate the festival by visiting temples, praying, fasting, listening to spiritual discourses and singing bhajans or kirtans (devotional songs). [5] [10] [13] Some devotees offer worship to Rama like an infant by placing an image of him in a cradle. [12] Charitable events and community meals are also organized. The festival is an occasion for moral reflection for many Hindus. [5] [14]
Important celebrations on this day take place at Ayodhya 's Ram Mandir and numerous Rama temples all over India. Ratha yatras (chariot processions) of Rama, Sita, Lakshmana , and Hanuman occur at several places. [5] [15] In Ayodhya, many take a dip in the sacred river Sarayu and then visit the Rama temple. [6]
Birth
[ edit ]
Details regarding the birth of Rama is mentioned in Valmiki's Ramayana and the Mahabharata. [8] As noted, Rama was born to King Dasharatha and Queen Kausalya in the city of Ayodhya . King Dasharatha had three wives - Kausalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra , but remained sonless for many years. Desperate for an heir, Dasharatha organized a sacrifice to be conducted under the authority of the sage, Rishyasringa , which concluded with a celestial figure that emerged from a fire with a pot of rice and milk. As instructed, the king divided the contents of the pot among his wives to drink. As a result, Kausalya gave birth to Rama on the ninth day of the bright half ( Shukla Paksha ) of the lunar cycle of Chaitra (March–April), also known as Rama Navami. Furthermore, Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharata and Sumitra bore twins - Lakshmana and Shatrughna . Thus, with the birth of four sons, Dasharatha's desire was fulfilled. [16]
Celebrations and  rituals
[ edit ]
Murti of an infant Rama in a cradle at Chinawal village temple, Maharashtra
A number of cities mentioned in the Ramayana legends about Rama's life observe major celebrations. [10] These include Ayodhya (Uttar Pradesh), [10] Rameswaram ( Tamil Nadu ), Bhadrachalam ( Telangana ) and Sitamarhi (Bihar).
The rituals and customs associated with Rama Navami vary from region to region throughout India. Many of these traditions include reading and listening to discourses from the Ramayana, [17] organizing ratha yatras (chariot processions), charitable events, hosting a wedding procession (kalyanotsavam) of Rama and Sita, [6] and offering reverence to Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman who have played important roles in Rama's life story. [18] Surya , the Hindu solar deity, is also worshipped among some communities. [17]
In Karnataka , Rama Navami is celebrated by the local mandalis (organizations) and streets, by dispersing free panakam (a jaggery drink) and some food. Additionally, in Bengaluru, Karnataka, the Sree Ramaseva Mandali , R.C.T (R.) Chamrajpet, organizes India's most prestigious, month-long classical music festival. The uniqueness of this 80 year old musical extravaganza is that celebrated Indian classical musicians, irrespective of their religion, from both genres – Carnatic (South Indian) and Hindustani (North Indian) – descend down to offer their musical rendition to Rama and the assembled audience. [19]
In eastern Indian states such as Odisha , Jharkhand , and West Bengal , the Jagannath temples and regional Vaishnava community observe Rama Navami, and begin preparations for their annual Jagannath Ratha Yatra in summer. [20]
Devotees associated with ISKCON fast throughout the day. [17] A number of ISKCON temples introduced a more prominent celebration of the occasion of the holiday with the view of addressing needs of growing native Hindu congregation. It was however a notable calendar event on the traditional Gaurabda calendar with a specific additional requirement of fasting by devotees. [21]
On April 17, 2024, the first Rama Navami after the consecration of Ayodhya's Ram Temple was celebrated by thousands of devotees across India. [22] On this occasion, the Ram Temple witnessed a unique event at noon as the forehead of the Ram Lalla murti was anointed with a ray of sunlight, known as Surya Tilak. [23] Scores of devotees watched the live-streaming of the event across the globe. [22]
Literature
[ edit ]
During Rama Navami, reading or listening from literature about Rama is a common practice. Reading the entire Ramayana (Hindu epic entailing the adventures of Rama) [24] for a week leading up to Rama Navami is organized. [5] [12] The earliest version of the text was composed by the sage Valmiki . [10]
Bhadrachalam temple in Telangana is one of the major Rama Navami celebration sites. [6]
Tulsidas 's Ramcharitmanas , a later version of the Ramayana written in the vernacular of that time, is also popularly recited. [25] The start of the composition of the Ramcharitmanas began on Rama Navami. [26]
Drama
[ edit ]
A public dramatic performance, known as Ramlila , is annually hosted on the festivals of Rama Navami and Vijayadashami. [27] [28] Ramlila encapsulates the story of Rama through music, drama, dance and various other mediums. [29] The enactments of Ramlila are inspired by the Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas. [10]
Outside of India
[ edit ]
Rama Navami is one of the Hindu festivals that is celebrated by the Indian diaspora with roots in Uttar Pradesh and other states. [30] The descendants of Indian indentured servants who were forced to leave India due to famines and then promised jobs in colonial South Africa before 1910 in British-owned plantations and mines, and thereafter lived under the South African apartheid regime, continued to celebrate Rama Navami by reciting the Ramayana and by singing bhajans of Tyagaraja and Bhadrachala Ramdas . The tradition continues in contemporary times in the Hindu temples of Durban every year. [31]
Similarly, in Trinidad and Tobago , Guyana , Suriname , Jamaica , other Caribbean countries, Mauritius , Malaysia , Singapore , and many other countries with Hindu descendants of colonial-era indentured workers forced to leave British India have continued to observe Rama Navami along with their other traditional festivals. [32]
It is also celebrated by Hindus in Fiji and Fijian Hindus who have re-migrated elsewhere. [33]

Mecca - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca,"e
Mecca ( /ˈmɛkə/ ; officially Makkah al-Mukarramah, [a] commonly shortened to Makkah [b] ) is the capital of Mecca Province in the Hejaz region of western Saudi Arabia ; it is the holiest city according to Islam . [4] It is 70 km (43 mi) inland from Jeddah on the Red Sea , in a narrow valley 277 m (909 ft) above sea level. Its metropolitan population in 2022 was 2.4 million, making it the third-most populated city in Saudi Arabia after Riyadh and Jeddah. Around 44.5% of the population are Saudi citizens and around 55.5% are Muslim foreigners from other countries. [5] Pilgrims more than triple the population number every year during the Ḥajj pilgrimage , observed in the twelfth Hijri month of Dhūl-Ḥijjah . [6] With over 10.8 million international visitors in 2023, Mecca was one of the ten most visited cities in the world. [7]
Mecca is generally considered ""the fountainhead and cradle of Islam "". [8] [9] Mecca is revered in Islam as the birthplace of the Islamic prophet Muhammad . The Hira cave atop the Jabal al-Nur (""Mountain of Light""), just outside the city, is where Muslims believe the Quran was first revealed to Muhammad. [10] Visiting Mecca for the Ḥajj is an obligation upon all able Muslims. The Great Mosque of Mecca , known as the Masjid al-Haram, is home to the Ka'bah , believed by Muslims to have been built by Abraham and Ishmael . It is Islam's holiest site and the direction of prayer ( qibla ) for all Muslims worldwide. [11]
Muslim rulers from in and around the region long tried to take the city and keep it in their control, and thus, much like most of the Hejaz region, the city has seen several regime changes . The city was most recently conquered in the Saudi conquest of Hejaz by Ibn Saud and his allies in 1925. Since then, Mecca has seen a tremendous expansion in size and infrastructure, with newer, modern buildings such as the Abraj Al Bait , the world's fourth-tallest building and third-largest by floor area , [12] towering over the Great Mosque. The Saudi government has also carried out the destruction of several historical structures and archaeological sites , [13] such as the Ajyad Fortress . [14] [15] [16] However, many of the demolitions have officially been part of the continued expansion of the Masjid al-Haram at Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina and their auxiliary service facilities in order to accommodate the ever-increasing number of Muslims performing the pilgrimage ( hajj ). [17] Non-Muslims are prohibited from entering the city . [18] [19]
Under the Saudi government, Mecca is governed by the Mecca Regional Municipality, a municipal council of 14 locally elected members headed by the mayor (called Amin in Arabic) appointed by the Saudi government . In 2015, the mayor of the city was Osama bin Fadhel Al-Barr; [20] [21] as of January 2022 [update] , the mayor is Saleh Al-Turki. [22] The City of Mecca amanah , which constitutes Mecca and the surrounding region, is the capital of the Mecca Province, which includes the neighbouring cities of Jeddah and Ta'if , even though Jeddah is considerably larger in population than Mecca. Prince Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud has been the provincial governor of the province since 16 May 2007. [23]
Etymology
Mecca has been referred to by many names. As with many Arabic words, its etymology is obscure. [24] Widely believed to be a synonym for Makkah, it is said to be more specifically the early name for the valley located therein, while Muslim scholars generally use it to refer to the sacred area of the city that immediately surrounds and includes the Ka'bah . [25] [26]
Bakkah
Main article: Bakkah
The Quran refers to the city as Bakkah in Surah Al Imran (3), verse 96: ""Indeed the first House [of worship] , established for mankind was that at Bakkah"". This is said to have been the name of the city at the time of Ibrahim and it is also transliterated as Baca, Baka, Bakah, Bakka, Becca and Bekka, among others. [27] [28] [29] It was a name for the city in the ancient world. [30]
Makkah, Makkah al-Mukarramah and Mecca
Makkah is the official transliteration used by the Saudi government and is closer to the Arabic pronunciation. [31] [32] The government adopted Makkah as the official spelling in the 1980s, but it is not universally known or used worldwide. [31] The full official name is Makkah al-Mukarramah ( Arabic : مكة المكرمة,
lit.
'Makkah the Honored'). [31] Makkah is used to refer to the city in the Quran in Surah Al-Fath (48), verse 24. [24] [33]
The word Mecca in English has come to be used to refer to any place that draws large numbers of people, and because of this some English-speaking Muslims have come to regard the use of this spelling for the city as offensive. [31] Nonetheless, Mecca is the familiar form of the English transliteration for the Arabic name of the city.
Macoraba, another ancient city name Claudius Ptolemy says was within Arabia Felix , was also claimed to be Mecca. [34] Some studies have questioned this association. [35] Many etymologies have been proposed: the traditional one is that it is derived from the Old South Arabian root M-K-R-B which means ""temple"". [35]
Other names
Another name used for Mecca in the Quran is at 6:92 where it is called Umm al-Qurā [36] (
أُمّ ٱلْقُرَى‎, meaning ""Mother of all Settlements""). [33] The city has been called several other names in both the Quran and ahadith . Another name used historically for Mecca is Tihāmah . [37] According to an Islamic suggestion, another name for Mecca, Fārān, is synonymous with the Desert of Paran mentioned in the Old Testament at Genesis 21 :21. [38] Arab and Islamic tradition holds that the wilderness of Paran, broadly speaking, is the Tihamah coastal plain and the site where Ishmael settled was Mecca. [38] Yaqut al-Hamawi , the 12th-century Syrian geographer, wrote that Fārān was ""an arabized Hebrew word, one of the names of Mecca mentioned in the Torah."" [39]
History
Prehistory
In 2010, Mecca and the surrounding area became an important site for paleontology with respect to primate evolution, with the discovery of a Saadanius fossil. Saadanius is considered to be a primate closely related to the common ancestor of the Old World monkeys and apes . The fossil habitat, near what is now the Red Sea in western Saudi Arabia, was a damp forest area between 28 million and 29 million years ago. [40] Paleontologists involved in the research hope to find further fossils in the area. [41]
Early history (up to 6th century CE)
The early history of Mecca is still largely shrouded by a lack of clear sources. The city lies in the hinterland of the middle part of western Arabia of which there are sparse textual or archaeological sources available. [42] This lack of knowledge is in contrast to both the northern and southern areas of western Arabia, specifically the Syro-Palestinian frontier and Yemen, where historians have various sources available such as physical remains of shrines, inscriptions, observations by Greco-Roman authors, and information collected by church historians. The area of Hejaz that surrounds Mecca was characterized by its remote, rocky, and inhospitable nature, supporting only meagre settled populations in scattered oases and occasional stretches of fertile land. The Red Sea coast offered no easily accessible ports and the oasis dwellers and bedouins in the region were illiterate. [42]
While one individual has suggested that Mecca’s population at the time of Muhammad was around 550, [43] research published by Binimad Al-Ateeqi in 2020 shows that the population was closer to 10,000 individuals, a figure extrapolated from data taken from historical records about the Battle of Badr and other military expeditions , emigrants to both Abyssinia and Madinah , and Muhammad’s own household. Al-Ateeqi, a researcher from Kuwait who has written extensively about the early history of Mecca, also makes deductions about the numbers of women, children, servants, and slaves living in Mecca at the time, pointing out that some wealthy individuals, such as Abdullah ibn Jud’an , had as many as 100 slaves. [44]
The first clear reference to Mecca in non-Islamic literature appears in 741 CE, long after the death of Muhammad, in the Byzantine-Arab Chronicle, though here the author places the region in Mesopotamia rather than the Hejaz. [45]
Possible earlier mentions are not unambiguous. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus writes about Arabia in the 1st century BCE in his work Bibliotheca historica , describing a holy shrine: ""And a temple has been set up there, which is very holy and exceedingly revered by all Arabians"". [46] Claims have been made this could be a reference to the Ka'bah in Mecca. However, the geographic location Diodorus describes is located in northwest Arabia, around the area of Leuke Kome , within the former Nabataean Kingdom and the Roman province of Arabia Petraea . [47] [48]
Ptolemy lists the names of 50 cities in Arabia, one going by the name of Macoraba. There has been speculation since 1646 that this could be a reference to Mecca. Historically, there has been a general consensus in scholarship that Macoraba mentioned by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE is indeed Mecca, but more recently, this has been questioned. [49] [50] Bowersock favors the identity of the former, with his theory being that ""Macoraba"" is the word ""Makkah"" followed by the aggrandizing Aramaic adjective rabb (great). The Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus also enumerated many cities of Western Arabia, most of which can be identified. According to Bowersock, he did mention Mecca as ""Geapolis"" or ""Hierapolis"", the latter one meaning ""holy city"" potentially referring to the sanctuary of the Kaaba . [51] Patricia Crone , from the Revisionist school of Islamic studies on the other hand, writes that ""the plain truth is that the name Macoraba has nothing to do with that of Mecca [...] if Ptolemy mentions Mecca at all, he calls it Moka, a town in Arabia Petraea "". [52]
Procopius ' 6th century statement that the Ma'add tribe possessed the coast of western Arabia between the Ghassanids and the Himyarites of the south supports the Arabic sources tradition that associates Quraysh as a branch of the Ma'add and Muhammad as a direct descendant of Ma'add ibn Adnan. [53] [54]
Historian Patricia Crone has cast doubt on the claim that Mecca was a major historical trading outpost. [55] [56] However, other scholars such as Glen W. Bowersock disagree and assert that Mecca was a major trading outpost. [57] [58] Crone later on disregarded some of her theories. [59] She argues that Meccan trade relied on skins, hides, manufactured leather goods, clarified butter, Hijazi woollens, and camels. She suggests that most of these goods were destined for the Roman army, which is known to have required colossal quantities of leather and hides for its equipment.
Mecca is mentioned in the following early Quranic manuscripts:
Codex Is. 1615 I, folio 47v, radiocarbon dated to 591–643 CE.
Codex Ṣanʿāʾ DAM 01–29.1, folio 29a, radiocarbon dated between 633 and 665 CE.
Codex Arabe 331, folio 40 v, radiocarbon dated between 652 and 765 CE.
The earliest Muslim inscriptions are from the Mecca- Ta'if area. [60]
Islamic narrative
Mecca mentioned in Quranic manuscript Codex Arabe 331 ( Q48:24 )
A 1787 Ottoman Turkish map of Al-Haram Mosque , and related religious sites, such as Jabal al-Nour
In the Islamic view, the beginnings of Mecca are attributed to the Biblical figures , Adam , Abraham , Hagar and Ishmael . It was Adam himself who built the first God's house in Mecca according to a heavenly prototype but this building was destroyed in the Noahic Flood . [42] The civilization of Mecca is believed to have started after Ibrāhīm (Abraham) left his son Ismāʿīl (Ishmael) and wife Hājar (Hagar) in the valley at Allah 's command.[ citation needed ] Some people from the Yemeni tribe of Jurhum settled with them, and Isma'il reportedly married two women, one after divorcing the first, on Ibrahim's advice. At least one man of the Jurhum helped Ismāʿīl and his father to construct or according to Islamic narratives, reconstruct, the Ka'bah ('Cube'), [61] [25] [62] which would have social, religious, political and historical implications for the site and region. [63] [64]
Muslims see the mention of a pilgrimage at the Valley of the Bakha in the Old Testament chapter Psalm 84 :3–6 as a reference to Mecca, similar to the Quran at Surah 3:96 In the Sharḥ al-Asāṭīr, a commentary on the Samaritan midrashic chronology of the Patriarchs, of unknown date but probably composed in the 10th century CE, it is claimed that Mecca was built by the sons of Nebaioth , the eldest son of Ismāʿīl or Ishmael . [65] [66] [67]
Thamudic inscriptions
Some Thamudic inscriptions which were discovered in the south Jordan contained names of some individuals such as ʿAbd Mekkat (
عَبْد مَكَّة‎, ""Servant of Mecca""). [68]
There were also some other inscriptions which contained personal names such as Makki (مَكِّي, ""Makkan, of Makkah""), but Jawwad Ali from the University of Baghdad suggested that there's also a probability of a tribe named ""Makkah"". [69]
Under the Quraish
Sometime in the 5th century, the Ka'bah was a place of worship for the deities of Arabia's pagan tribes . Mecca's most important pagan deity was Hubal , which had been placed there by the ruling Quraish tribe. [70] [71] and remained until the Conquest of Mecca by Muhammad .[ citation needed ] In the 5th century, the Quraish took control of Mecca, and became skilled merchants and traders. In the 6th century, they joined the lucrative spice trade , since battles elsewhere were diverting trade routes from dangerous sea routes to more secure overland routes. The Byzantine Empire had previously controlled the Red Sea , but piracy had been increasing.[ citation needed ] Another previous route that ran through the Persian Gulf via the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was also being threatened by exploitations from the Sassanid Empire , and was being disrupted by the Lakhmids , the Ghassanids , and the Roman–Persian Wars . Mecca's prominence as a trading center also surpassed the cities of Petra and Palmyra . [72] [73] The Sassanids however did not always pose a threat to Mecca, as in 575 CE they protected it from a Yemeni invasion, led by its Christian leader Abraha . The tribes of southern Arabia asked the Persian king Khosrau I for aid, in response to which he came south to Arabia with foot-soldiers and a fleet of ships near Mecca. [74]
By the middle of the 6th century, there were three major settlements in northern Arabia , all along the south-western coast that borders the Red Sea, in a habitable region between the sea and the Hejaz mountains to the east. Although the area around Mecca was completely barren, it was the wealthiest of the three settlements with abundant water from the renowned Zamzam Well and a position at the crossroads of major caravan routes. [75]
The harsh conditions and terrain of the Arabian peninsula meant a near-constant state of conflict between the local tribes , but once a year they would declare a truce and converge upon Mecca in an annual pilgrimage. Up to the 7th century, this journey was intended for religious reasons by the pagan Arabs to pay homage to their shrine, and to drink Zamzam . However, it was also the time each year that disputes would be arbitrated, debts would be resolved, and trading would occur at Meccan fairs. These annual events gave the tribes a sense of common identity and made Mecca an important focus for the peninsula. [76]
The Year of the Elephant (570 CE)
The "" Year of the Elephant "" is the name in Islamic history for the year approximately equating to 570–572 CE , when, according to Islamic sources such as Ibn Ishaq , Abraha descended upon Mecca, riding an elephant, with a large army after building a cathedral at San'aa , named al-Qullays in honor of the Negus of Axum . It gained widespread fame, even gaining attention from the Byzantine Empire . [77] Abraha attempted to divert the pilgrimage of the Arabs from the Ka'bah to al-Qullays, effectively converting them to Christianity. According to Islamic tradition, this was the year of Muhammad 's birth. [77] Abraha allegedly sent a messenger named Muhammad ibn Khuza'i to Mecca and Tihamah with a message that al-Qullays was both much better than other houses of worship and purer, having not been defiled by the housing of idols. [77] When Muhammad ibn Khuza'i got as far as the land of Kinana , the people of the lowland, knowing what he had come for, sent a man of Hudhayl called ʿUrwa bin Hayyad al-Milasi, who shot him with an arrow, killing him. His brother Qays who was with him, fled to Abraha and told him the news, which increased his rage and fury and he swore to raid the Kinana tribe and destroy the Ka'bah. Ibn Ishaq further states that one of the men of the Quraysh tribe was angered by this, and going to Sana'a, entering the church at night and defiling it; widely assumed to have done so by defecating in it. [78] [79]
Abraha marched upon the Ka'bah with a large army, which included one or more war elephants , intending to demolish it. When news of the advance of his army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kinanah, Khuza'a and Hudhayl united in the defense of the Ka'bah and the city. A man from the Himyarite Kingdom was sent by Abraha to advise them that Abraha only wished to demolish the Ka'bah and if they resisted, they would be crushed. Abdul Muttalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the hills while he and some members of the Quraysh remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abraha sent a dispatch inviting Abdul-Muttalib to meet with Abraha and discuss matters. When Abdul-Muttalib left the meeting he was heard saying: ""The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure he will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House."" [80] [81]
Abraha eventually attacked Mecca. However, the lead elephant, known as Mahmud, [82] is said to have stopped at the boundary around Mecca and refused to enter. It has been theorized that an epidemic such as by smallpox could have caused such a failed invasion of Mecca. [83] The reference to the story in Quran is rather short. According to the 105th Surah of the Quran, Al-Fil , the next day, a dark cloud of small birds sent by Allah appeared. The birds carried small rocks in their beaks, and bombarded the Ethiopian forces, and smashed them to a state like that of eaten straw. [84]
Economy
Camel caravans, said to have first been used by Muhammad's great-grandfather, were a major part of Mecca's bustling economy. Alliances were struck between the merchants in Mecca and the local nomadic tribes, who would bring goods – leather, livestock, and metals mined in the local mountains – to Mecca to be loaded on the caravans and carried to cities in Shaam and Iraq . [85] Historical accounts also provide some indication that goods from other continents may also have flowed through Mecca. Goods from Africa and the Far East passed through en route to Syria including spices, leather, medicine, cloth, and slaves; in return Mecca received money, weapons, cereals and wine, which in turn were distributed throughout Arabia. [ citation needed ] The Meccans signed treaties with both the Byzantines and the Bedouins , and negotiated safe passages for caravans, giving them water and pasture rights. Mecca became the center of a loose confederation of client tribes, which included those of the Banu Tamim . Other regional powers such as the Abyssinians , Ghassanids, and Lakhmids were in decline leaving Meccan trade to be the primary binding force in Arabia in the late 6th century. [76]

A fortification (also called a fort, fortress, fastness, or stronghold) is a military construction designed for the defense of territories in warfare , and is used to establish rule in a region during peacetime . The term is derived from Latin fortis (""strong"") and facere (""to make""). [1]

From very early history to modern times, defensive walls have often been necessary for cities to survive in an ever-changing world of invasion and conquest . Some settlements in the Indus Valley Civilization were the first small cities to be fortified. In ancient Greece , large cyclopean stone walls fitted without mortar had been built in Mycenaean Greece , such as the ancient site of Mycenae . A Greek phrourion was a fortified collection of buildings used as a military garrison , and is the equivalent of the Roman castellum or fortress. These constructions mainly served the purpose of a watch tower, to guard certain roads, passes, and borders. Though smaller than a real fortress, they acted as a border guard rather than a real strongpoint to watch and maintain the border.
The art of setting out a military camp or constructing a fortification traditionally has been called ""castrametation"" since the time of the Roman legions . Fortification is usually divided into two branches: permanent fortification and field fortification. There is also an intermediate branch known as semipermanent fortification. [2] Castles are fortifications which are regarded as being distinct from the generic fort or fortress in that they are a residence of a monarch or noble and command a specific defensive territory.
Roman forts and hill forts were the main antecedents of castles in Europe, which emerged in the 9th century in the Carolingian Empire . The Early Middle Ages saw the creation of some towns built around castles.
Medieval-style fortifications were largely made obsolete by the arrival of cannons in the 14th century. Fortifications in the age of black powder evolved into much lower structures with greater use of ditches and earth ramparts that would absorb and disperse the energy of cannon fire. Walls exposed to direct cannon fire were very vulnerable, so the walls were sunk into ditches fronted by earth slopes to improve protection.
The arrival of explosive shells in the 19th century led to another stage in the evolution of fortification. Star forts did not fare well against the effects of high explosives, and the intricate arrangements of bastions, flanking batteries and the carefully constructed lines of fire for the defending cannon could be rapidly disrupted by explosive shells. Steel -and- concrete fortifications were common during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The advances in modern warfare since World War I have made large-scale fortifications obsolete in most situations.

)
Many United States Army installations are known as forts, although they are not always fortified. During the pioneering era of North America, many outposts on the frontiers, even non-military outposts, were referred to generically as forts. Larger military installations may be called fortresses; smaller ones were once known as fortalices. The word fortification can refer to the practice of improving an area's defense with defensive works. City walls are fortifications but are not necessarily called fortresses.
The art of setting out a military camp or constructing a fortification traditionally has been called castrametation since the time of the Roman legions . Laying siege to a fortification and of destroying it is commonly called siegecraft or siege warfare and is formally known as poliorcetics . In some texts, this latter term also applies to the art of building a fortification.
Fortification is usually divided into two branches: permanent fortification and field fortification. Permanent fortifications are erected at leisure, with all the resources that a state can supply of constructive and mechanical skill, and are built of enduring materials. Field fortifications—for example breastworks —and often known as fieldworks or earthworks, are extemporized by troops in the field, perhaps assisted by workers and tools and with materials that do not require much preparation, such as soil, brushwood, and light timber , [2] or sandbags (see sangar ). An example of field fortification [3] was the construction of Fort Necessity by George Washington in 1754.
There is also an intermediate branch known as semipermanent fortification. [4] This is employed when in the course of a campaign it becomes desirable to protect some locality with the best imitation of permanent defenses that can be made in a short time, given ample resources and skilled civilian workers. [2] An example of this is the construction of Roman forts in England and in other Roman territories where camps were set up with the intention of staying for some time, but not permanently.
Castles are fortifications which are regarded as being distinct from the generic fort or fortress in that it describes a residence of a monarch or noble and commands a specific defensive territory. An example of this is the massive medieval castle of Carcassonne .

From very early history to modern times, walls have been a necessity for many cities. Amnya Fort in western Siberia has been described by archeologists as one of the oldest known fortified settlements, as well as the northernmost Stone Age fort. [6] In Bulgaria, near the town of Provadia a walled fortified settlement today called Solnitsata starting from 4700 BC had a diameter of about 300 feet (91 m), was home to 350 people living in two-story houses, and was encircled by a fortified wall. The huge walls around the settlement, which were built very tall and with stone blocks which are 6 feet (1.8 m) high and 4.5 feet (1.4 m) thick, make it one of the earliest walled settlements in Europe [7] [8] but it is younger than the walled town of Sesklo in Greece from 6800 BC. [9] [10]
Uruk in ancient Sumer ( Mesopotamia ) is one of the world's oldest known walled cities . The Ancient Egyptians also built fortresses on the frontiers of the Nile Valley to protect against invaders from adjacent territories, as well as circle-shaped mud brick walls around their cities. Many of the fortifications of the ancient world were built with mud brick, often leaving them no more than mounds of dirt for today's archeologists. A massive prehistoric stone wall surrounded the ancient temple of Ness of Brodgar 3200 BC in Scotland . Named the ""Great Wall of Brodgar"" it was 4 m (13 ft) thick and 4 m (13 ft) tall. The wall had some symbolic or ritualistic function. [11] [12] The Assyrians deployed large labor forces to build new palaces , temples and defensive walls. [13]

Remains of a fortified village, Borġ in-Nadur , Malta. Borġ in-Nadur is a notable example of Bronze Age fortifications.
In Bronze Age Malta , some settlements also began to be fortified. The most notable surviving example is Borġ in-Nadur , where a bastion built in around 1500 BC was found. Exceptions were few—notably, ancient Sparta and ancient Rome did not have walls for a long time, choosing to rely on their militaries for defense instead. Initially, these fortifications were simple constructions of wood and earth, which were later replaced by mixed constructions of stones piled on top of each other without mortar . In ancient Greece , large stone walls had been built in Mycenaean Greece , such as the ancient site of Mycenae (famous for the huge stone blocks of its ' cyclopean ' walls). In classical era Greece , the city of Athens built two parallel stone walls, called the Long Walls , that reached their fortified seaport at Piraeus a few miles away.
In Central Europe , the Celts built large fortified settlements known as oppida , whose walls seem partially influenced by those built in the Mediterranean . The fortifications were continuously being expanded and improved. Around 600 BC, in Heuneburg , Germany, forts were constructed with a limestone foundation supported by a mudbrick wall approximately 4 meters tall, probably topped by a roofed walkway, thus reaching a total height of 6 meters. The wall was clad with lime plaster, regularly renewed. Towers protruded outwards from it. [14] [15]

The Oppidum of Manching (German: Oppidum von Manching) was a large Celtic proto-urban or city-like settlement at modern-day Manching (near Ingolstadt), Bavaria (Germany). The settlement was founded in the 3rd century BC and existed until c. 50–30 BC. It reached its largest extent during the late La Tène period (late 2nd century BC), when it had a size of 380 hectares. At that time, 5,000 to 10,000 people lived within its 7.2 km long walls. The oppidum of Bibracte is another example of a Gaulish fortified settlement.
Bronze and Iron Age Near East
See also: Casemate
An ancient casemate wall at Masada .
The term casemate wall is used in the archeology of Israel and the wider Near East , having the meaning of a double wall protecting a city [16] or fortress, [17] with transverse walls separating the space between the walls into chambers. [16] These could be used as such, for storage or residential purposes, or could be filled with soil and rocks during siege in order to raise the resistance of the outer wall against battering rams. [16] Originally thought to have been introduced to the region by the Hittites , this has been disproved by the discovery of examples predating their arrival, the earliest being at Ti'inik (Taanach) where such a wall has been dated to the 16th century BC . [18] Casemate walls became a common type of fortification in the Southern Levant between the Middle Bronze Age (MB) and Iron Age II, being more numerous during the Iron Age and peaking in Iron Age II (10th–6th century BC). [16] However, the construction of casemate walls had begun to be replaced by sturdier solid walls by the 9th century BC , probably due the development of more effective battering rams by the Neo-Assyrian Empire . [16] [19] Casemate walls could surround an entire settlement, but most only protected part of it. [20] The three different types included freestanding casemate walls, then integrated ones where the inner wall was part of the outer buildings of the settlement, and finally filled casemate walls, where the rooms between the walls were filled with soil right away, allowing for a quick, but nevertheless stable construction of particularly high walls. [21]

The Romans fortified their cities with massive, mortar-bound stone walls. The most famous of these are the largely extant Aurelian Walls of Rome and the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople , together with partial remains elsewhere. These are mostly city gates, like the Porta Nigra in Trier or Newport Arch in Lincoln .
Hadrian's Wall was built by the Roman Empire across the width of what is now northern England following a visit by Roman Emperor Hadrian (AD 76–138) in AD 122.

Defensive wall of the ancient city of Dholavira , Gujarat 2600 BCE
A number of forts dating from the Later Stone Age to the British Raj are found in the mainland Indian subcontinent (modern day India , Pakistan , Bangladesh and Nepal ). ""Fort"" is the word used in India for all old fortifications. Numerous Indus Valley Civilization sites exhibit evidence of fortifications. By about 3500 BC, hundreds of small farming villages dotted the Indus floodplain. Many of these settlements had fortifications and planned streets. The stone and mud brick houses of Kot Diji were clustered behind massive stone flood dykes and defensive walls, for neighboring communities bickered constantly about the control of prime agricultural land. [22] The fortification varies by site. While Dholavira has stone-built fortification walls, Harrapa is fortified using baked bricks; sites such as Kalibangan exhibit mudbrick fortifications with bastions and Lothal has a quadrangular fortified layout. Evidence also suggested of fortifications in Mohenjo-daro . Even a small town—for instance, Kotada Bhadli, exhibiting sophisticated fortification-like bastions—shows that nearly all major and minor towns of the Indus Valley Civilization were fortified. [23] Forts also appeared in urban cities of the Gangetic valley during the second urbanization period between 600 and 200 BC, and as many as 15 fortification sites have been identified by archeologists throughout the Gangetic valley, such as Kaushambi , Mahasthangarh , Pataliputra , Mathura , Ahichchhatra , Rajgir , and Lauria Nandangarh . The earliest Mauryan period brick fortification occurs in one of the stupa mounds of Lauria Nandangarh, which is 1.6 km in perimeter and oval in plan and encloses a habitation area. [24] Mundigak ( c. 2500 BC) in present-day south-east Afghanistan has defensive walls and square bastions of sun dried bricks. [25]

India currently has over 180 forts, with the state of Maharashtra alone having over 70 forts, which are also known as durg, [26] [27] [28] many of them built by Shivaji , founder of the Maratha Empire .
A large majority of forts in India are in North India. The most notable forts are the Red Fort at Old Delhi , the Red Fort at Agra , the Chittor Fort and Mehrangarh Fort in Rajasthan , the Ranthambhor Fort , Amer Fort and Jaisalmer Fort also in Rajasthan and Gwalior Fort in Madhya Pradesh . [27]
Arthashastra , the Indian treatise on military strategy describes six major types of forts differentiated by their major modes of defenses.
Sri Lanka
Rock fort of Sigiriya built by King Kashyapa I of Anuradhapura .
Forts in Sri Lanka date back thousands of years, with many being built by Sri Lankan kings. These include several walled cities. With the outset of colonial rule in the Indian Ocean , Sri Lanka was occupied by several major colonial empires that from time to time became the dominant power in the Indian Ocean. The colonists built several western-style forts, mostly in and around the coast of the island. The first to build colonial forts in Sri Lanka were the Portuguese ; these forts were captured and later expanded by the Dutch . The British occupied these Dutch forts during the Napoleonic wars . Most of the colonial forts were garrisoned up until the early 20th century. The coastal forts had coastal artillery manned by the Ceylon Garrison Artillery during the two world wars.
Most of these were abandoned by the military but retained civil administrative officers, while others retained military garrisons, which were more administrative than operational. Some were reoccupied by military units with the escalation of the Sri Lankan Civil War ; Jaffna fort , for example, came under siege several times.
China

The Great Wall of China near Jinshanling . The Great Wall was a series of fortifications built across the historical northern borders of China.
Large tempered earth (i.e. rammed earth ) walls were built in ancient China since the Shang dynasty ( c. 1600–1050 BC); the capital at ancient Ao had enormous walls built in this fashion (see siege for more info). Although stone walls were built in China during the Warring States (481–221 BC), mass conversion to stone architecture did not begin in earnest until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The Great Wall of China had been built since the Qin dynasty (221–207 BC), although its present form was mostly an engineering feat and remodeling of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD).
In addition to the Great Wall, a number of Chinese cities also employed the use of defensive walls to defend their cities. Notable Chinese city walls include the city walls of Hangzhou , Nanking , the Old City of Shanghai , Suzhou , Xi'an and the walled villages of Hong Kong . The famous walls of the Forbidden City in Beijing were established in the early 15th century by the Yongle Emperor . The Forbidden City made up the inner portion of the Beijing city fortifications .
Philippines
Main article: Spanish colonial fortifications in the Philippines
During the Spanish Era several forts and outposts were built throughout the archipelago. Most notable is Intramuros , the old walled city of Manila located along the southern bank of the Pasig River . [29] The historic city was home to centuries-old churches, schools, convents, government buildings and residences, the best collection of Spanish colonial architecture before much of it was destroyed by the bombs of World War II . Of all the buildings within the 67-acre city, only one building, the San Agustin Church, survived the war.

Main articles: Ivatan people and Architecture of the Philippines
The Ivatan people of the northern islands of Batanes built their so-called idjang on hills and elevated areas [30] to protect themselves during times of war. These fortifications were likened to European castles because of their purpose. Usually, the only entrance to the castles would be via a rope ladder that would only be lowered for the villagers and could be kept away when invaders arrived.
An American flag raised at the Fort Santiago , 1898. Fort Santiago was a citadel that was a part of the Intramuros , a walled city within Manila.
The Igorots built forts made of stone walls that averaged several meters in width and about two to three times the width in height around 2000 BC. [31]
The Muslim Filipinos of the south built strong fortresses called kota or moong to protect their communities. Usually, many of the occupants of these kotas are entire families rather than just warriors. Lords often had their own kotas to assert their right to rule, it served not only as a military installation but as a palace for the local Lord. It is said that at the height of the Maguindanao Sultanate 's power, they blanketed the areas around Western Mindanao with kotas and other fortifications to block the Spanish advance into the region. These kotas were usually made of stone and bamboo or other light materials and surrounded by trench networks. As a result, some of these kotas were burned easily or destroyed. With further Spanish campaigns in the region, the sultanate was subdued and a majority of kotas dismantled or destroyed. kotas were not only used by the Muslims as defense against Spaniards and other foreigners, renegades and rebels also built fortifications in defiance of other chiefs in the area.[ citation needed ] During the American occupation, rebels built strongholds and the datus, rajahs, or sultans often built and reinforced their kotas in a desperate bid to maintain rule over their subjects and their land. [32] Many of these forts were also destroyed by American expeditions, as a result, very very few kotas still stand to this day.
Notable kotas:
Kota Selurong : an outpost of the Bruneian Empire in Luzon, later became the City of Manila .
Kuta Wato/Kota Bato : Literally translates to ""stone fort"" the first known stone fortification in the country, its ruins exist as the ""Kutawato Cave Complex"" [33]
Kota Sug/Jolo : The capital and seat of the Sultanate of Sulu . When it was occupied by the Spaniards in the 1870s they converted the kota into the world's smallest walled city.
Pre-Islamic Arabia
Main article: List of expeditions of Muhammad
Map of defenses available during the Battle of the Trench , 627. Muslim defenders repelled the Confederates using Medina's natural fortifications and makeshift trenches.
During Muhammad 's era in Arabia, many tribes made use of fortifications. In the Battle of the Trench , the largely outnumbered defenders of Medina, mainly Muslims led by Islamic prophet Muhammad, dug a trench , which together with Medina's natural fortifications, rendered the confederate cavalry (consisting of horses and camels ) useless, locking the two sides in a stalemate. Hoping to make several attacks at once, the confederates persuaded the Medina-allied Banu Qurayza to attack the city from the south. However, Muhammad's diplomacy derailed the negotiations, and broke up the confederacy against him. The well-organized defenders, the sinking of confederate morale, and poor weather conditions caused the siege to end in a fiasco. [34]
During the Siege of Ta'if in January 630, [35] Muhammad ordered his followers to attack enemies who fled from the Battle of Hunayn and sought refuge in the fortress of Taif. [36]
Islamic world
[ edit ]
The entire city of Kerma in Nubia (present day Sudan) was encompassed by fortified walls surrounded by a ditch. Archeology has revealed various Bronze Age bastions and foundations constructed of stone together with either baked or unfired brick. [37]
The walls of Benin are described as the world's second longest man-made structure, as well as the most extensive earthwork in the world, by the Guinness Book of Records, 1974. [38] [39] The walls may have been constructed between the thirteenth and mid-fifteenth century CE [40] or, during the first millennium CE. [40] [41] Strong citadels were also built other in areas of Africa. Yorubaland for example had several sites surrounded by the full range of earthworks and ramparts seen elsewhere, and sited on ground. This improved defensive potential—such as hills and ridges. Yoruba fortifications were often protected with a double wall of trenches and ramparts, and in the Congo forests concealed ditches and paths, along with the main works, often bristled with rows of sharpened stakes. Inner defenses were laid out to blunt an enemy penetration with a maze of defensive walls allowing for entrapment and crossfire on opposing forces. [42]
A military tactic of the Ashanti was to create powerful log stockades at key points. This was employed in later wars against the British to block British advances. Some of these fortifications were over a hundred yards long, with heavy parallel tree trunks. They were impervious to destruction by artillery fire. Behind these stockades, numerous Ashanti soldiers were mobilized to check enemy movement. While formidable in construction, many of these strongpoints failed because Ashanti guns, gunpowder and bullets were poor, and provided little sustained killing power in defense. Time and time again British troops overcame or bypassed the stockades by mounting old-fashioned bayonet charges, after laying down some covering fire. [43]
Defensive works were of importance in the tropical African Kingdoms. In the Kingdom of Kongo field fortifications were characterized by trenches and low earthen embankments. Such strongpoints ironically, sometimes held up much better against European cannon than taller, more imposing structures. [44]
Medieval Europe

Medieval defensive walls and towers in Szprotawa , Poland, made of field stone and bog iron .
Roman forts and hill forts were the main antecedents of castles in Europe , which emerged in the 9th century in the Carolingian Empire . The Early Middle Ages saw the creation of some towns built around castles. These cities were only rarely protected by simple stone walls and more usually by a combination of both walls and ditches . From the 12th century, hundreds of settlements of all sizes were founded all across Europe, which very often obtained the right of fortification soon afterward.
John Smith 's 1624 map of Bermuda with the first stone fortifications built by England in the New World .
The founding of urban centers was an important means of territorial expansion and many cities, especially in eastern Europe , were founded precisely for this purpose during the period of Ostsiedlung . These cities are easy to recognize due to their regular layout and large market spaces. The fortifications of these settlements were continuously improved to reflect the current level of military development. During the Renaissance era , the Venetian Republic raised great walls around cities, and the finest examples, among others, are in Nicosia (Cyprus), Rocca di Manerba del Garda (Lombardy), and Palmanova (Italy), or Dubrovnik (Croatia), which proved to be futile against attacks but still stand to this day. Unlike the Venetians, the Ottomans used to build smaller fortifications but in greater numbers, and only rarely fortified entire settlements such as Počitelj , Vratnik , and Jajce in Bosnia .
Development after introduction of firearms
See also: Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – Western Stato da Mar
Medieval-style fortifications were largely made obsolete by the arrival of cannons on the 14th century battlefield . Fortifications in the age of black powder evolved into much lower structures with greater use of ditches and earth ramparts that would absorb and disperse the energy of cannon fire. Walls exposed to direct cannon fire were very vulnerable, so were sunk into ditches fronted by earth slopes.
This placed a heavy emphasis on the geometry of the fortification to allow defensive cannonry interlocking fields of fire to cover all approaches to the lower and thus more vulnerable walls.
Table of a typical bastion fort , 1728. The development of bastion forts resulted from the increased use of cannons and firearms in the 14th century.
The evolution of this new style of fortification can be seen in transitional forts such as Sarzanello [45] in North West Italy which was built between 1492 and 1502. Sarzanello consists of both crenellated walls with towers typical of the medieval period but also has a ravelin like angular gun platform screening one of the curtain walls which is protected from flanking fire from the towers of the main part of the fort. Another example is the fortifications of Rhodes which were frozen in 1522 so that Rhodes is the only European walled town that still shows the transition between the classical medieval fortification and the modern ones. [46] A manual about the construction of fortification was published by Giovanni Battista Zanchi in 1554.
Fortifications also extended in depth, with protected batteries for defensive cannonry, to allow them to engage attacking cannons to keep them at a distance and prevent them from bearing directly on the vulnerable walls.
Suomenlinna , a sea fortress from 18th century in Helsinki , Finland
The result was star shaped fortifications with tier upon tier of hornworks and bastions , of which Fort Bourtange is an excellent example. There are also extensive fortifications from this era in the Nordic states and in Britain , the fortifications of Berwick-upon-Tweed and the harbor archipelago of Suomenlinna at Helsinki being fine examples.
19th century
[ edit ]
During the 18th century, it was found that the continuous enceinte , or main defensive enclosure of a bastion fortress, could not be made large enough to accommodate the enormous field armies which were increasingly being employed in Europe; neither could the defenses be constructed far enough away from the fortress town to protect the inhabitants from bombardment by the besiegers, the range of whose guns was steadily increasing as better manufactured weapons were introduced. Therefore, since refortifying the Prussian fortress cities of Koblenz and Köln after 1815, the principle of the ring fortress or girdle fortress was used: forts, each several hundred meters out from the original enceinte, were carefully sited so as to make best use of the terrain and to be capable of mutual support with neighboring forts. [47] Gone were citadels surrounding towns: forts were to be moved some distance away from cities to keep the enemy at a distance so their artillery could not bombard said urbanized settlements. From now on a ring of forts were to be built at a spacing that would allow them to effectively cover the intervals between them.
The arrival of explosive shells in the 19th century led to yet another stage in the evolution of fortification. Star forts did not fare well against the effects of high explosives and the intricate arrangements of bastions, flanking batteries and the carefully constructed lines of fire for the defending cannon could be rapidly disrupted by explosive shells.
The ditch and counterscarp of Fort Delimara . Built in 1878, Delimara was built as a typical polygonal fort ditches and counterscarps made to be very deep, vertically sided, and cut directly into the rocks.
Worse, the large open ditches surrounding forts of this type were an integral part of the defensive scheme, as was the covered way at the edge of the counterscarp . The ditch was extremely vulnerable to bombardment with explosive shells.
In response, military engineers evolved the polygonal style of fortification. The ditch became deep and vertically sided, cut directly into the native rock or soil, laid out as a series of straight lines creating the central fortified area that gives this style of fortification its name.
Wide enough to be an impassable barrier for attacking troops but narrow enough to be a difficult target for enemy shellfire, the ditch was swept by fire from defensive blockhouses set in the ditch as well as firing positions cut into the outer face of the ditch itself.
The profile of the fort became very low indeed, surrounded outside the ditch covered by caponiers by a gently sloping open area so as to eliminate possible cover for enemy forces, while the fort itself provided a minimal target for enemy fire. The entrypoint became a sunken gatehouse in the inner face of the ditch, reached by a curving ramp that gave access to the gate via a rolling bridge that could be withdrawn into the gatehouse.
The tunnels of Fort de Mutzig , German fortifications built in 1893. By the 19th century, tunnels were used to connect blockhouses and firing points in the ditch to the fort.
Much of the fort moved underground. Deep passages and tunnel networks now connected the blockhouses and firing points in the ditch to the fort proper, with magazines and machine rooms deep under the surface. The guns, however, were often mounted in open emplacements and protected only by a parapet ; both in order to keep a lower profile and also because experience with guns in closed casemates had seen them put out of action by rubble as their own casemates were collapsed around them.
The new forts abandoned the principle of the bastion, which had also been made obsolete by advances in arms. The outline was a much-simplified polygon, surrounded by a ditch. These forts, built in masonry and shaped stone, were designed to shelter their garrison against bombardment. One organizing feature of the new system involved the construction of two defensive curtains: an outer line of forts, backed by an inner ring or line at critical points of terrain or junctions (see, for example, Séré de Rivières system in France).
Traditional fortification however continued to be applied by European armies engaged in warfare in colonies established in Africa against lightly armed attackers from amongst the indigenous population. A relatively small number of defenders in a fort impervious to primitive weaponry could hold out against high odds, the only constraint being the supply of ammunition.
20th and 21st centuries
[ edit ]
Gun emplacement in Fort Campbell , built in the 1930s. Due to the threat of aerial warfare , the buildings were placed at a distance from each other, making it difficult to find from the air.
Steel -and- concrete fortifications were common during the 19th and early 20th centuries. However, the advances in modern warfare since World War I have made large-scale fortifications obsolete in most situations. In the 1930s and 1940s, some fortifications were built with designs taking into consideration the new threat of aerial warfare , such as Fort Campbell in Malta. [48] Despite this, only underground bunkers are still able to provide some protection in modern wars. Many historical fortifications were demolished during the modern age, but a considerable number survive as popular tourist destinations and prominent local landmarks today.
The downfall of permanent fortifications had two causes:
The ever-escalating power, speed, and reach of artillery and airpower meant that almost any target that could be located could be destroyed if sufficient force were massed against it. As such, the more resources a defender devoted to reinforcing a fortification, the more combat power that fortification justified being devoted to destroying it, if the fortification's destruction was demanded by an attacker's strategy. From World War II , bunker busters were used against fortifications. By 1950, nuclear weapons were capable of destroying entire cities and producing dangerous radiation . This led to the creation of civilian nuclear air raid shelters .
The second weakness of permanent fortification was its very permanency. Because of this, it was often easier to go around a fortification and, with the rise of mobile warfare in the beginning of World War II, this became a viable offensive choice. When a defensive line was too extensive to be entirely bypassed, massive offensive might could be massed against one part of the line allowing a breakthrough, after which the rest of the line could be bypassed. Such was the fate of the many defensive lines built before and during World War II, such as the Siegfried Line , the Stalin Line , and the Atlantic Wall . This was not the case with the Maginot Line ; it was designed to force the Germans to invade other countries (Belgium or Switzerland) to go around it, and was successful in that sense. [49]
A GBU-24 2,000 lb (910 kg) bomb hits the ground. The development of bunker busters , bombs designed to penetrate hardened targets buried underground, led to a decline in the use of fortifications.
Instead field fortification rose to dominate defensive action. Unlike the trench warfare which dominated World War I, these defenses were more temporary in nature. This was an advantage because since it was less extensive it formed a less obvious target for enemy force to be directed against.
If sufficient power were massed against one point to penetrate it, the forces based there could be withdrawn and the line could be reestablished relatively quickly. Instead of a supposedly impenetrable defensive line, such fortifications emphasized defense in depth , so that as defenders were forced to pull back or were overrun, the lines of defenders behind them could take over the defense.
Because the mobile offensives practiced by both sides usually focused on avoiding the strongest points of a defensive line , these defenses were usually relatively thin and spread along the length of a line. The defense was usually not equally strong throughout, however.
The strength of the defensive line in an area varied according to how rapidly an attacking force could progress in the terrain that was being defended—both the terrain the defensive line was built on and the ground behind it that an attacker might hope to break out into. This was both for reasons of the strategic value of the ground, and its defensive value.
This was possible because while offensive tactics were focused on mobility, so were defensive tactics. The dug-in defenses consisted primarily of infantry and antitank guns . Defending tanks and tank destroyers would be concentrated in mobile brigades behind the defensive line. If a major offensive was launched against a point in the line, mobile reinforcements would be sent to reinforce that part of the line that was in danger of failing.
Thus the defensive line could be relatively thin because the bulk of the fighting power of the defenders was not concentrated in the line itself but rather in the mobile reserves. A notable exception to this rule was seen in the defensive lines at the Battle of Kursk during World War II, where German forces deliberately attacked the strongest part of the Soviet defenses, seeking to crush them utterly.
The terrain that was being defended was of primary importance because open terrain that tanks could move over quickly made possible rapid advances into the defenders' rear areas that were very dangerous to the defenders. Thus such terrain had to be defended at all costs.
Cheyenne Mountain Complex is an underground bunker used by North American Aerospace Defense Command . Cheyenne Mountain is an example of a mid-20th century fortification built deep in a mountain.
In addition, since in theory the defensive line only had to hold out long enough for mobile reserves to reinforce it, terrain that did not permit rapid advance could be held more weakly because the enemy's advance into it would be slower, giving the defenders more time to reinforce that point in the line. For example, the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest in Germany during the closing stages of World War II is an excellent example of how difficult terrain could be used to the defenders' advantage.
After World War II, intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching much of the way around the world were developed, so speed became an essential characteristic of the strongest militaries and defenses. Missile silos were developed, so missiles could be fired from the middle of a country and hit cities and targets in another country, and airplanes (and aircraft carriers ) became major defenses and offensive weapons (leading to an expansion of the use of airports and airstrips as fortifications). Mobile defenses could be had underwater, too, in the form of ballistic missile submarines capable of firing submarine launched ballistic missiles . Some bunkers in the mid to late 20th century came to be buried deep inside mountains and prominent rocks, such as Gibraltar and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex . On the ground itself, minefields have been used as hidden defenses in modern warfare, often remaining long after the wars that produced them have ended.
Demilitarized zones along borders are arguably another type of fortification, although a passive kind, providing a buffer between potentially hostile militaries.
Military airfields
[ edit ]
Military airfields offer a fixed ""target rich"" environment for even relatively small enemy forces, using hit-and-run tactics by ground forces, stand-off attacks (mortars and rockets), air attacks, or ballistic missiles. Key targets—aircraft, munitions, fuel, and vital technical personnel—can be protected by fortifications.
Aircraft can be protected by revetments , hesco barriers , hardened aircraft shelters and underground hangars which will protect from many types of attack. Larger aircraft types tend to be based outside the operational theater.
Munition storage follows safety rules which use fortifications (bunkers and bunds) to provide protection against accident and chain reactions (sympathetic detonations). Weapons for rearming aircraft can be stored in small fortified expense stores closer to the aircraft. At Biên Hòa, South Vietnam, on the morning of May 16, 1965, as aircraft were being refueled and armed, a chain reaction explosion destroyed 13 aircraft, killed 34 personnel, and injured over 100; this, along with damage and losses of aircraft to enemy attack (by both infiltration and stand-off attacks), led to the construction of revetments and shelters to protect aircraft throughout South Vietnam .
Aircrew and ground personnel will need protection during enemy attacks and fortifications range from culvert section ""duck and cover"" shelters to permanent air raid shelters. Soft locations with high personnel densities such as accommodation and messing facilities can have limited protection by placing prefabricated concrete walls or barriers around them, examples of barriers are Jersey Barriers , T Barriers or Splinter Protection Units (SPUs). Older fortification may prove useful such as the old 'Yugo' pyramid shelters built in the 1980s which were used by US personnel on 8 Jan 2020 when Iran fired 11 ballistic missiles at Ayn al-Asad Airbase in Iraq.
Fuel is volatile and has to comply with rules for storage which provide protection against accidents. Fuel in underground bulk fuel installations is well protected though valves and controls are vulnerable to enemy action. Above-ground tanks can be susceptible to attack.
Ground support equipment will need to be protected by fortifications to be usable after an enemy attack.
Permanent (concrete) guard fortifications are safer, stronger, last longer and are more cost-effective than sandbag fortifications. Prefabricated positions can be made from concrete culvert sections. The British Yarnold Bunker is made from sections of a concrete pipe.
Guard towers provide an increased field of view but a lower level of protection.
Dispersal and camouflage of assets can supplement fortifications against some forms of airfield attack.
Counterinsurgency
[ edit ]
Just as in colonial periods, comparatively obsolete fortifications are still used for low intensity conflicts. Such fortifications range in size from small patrol bases or forward operating bases up to huge airbases such as Camp Bastion / Leatherneck in Afghanistan . Much like in the 18th and 19th century, because the enemy is not a powerful military force with the heavy weaponry required to destroy fortifications, walls of gabion , sandbag or even simple mud can provide protection against small arms and antitank weapons—although such fortifications are still vulnerable to mortar and artillery fire.
Forts
[ edit ]
The Ozama Fortress in Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic is recognized by UNESCO for being the oldest military construction of European origin in the Americas. [50]
Forts in modern American usage often refer to space set aside by governments for a permanent military facility; these often do not have any actual fortifications, and can have specializations (military barracks, administration, medical facilities, or intelligence).
However, there are some modern fortifications that are referred to as forts. These are typically small semipermanent fortifications. In urban combat, they are built by upgrading existing structures such as houses or public buildings. In field warfare they are often log, sandbag or gabion type construction.
Such forts are typically only used in low-level conflicts, such as counterinsurgency conflicts or very low-level conventional conflicts, such as the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation , which saw the use of log forts for use by forward platoons and companies . The reason for this is that static above-ground forts cannot survive modern direct or indirect fire weapons larger than mortars, RPGs and small arms.
Prisons and others
[ edit ]
Fortifications designed to keep the inhabitants of a facility in rather than attacker out can also be found, in prisons , concentration camps , and other such facilities. Those are covered in other articles, as most prisons and concentration camps are not primarily military forts (although forts, camps, and garrison towns have been used as prisons and/or concentration camps; such as Theresienstadt , Guantanamo Bay detention camp and the Tower of London for example).

Temples of Andhra Pradesh,http://www.templenet.com/encandh1.html,"[Temple List]
The State of Andhra
        Pradesh abounds in archeological remains and religious
        monuments. The Satavahanas of the 1st century AD left
        behind them many works of art, the remains of which are
        seen at Amaravati near Guntur. The Ikshvakus succeeded
        the Satavahanas and the monuments left behind by them
        were discovered at excavations at Nagarjunakonda.Some of
        the best known Budhist monuments of Andhra Pradesh such
        as the Mahastupa and some Hindu temples were found in
        these excavations.
The oldest temples
        in the State, Tirupati Venkateswara Temple and the
        Kalahasteeswara Temple date back to the pre Christian
        times. The Chalukyas of Badami (Karnataka) of about the
        6th century built the Alampur Bhrama temples.These are
        excellent examples of Chalukyan art and sculpture. The
        Vengi Chalukyas ruled coastal Andhra Pradesh from the 7th
        to the 11th centuries.
The Badami
        Chalukyas of Deccan were succeeded by the Rashtrakutas
        and the later Chalukyas. The Kakatiyas who succeeded the
        later Chalukyas and ruled from Warangal (11th - 14th
        century AD) constructed several beautiful temples that
        show a profuse display of sculptural work.. The North
        Eastern region of Andhra Pradesh was under the rule of
        the Ganga Kings and the temples of this region show
        influences of the Orissa style of architecture.
The Vijayanagar
        Empire caused a number of monuments to be built and
        patronized in the State. Mention must be made of the Sree
        Sailam temple and the ornate Lepakshi temples. The flat
        stuccoed granite ceilings of the Vijayanagar Empire
        provided a suitable background for frescoes as seen at
        Lepakshi.
Thus, the temples
        that line the length and breadth of the State stand in
        silent acknowledgement of centuries of history and the
        patronage of various kingdoms such as the Cholas and
        Pallavas of Tamilnadu, the Chalukyas of Deccan , the
        Eastern Gangas and the Vijayanagar Kings. Some of these
        temples have been visited and sung by the Alwar
        (Vaishnavite) and the Nayanmar (Saivite) Saints of
        Tamilnadu.
The following list
        is a pointer to some of the temples in Andhra Pradesh.

Rail transport in India consists of primarily of passenger and freight shipments along an integrated rail network. Indian Railways (IR), a statutory body under the ownership of the Ministry of Railways of the Government of India , operates India's national railway system. It is the primary owner and operator of rail operations throughout the country including suburban rail in major metros.
Majority of the metro urban rail networks are operated by independent bodies constituted for the purpose of the respective operations. Private owned rails exist in few places, mostly used to connect freight to the integrated rail network. Inter-city rail services are operated primarily by Indian Railways though efforts have been made to introduce privately operated trains as recently as 2022.
The national rail network comprised total route length of 68,584 km (42,616 mi), with more than 132,310 km (82,210 mi) of track and 8,000+ stations and is the fourth-largest in the world . It is one of the busiest networks in the world, transporting more than 11 billion passengers and 1.416 billion tonnes of freight annually. As of August 2024, more than 64,080 km (39,820 mi) of all the routes have been electrified with 25 KV AC electric traction . The rolling stock consisted of 318,196 freight wagons , 84,863 passenger coaches , 14,781 locomotives and other multiple units owned by Indian Railways apart from rail-sets operated by metro rail corporations.
Studies by economic historians have identified substantially beneficial economic effects from the Indian railway network. [6] [7]
History
[ edit ]
In 1832, the proposal to construct the first railway line in India at Madras was made. [8] [9] In 1835, a railway track was constructed between Red Hills and Chintadripet in Madras and became operational in 1837. It was hauled by a rotary steam engine imported from England and was used for ferrying granite . [10]
The Madras Railway was established in 1845. [9] Temporary railway lines were built such as the Godavari Dam Construction Railway at Dowleswaram by Arthur Cotton to supply stone for the construction of a dam over the Godavari River in 1845 and the Solani aqueduct railway, built by Proby Cautley in Roorkee to transport construction materials for an aqueduct over the Solani river in 1851. [9] On 1 August 1849, the Great Indian Peninsular Railway was incorporated with a guarantee system providing free land and guaranteeing five-percent rates of return to private English companies building railways. [9] In 1852, a steam locomotive imported from England was tried at Byculla . [11]
1853–1924: Passenger railways and expansion

In 1853, the first passenger train on 1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in) broad gauge ran for 34 kilometres (21 mi) between Bombay and Thane which had 14-carriages carrying 400 people, hauled by three steam locomotives: the Sahib, Sindh and Sultan. [12] [13] The Great Southern of India Railway Company was established with its headquarters in England in 1853. [14] The Thane viaducts, the first railway bridges , were built over the Thane creek when the Mumbai-Thane line was extended to Kalyan in May 1854. Eastern India's first passenger train ran 39 km (24 mi) from Howrah , near Kolkata , to Hoogly on 15 August 1854. [9] The construction of 97 km (60 mi) line in the South between Royapuram in Madras and Arcot started in 1853, which became operational on 1 July 1856. [15] The first workshops were established by GIPR at Byculla in 1854 and Madras Railway at Perambur in 1856. The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway (BB&CI) was incorporated in 1855 and Eastern Bengal Railway in 1858. [16] [17] The Carnatic Railway was founded in 1869. [14] On 24 February 1873, a horse-drawn 3.8 km (2.4 mi) tram opened in Calcutta between Sealdah and Armenian Ghat street. [18] On 9 May 1874, a horse-drawn tramway began operation in Bombay between Colaba and Parel . [19] The Great Southern of India Railway and the Carnatic Railway merged in 1874 to form the South Indian Railway . [20] In 1879, the Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway was established which built railway lines across the then Hyderabad State . [21] In 1877, an Ajmer built F-1/734 Steam Locomotive became the first indigenously built locomotive in India. [22] East Coast State Railway was established in 1890. [23] In 1897, lighting in passenger coaches was introduced with Jodhpur Railway, the first to introduce electric lighting as standard fixtures. [9] In 1908, Madras Railway merged with Southern Mahratta Railway to form the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway . [24] Pamban bridge , the first sea bridge was opened on 24 February 1914. [25] In 1920, electric lighting of signals was introduced between Dadar and Currey Road in Bombay. [26]
1925–1949: Electrification and further expansion
[ edit ]
Railway map of India in 1909
The first railway budget was presented in 1924. [9] The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway was merged with the East Indian Railway Company (EIR) in the same year. [27] On 3 February 1925, the first electric train ran between Victoria Terminus (VT) and Kurla , hauled by a SLM electric locomotive on 1500 V DC traction. [28] Later, the VT– Bandra section was electrified and the first Electric Multiple Units (EMU) were introduced in with 1.5KV DC units imported were from Cammell Laird and Uerdingenwagonfabrik . [29] On 1 April 1929, Grand Trunk Express commenced operations between Peshawar in the North Western Railway and Mangalore with two coaches detached and connected to Madras further. [30] [31] The Frontier Mail made its inaugural run between Bombay and Peshawar in 1928. [32] Technical advancements led to automatic colour light signals that become operational between Bombay and Byculla in 1928. [33] In the subsequent years, the route from Bombay to Poona was electrified and in June 1930, the first deluxe train, Deccan Queen began running, hauled by a WCP-1 locomotives with seven coaches along the route. [34] The Grand Trunk express commenced operating as a dedicated daily train between Madras and Delhi from 1 September 1930. [35] Chennai suburban railway started operating in 1931 with a single metre gauge line from Chennai Beach to Tambaram . [36] In 1944, all the railway companies were taken over by the Government. [37]
Indian Railway Classification
Beginning 1926 and for statistical purposes, the Government of British Raj classified Indian railway systems according to three classes.  It was a similar system to the Railroad classes in North America. [38] [39]
Class I
Railways with gross annual earnings of over 5,000,000 INR
Class II
Railways with gross annual earnings of between 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 INR
Class III
Railways with gross annual earnings of under 1,000,000 INR
Trams , industrial and port railways were recorded separately and independently of turnover.
In terms of net revenue, East Indian Railway was the largest company in 1927 with 86,881,000 rupees. Followed by the North Western State Railway with 57,343,000 rupees and the Great Indian Peninsula Railway with 56,215,000 rupees. [40] No further reclassification was carried out after 1942, but the rankings remained in use until the mid-1950s. [38] [41]
1950–1983: Zonal re-organisation and further developments
[ edit ]
The first locomotive manufacturing unit at Chittaranjan was commissioned in 1950. [42] In December 1950, the Central Advisory Committee for Railways approved the plan for re-organising Indian Railways into six regional zones with the Southern (14 April 1951), Central (5 November 1951), and Western (5 November 1951) zones being the first to be created. [43] On 14 April 1952, the Northern Railway , the Eastern Railway and the North Eastern Railway were created. [43] In 1952, fans and lights were mandated for all compartments in passenger trains and sleeping accommodations were introduced in coaches. [9] In 1953, the Indian Railways completed hundred years of operation which was commemorated by multiple events and a commemorative postage stamp. [44] [45] The first diesel locomotive used in India was fabricated by North British Locomotive Company in 1954. [46] On 1 August 1955 the South-Eastern Railway was split from the Eastern Railway, and, the following year, divisional systems of administration were set up for the various regional zones. The first rail coaches were manufactured in India from 1956 when the Integral Coach Factory was established at Madras. [47] In 1956, the first air-conditioned train plied between Howrah and New Delhi . [48] In 1958, the North-Eastern Railway split to form a new Northeast Frontier Railway . [43]
WAP-1 electric locomotives reached a speed of 130 km/h (81 mph) in 1980
In 1957, Indian Railways adopted 25 kV AC traction with the first trial runs operating with the WAM-1 locomotives in 1959 and commercial services beginning in August 1960. [29] In 1960, the Railway Board of India commissioned a study to increase the speed of passenger trains to 160 km/h (99 mph) with an intermediate stage of 120 km/h (75 mph). [49] Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) started work on the same in 1962 with field trials commencing in 1967 with coaches manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory at Madras and hauled by diesel locomotives . [49] The first containerized freight rail transport began between Bombay and Ahmedabad in 1966. [9] In 1966, electrification of several suburban tracks around Delhi, Madras and Calcutta were completed with the 25 kV AC system. In 1969, the Government of India announced the introduction of a new express train capable of reaching speeds of up to 120 km/h (75 mph) in the railway budget and the first Rajdhani Express was flagged off from New Delhi to Howrah in March 1969. [50] [51] In 1974, Indian Railways endured a 20-day strike . [52] [53] In 1979, the Main Line Electrification Project was reconstituted into the Central Organisation for Railway Electrification (CORE). [54] In 1980, the WAP-1 electric locomotives reached a speed of 130 km/h (81 mph). [55]

Kashmir Valley in the spring
Jammu and Kashmir is home to several valleys such as the Kashmir Valley , Chenab Valley , Sindh Valley and Lidder Valley . Some major tourist attractions in Jammu and Kashmir are Srinagar, with its renowned Dal Lake and Mughal Gardens, Gulmarg , Pahalgam , Bhaderwah , Patnitop and Jammu. Every year, thousands of Hindu pilgrims visit holy shrines of Vaishno Devi and Amarnath which has had a significant impact on the state's economy. [1]
However, throughout the previous three decades, tourism in the region had drastically decreased prior to 2019, yet Compared to the 2.11 crore visitors in 2023, the region had an unprecedented 2.35 crore visitors in 2024, setting a new record. According to LG Sinha, foreign travel has also experienced a notable uptick, rising by more than 300 percent over the past two and a half years. [2]
Kashmir Valley is one of the top tourist destinations of India.
[3] Gulmarg, one of the most popular ski resort destinations in India, is also home to the world's highest green golf course . [4] [5]
Jammu and Kashmir also has flower gardens and apple orchards. It attracts tourists for its handicrafts and the Kashmiri shawls .
Major attractions in North Kashmir
[ edit ]
North Kashmir is a region in the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, renowned for its stunning landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and natural beauty. The first-ever map of tourism in Jammu and Kashmir was published in Konnect Magazine and later shared on the official Twitter handle of Jammu and Kashmir Tourism. The region is predominantly located in the Himalayan mountains, offering picturesque vistas of snow-capped peaks, lush valleys, and serene lakes. Key attractions include Gulmarg, a popular hill station known for its expansive meadows, the Gulmarg Gondola (one of the highest cable cars in the world), and winter sports such as skiing. Kupwara, often referred to as ""Kashmir's Switzerland,"" features scenic spots like Lolab Valley, Rishipathri Lake, and lush forests, making it an ideal destination for nature enthusiasts. The historic town of Baramulla offers ancient temples, the vast Wular Lake (one of Asia's largest freshwater lakes), and picturesque views along the Jhelum River. Pahalgam, while technically in South Kashmir, is frequently included in the region’s travel circuit, known for attractions like Betaab Valley, Aru Valley, and Baisaran Hills. North Kashmir's combination of natural beauty, adventure opportunities, and cultural significance makes it a popular destination for travelers.
Bangus Valley
[ edit ]
Between the green hills, streams, and meadows lie a valley in Jammu and Kashmir's Kupwara where the cattle run wild, birds sing lullabies through the day.[ citation needed ] The place is named Bangus Valley . According to a report,[ clarification needed ] the valley is located nearly 10,000 meters above sea level (MSL). The Bangus Valley is located in Kupwara district of North Kashmir. It is situated to the West of Handwara town along the Mawri River within the Handwara sub-district. district Kupwara. The term Bangus comes from Sanskrit word Van (Forest) and gus (grass).
The valley is nearly 130 km from Srinagar and is situated on the northwestern border of Tehsil Handwara in Kupwara. Divided into two parts-Bod Bungus (Big Bungus) and Lokut Bungus (Small Bungus) the valley spans over an area of 300 km2. Bangus is about 150 kilometres (93 miles) from Srinagar at an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,000 m). The principal valley is locally known as ""Boud Bangus"" (Big Bangus) and has an estimated area of about 300 square kilometers. It consists of a linear elliptical bowl aligned along the east–west axis and is surrounded by Rajwar and Mawar in the east, Shamasbury and Dajlungun Mountains in the west and Chowkibal and Karnah Guli in the north. It is surrounded by the Shamsbery mountain range and the Leepa Valley, according to the report.[ clarification needed ] After years of planning,[ citation needed ] Bangus was recently[ when? ] made motorable via the Mawer route while work is in full swing on the Chowkibal and Rajwar routes.
Its high altitude and unpredictable weather conditions were a huge obstacle but the administration has materialized this project in a short span of time. The Centre recognised 75 new destinations in the Union Territory for tourism this year.[ when? ] Under the Jal Jeevan Mission and 'Har Ghar Nal Say Jal Mission, the water scarcity days of Kupwara are over. The district constructed 400 Amrit Sarovar in 2022 to support the safe drinking water initiative of the government. The Kupwara District Administration and Tourism Department organized a two-day Bangus Mela earlier this year in August. The event focused on the traditions and culture of the region.[ citation needed ] Music artists, singers, Kashmiri Rowfdancers, and school report said.[ clarification needed ] children organized shows for the audience. Pony wallas also put up a special segment with the ponies displaying riding tricks and offering salami to the spectators. The festival folk songs were played nonstop which added to the upbeat atmosphere of the usually quiet valley.[ citation needed ]
The Lolab Bangus Drang yari Development Authority (LRDDA) installed night-stay tents for tourists. The meadows and slopes of Bungus are enveloped in flowers and medicinal plants such as Macrotima Benthami (gew zaban), Saussurea Sacra (Jugi pedshah), and Aconitum Heterophylleum (patrees). Recently[ when? ] a new species of flowering medicinal plant 'Swertia Kashmirensis' has been discovered in Bungus.[ citation needed ] The fauna in Bungus includes musk deer, antelope, snow leopards, brown and black bears, monkeys, and red foxes. The bird species include pheasants, tragopan, black partridge, bush quail, and wildfowl. Until two years ago,[ when? ] the valley was not an easy destination due to its proximity to the LoC (5 km) but the reinstallation of better security systems after the abrogation of Article 370, has helped to increase the faith of explorers who earlier did not find it safe to visit. Previously, visitors had to obtain permits from the District Magistrate to trek and camp but with the ripple effect of the political developments has been so effective that all such restrictions have now been lifted.[ citation needed ]
As of 2 June 2022, the road connectivity from Handwara side via Mawer is complete. People can take only small cars to Bangus because work on macdamisation is still going on. Vehicles are available on rent basis from Handwara market. Night stay tents are also available there. There are three routes to visit this place. The least distance route from Handwara via Reshwari Mawer. The second route is also from Handwara but via Rajwar and is suitable for trekking only. The third route from Kupwara via Chowkibal.
Bhadrakali Mandir
[ edit ]
An ancient idol of Mata Bhadrakali was reinstalled at a temple in Jammu and Kashmir's Kupwara district years after it was brought back from Jammu. The ancient temple at Bhadrakali Village in Handwara wore a festive look as the original idol of the presiding deity, Maa Bhadrakali, was restored to its original abode in a simple ceremony in March 2019. [6] The idol was stolen in 1981 was subsequently recovered and kept in Jammu since 1999. It is believed that during the exodus of Pandits from Handwara, the idol was left behind in the house of Pandit Jaggernath. The nearest airport is Sheikh ul-Alam International Airport in Srinagar located 78.8 kilometers from Handwara. Handwara is not yet connected to railways. The nearest railway station is Baramulla railway station located 30 kilometers from Handwara. Handwara is well-connected with roads and highways. The NH 701 passes through Handwara alongside other intra-town roads.
Tithwal
[ edit ]
Tithwal is a small border village about 171 km from Srinagar. After a scenic drive through Sopore, Kupwara and on to Tangdhar, one arrives at Tithwal. Another 80 km and on comes Sharda Peeth. Beyond the Sadhna top lies the Karnah valley along the river Kishan-Ganga and at the edge of it is the last village of North-West Kashmir, Tithwal. At 10600 feet, Sadhna pass [7] nested on the mighty Shamshabari mountain ranges originally known as Nastachun Pass is the only access to the Karnah, Neelam and Leepa valley. In the olden days, Tithwal was the trading hub where hundreds of shops lined up selling ghee, honey and walnut kernels. Those commodities would reach Tithwal from Karnah, Leepa and Neelam valleys. To immerse fully into the surroundings, the Forest Department of J&K, like at many other places, have built Kail and Deodar huts.[ citation needed ] To reach Tithwal one has to take NH1 from Airport road. After travelling for 45 km on NH1 take a right turn to Sangrama – Sopore road and then turn left onto Sopore – Kupwara road and then follow NH 701 to reach Tithwal.
Ancient Stupa Parihaspora
[ edit ]
Paraspore or Paraspur is a small town 22 km North-West of Srinagar in the Kashmir Valley. It was built on a plateau above the Jhelum River by Lalitaditya Muktapida . Parihaspur lost its status as a capital after Lalitaditya's death. His son moved the royal residence. The Jhelum River is to the northeast of Parihaspur as it meets the Sind Nallah at Shadpur sangam. In the past this confluence of the rivers occurred closer to Parihaspur. To reach Paraspore one has to head southwest on Airport Road, make a U-turn to hit NH1. Continue straight on NH1 past M.R.

Detha Mandir
[ edit ]
The lord Detha temple [8] is situated in a small village about 105 km from Srinagar.  To reach this temple, one must take a long drive moving from Srinagar to Pattan and onwards to Uri. The century-old map is the key to understanding the wealth of Hindu heritage and culture that Kashmir was once renowned for. One of the most noted monuments documented by many archaeologists, historians and architects is the Datta Mandir located at Banihal near Uri.[ citation needed ] To reach Detha Mandir one has to head Southwest on Airport Road, make a U-turn to hit NH1and drive for 3.8 km followed by a slight left onto NH1. After a drive of 15 km on NH1 past M.R. Brand, turn left after 1.2 km on to NH1. Stay on this road for 89 km until you reach Datta Temple, Uri.

Rashtrakutas
Early medieval Indian dynasty (mid-6th to 10th century)
Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta
Rashtrakuta control around 790 AD, during the Tripartite Struggle [1]
Capital
Indra IV
973–982
The Rashtrakutas [a] were a royal Indian dynasty ruling large parts of the Indian subcontinent between the 6th and 10th centuries. The earliest known Rashtrakuta inscription is a 7th-century copper plate grant detailing their rule from Manapur, a city in Central or West India. Other ruling Rashtrakuta clans from the same period mentioned in inscriptions were the kings of Achalapur and the rulers of Kannauj . Several controversies exist regarding the origin of these early Rashtrakutas, their native homeland and their language.
The Elichpur clan was a feudatory of the Badami Chalukyas , and during the rule of Dantidurga , it overthrew Chalukya Kirtivarman II and went on to build an empire with the Gulbarga region in modern Karnataka as its base. This clan came to be known as the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta , rising to power in South India in 753 AD. At the same time the Pala dynasty of Bengal and the Prathihara dynasty of Gurjaratra were gaining force in eastern and northwestern India respectively. An Arabic text, Silsilat al-Tawarikh (851), called the Rashtrakutas one of the four principal empires of the world. [3]
This period, between the 8th and the 10th centuries, saw a tripartite struggle for the resources of the rich Gangetic plains , each of these three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time. At their peak the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire stretching from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Kanyakumari in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions. The early kings of this dynasty were influenced by Hinduism and the later kings by Jainism .
During their rule, Jain mathematicians and scholars contributed important works in Kannada and Sanskrit . Amoghavarsha I , the most famous king of this dynasty wrote Kavirajamarga , a landmark literary work in the Kannada language. Architecture reached a milestone in the Dravidian style, the finest example of which is seen in the Kailasanatha Temple at Ellora in modern Maharashtra . Other important contributions are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal in modern Karnataka, both of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites .
History
Further information: Origin of the Rashtrakuta dynasty , Branches of Rashtrakuta dynasty , and Carnatic expansion
The origin of the Rashtrakuta dynasty has been a controversial topic of Indian history. These issues pertain to the origin of the earliest ancestors of the Rashtrakutas during the time of Emperor Ashoka in the 2nd century BCE , [4] and the connection between the several Rashtrakuta dynasties that ruled small kingdoms in northern and central India and the Deccan between the 6th and 7th centuries. The relationship of these medieval Rashtrakutas to the most famous later dynasty, the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta (present-day Malkhed in the Kalaburagi district , Karnataka state), who ruled between the 8th and 10th centuries has also been debated. [5] [6] [7]
The sources for Rashtrakuta history include medieval inscriptions , ancient literature in the Pali language, [8] contemporaneous literature in Sanskrit and Kannada and the notes of the Arab travellers. [9] Theories about the dynastic lineage ( Surya Vamsa —Solar line and Chandra Vamsa —Lunar line), the native region and the ancestral home have been proposed, based on information gleaned from inscriptions, royal emblems, the ancient clan names such as ""Rashtrika"", epithets (Ratta, Rashtrakuta, Lattalura Puravaradhiswara), the names of princes and princesses of the dynasty, and clues from relics such as coins. [7] [10] Scholars debate over which ethnic/linguistic groups can claim the early Rashtrakutas. Possibilities include the Kannadiga , [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Reddi , [16] the Maratha , [17] [18] the tribes from the Punjab region , [19] or other north western ethnic groups of India. [20]
Scholars however concur that the rulers of the imperial dynasty in the 8th to 10th century made the Kannada language as important as Sanskrit. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use both Kannada and Sanskrit (historians Sheldon Pollock and Jan Houben claim they are mostly in Kannada), [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] and the rulers encouraged literature in both languages. The earliest existing Kannada literary writings are credited to their court poets and royalty. [26] [27] [28] [29] Though these Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas , [15] [7] [30] [31] [32] [33] [11] they were conversant in a northern Deccan language as well. [34]
The heart of the Rashtrakuta empire included nearly all of Karnataka , Maharashtra and parts of Andhra Pradesh , an area which the Rashtrakutas ruled for over two centuries. The Samangadh copper plate grant (753) confirms that the feudatory King Dantidurga , who probably ruled from Achalapura in Berar (modern Elichpur in Maharashtra), defeated the great Karnatic army (referring to the army of the Badami Chalukyas ) of Kirtivarman II of Badami in 753 and took control of the northern regions of the Chalukya empire. [35] [36] [37] He then helped his son-in-law, Pallava King Nandivarman II regain Kanchi from the Chalukyas and defeated the Gurjaras, and the rulers of Kalinga , Kosala and Srisailam . [38] [39]
Dantidurga's successor Krishna I brought major portions of present-day Karnataka and Konkan under his control. [40] [41] During the rule of Dhruva Dharavarsha who took control in 780, the kingdom expanded into an empire that encompassed all of the territory between the Kaveri River and Central India . [40] [42] [43] [44] He led successful expeditions to Kannauj, the seat of northern Indian power where he defeated the Pratiharas and the Palas of Bengal, gaining him fame and vast booty but not more territory. He also brought the Eastern Chalukyas and Gangas of Talakad under his control. [40] [45] According to Altekar and Sen, the Rashtrakutas became a pan-India power during his rule. [44] [46]
Expansion
class=notpageimage|
The Rashtrakutas and neighbouring polities in South Asia circa 800 CE. [47]
The ascent of Dhruva Dharavarsha's third son, Govinda III , to the throne heralded an era of success like never before. [48] There is uncertainty about the location of the early capital of the Rashtrakutas at this time. [49] [50] [51] During his rule there was a three way conflict between the Rashtrakutas, the Palas and the Pratiharas for control over the Gangetic plains. Describing his victories over the Pratihara Emperor Nagabhatta II and the Pala Emperor Dharmapala , [40] the Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III drank from the icy waters of the Himalayan streams and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the Ganges . [52] [53] His military exploits have been compared to those of Alexander the Great and Arjuna of Mahabharata . [54] Having conquered Kannauj, he travelled south, took firm hold over Gujarat, Kosala ( Kaushal ), Gangavadi , humbled the Pallavas of Kanchi, installed a ruler of his choice in Vengi and received two statues as an act of submission from the king of Ceylon (one statue of the king and another of his minister). The Cholas, the Pandyas and the Kongu Cheras of Karur all paid him tribute. [55] [56] [57] [58] As one historian puts it, the drums of the Deccan were heard from the Himalayan caves to the shores of the Malabar Coast. [54] The Rashtrakutas empire now spread over the areas from Cape Comorin to Kannauj and from Banaras to Bharuch . [59] [60]
The successor of Govinda III, Amoghavarsha I made Manyakheta his capital and ruled a large empire. Manyakheta remained the Rashtrakutas' regal capital until the end of the empire. [61] [62] [63] He came to the throne in 814 but it was not until 821 that he had suppressed revolts from feudatories and ministers. Amoghavarsha I made peace with the Western Ganga dynasty by giving them his two daughters in marriage, and then defeated the invading Eastern Chalukyas at Vingavalli and assumed the title Viranarayana. [64] [65] His rule was not as militant as that of Govinda III as he preferred to maintain friendly relations with his neighbours, the Gangas, the Eastern Chalukyas and the Pallavas with whom he also cultivated marital ties. His era was an enriching one for the arts, literature and religion. Widely seen as the most famous of the Rashtrakuta Emperors, Amoghavarsha I was an accomplished scholar in Kannada and Sanskrit. [66] [67] His Kavirajamarga is considered an important landmark in Kannada poetics and Prashnottara Ratnamalika in Sanskrit is a writing of high merit and was later translated into the Tibetan language. [68] Because of his religious temperament, his interest in the arts and literature and his peace-loving nature, he has been compared to the emperor Ashoka and called ""Ashoka of the South"". [69]
During the rule of Krishna II , the empire faced a revolt from the Eastern Chalukyas and its size decreased to the area including most of the Western Deccan and Gujarat. [70] Krishna II ended the independent status of the Gujarat branch and brought it under direct control from Manyakheta. Indra III recovered the dynasty's fortunes in central India by defeating the Kingdom of Malwa and then invaded the doab region of the Ganges and Jamuna rivers. He also defeated the dynasty's traditional enemies, the Pratiharas and the Palas, while maintaining his influence over Vengi . [70] [71] [72] The effect of his victories in Kannauj lasted several years according to the 930 copper plate inscription of Emperor Govinda IV . [73] [74] After a succession of weak kings during whose reigns the empire lost control of territories in the north and east, Krishna III the last great ruler consolidated the empire so that it stretched from the Narmada River to Kaveri River and included the northern Tamil country (Tondaimandalam) while levying tribute on the king of Ceylon. [75] [76] [77] [78] [79]
Decline
In 972 CE., [80] during the rule of Khottiga Amoghavarsha , the Malwa King Siyaka Harsha attacked the empire and plundered Manyakheta, the capital of the Rashtrakutas. This seriously undermined the reputation of the Rastrakuta Empire and consequently led to its downfall. [81] The final decline was sudden as Tailapa II , a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta ruling from Tardavadi province in modern Bijapur district , declared himself independent by taking advantage of this defeat. [82] [83] Indra IV, the last emperor, committed Sallekhana (fasting unto death practised by Jain monks) at Shravanabelagola . With the fall of the Rashtrakutas, their feudatories and related clans in the Deccan and northern India declared independence. The Western Chalukyas annexed Manyakheta and made it their capital until 1015 and built an impressive empire in the Rashtrakuta heartland during the 11th century. The focus of dominance shifted to the Krishna River – Godavari River doab called Vengi . The former feudatories of the Rashtrakutas in western Deccan were brought under control of the Chalukyas, and the hitherto-suppressed Cholas of Tanjore became their arch enemies in the south. [84]
In conclusion, the rise of Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta had a great impact on India, even on India's north. Sulaiman (851), Al-Masudi (944) and Ibn Khurdadba (912) wrote that their empire was the largest in contemporary India and Sulaiman further called it one among the four great contemporary empires of the world. [85] [86] [87] According to the travelogues of the Arabs Al Masudi and Ibn Khordidbih of the 10th century, ""most of the kings of Hindustan turned their faces towards the Rashtrakuta king while they were praying, and they prostrated themselves before his ambassadors. The Rashtrakuta king was known as the ""King of kings"" (Rajadhiraja) who possessed the mightiest of armies and whose domains extended from Konkan to Sind."" [88] Some historians have called these times an ""Age of Imperial Kannauj"". Since the Rashtrakutas successfully captured Kannauj, levied tribute on its rulers and presented themselves as masters of North India, the era could also be called the ""Age of Imperial Karnataka"". [87] During their political expansion into central and northern India in the 8th to the 10th centuries, the Rashtrakutas or their relatives created several kingdoms that either ruled during the reign of the parent empire or continued to rule for centuries after its fall or came to power much later. Well known among these were the Rashtrakutas of Gujarat (757–888), [89] the Rattas of Saundatti (875–1230) in modern Karnataka, [90] the Gahadavalas of Kannauj (1068–1223), [91] the Rashtrakutas of Rajasthan (known as Rajputana) and ruling from Hastikundi or Hathundi (893–996), [92] Dahal (near Jabalpur ), [93] Rathores of Mandore (near Jodhpur ), the Rathores of Dhanop, [94] Rashtraudha dynasty of Mayuragiri in modern Maharashtra [95] and Rashtrakutas of Kannauj. [96] Rajadhiraja Chola 's conquest of the island of Ceylon in the early 11th century CE led to the fall of four kings there. According to historian K. Pillay, one of them, King Madavarajah of the Jaffna kingdom , was an usurper from the Rashtrakuta dynasty. [97]
Administration
e
Inscriptions and other literary records indicate the Rashtrakutas selected the crown prince based on heredity. The crown did not always pass on to the eldest son. Abilities were considered more important than age and chronology of birth, as exemplified by the crowning of Govinda III who was the third son of king Dhruva Dharavarsha. The most important position under the king was the Chief Minister (Mahasandhivigrahi) whose position came with five insignia commensurate with his position namely, a flag, a conch, a fan, a white umbrella, a large drum and five musical instruments called Panchamahashabdas. Under him was the commander (Dandanayaka), the foreign minister (Mahakshapataladhikrita) and a prime minister (Mahamatya or Purnamathya), all of whom were usually associated with one of the feudatory kings and must have held a position in government equivalent to a premier. [98] A Mahasamantha was a feudatory or higher ranking regal officer. All cabinet ministers were well versed in political science (Rajneeti) and possessed military training. There were cases where women supervised significant areas as when Revakanimaddi, daughter of Amoghavarsha I , administered Edathore Vishaya.
The kingdom was divided into Mandala or Rashtras (provinces). A Rashtra was ruled by a Rashtrapathi who on occasion was the emperor himself. Amoghavarsha I's empire had sixteen Rashtras. Under a Rashtra was a Vishaya (district) overseen by a Vishayapathi. Trusted ministers sometimes ruled more than a Rashtra. For example, Bankesha, a commander of Amoghavarsha I headed several Rashtras, besides ruling Banavasi which included 12,000 villages in that territory, lesser Rashtras included: Kunduru (500), Belvola (300), Puligere (300) and Kundarge (70). Below the Vishaya was the Nadu looked after by the Nadugowda (or Nadugavunda); sometimes there were two such officials, one assuming the position through heredity and another appointed centrally. The lowest division was a Grama or village administered by a Gramapathi or Prabhu Gavunda. [99]
The Rashtrakuta army consisted of large contingents of infantry, horsemen, and elephants. A standing army was always ready for war in a cantonment (Sthirabhuta Kataka) in the regal capital of Manyakheta. Large armies were also maintained by the feudatory kings who were expected to contribute to the defense of the empire in case of war. Chieftains and all the officials also served as commanders whose postings were transferable if the need arose. [100]
The Rashtrakutas issued coins (minted in an Akkashale) such as Suvarna, Drammas in silver and gold weighing 65 grains , Kalanju weighing 48 grains, Gadyanaka weighing 96 grains, Kasu weighing 15 grains, Manjati with 2.5 grains and Akkam of 1.25 grain. [101]
Economy
Main article: Economy of Rashtrakuta empire of Manyakheta
Kashivishvanatha temple at Pattadakal , Karnataka
The Rashtrakuta economy was sustained by its natural and agricultural produce, its manufacturing revenues and moneys gained from its conquests. Cotton was the chief crop of the regions of southern Gujarat, Khandesh and Berar. Minnagar, Gujarat, Ujjain , Paithan and Tagara were important centres of textile industry. Muslin cloth were manufactured in Paithan and Warangal . The cotton yarn and cloth was exported from Bharoch . White calicos were manufactured in Burhanpur and Berar and exported to Persia , Byzantines , Khazaria , Arabia and Egypt . [102] The Konkan region, ruled by the feudatory Silharas, produced large quantities of betel leaves, coconut and rice while the lush forests of Mysore, ruled by the feudatory Gangas , produced such woods as sandal, timber, teak and ebony. Incense and perfumes were exported from the ports of Thana and Saimur. [103]
The Deccan was rich in minerals, though its soil was not as fertile as that of the Gangetic plains. The copper mines of Cudappah , Bellary , Chanda, Buldhana, Narsingpur, Ahmadnagar , Bijapur and Dharwar were an important source of income and played an important role in the economy. [104] Diamonds were mined in Cudappah, Bellary, Kurnool and Golconda ; the capital Manyakheta and Devagiri were important diamond and jewellery trading centres. The leather industry and tanning flourished in Gujarat and some regions of northern Maharashtra. Mysore with its vast elephant herds was important for the ivory industry. [105]
The Rashtrakuta empire controlled most of the western sea board of the subcontinent which facilitated its maritime trade. [103] The Gujarat branch of the empire earned a significant income from the port of Bharoch, one of the most prominent ports in the world at that time. [106] The empire's chief exports were cotton yarn, cotton cloth, muslins, hides, mats, indigo, incense, perfumes, betel nuts , coconuts, sandal, teak, timber, sesame oil and ivory. Its major imports were pearls, gold, dates from Arabia, slaves, Italian wines, tin, lead, topaz , storax , sweet clover, flint glass, antimony , gold and silver coins, singing boys and girls (for the entertainment of the royalty) from other lands. Trading in horses was an important and profitable business, monopolised by the Arabs and some local merchants. [107] The Rashtrakuta government levied a shipping tax of one golden Gadyanaka on all foreign vessels embarking to any other ports and a fee of one silver Ctharna ( a coin) on vessels travelling locally. [108]
Artists and craftsman operated as corporations (guilds) rather than as individual business. Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription refers to an assemblage of all the people of a district headed by the guilds of the region. [109] Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses. [110]
The government's income came from five principal sources: regular taxes, occasional taxes, fines, income taxes, miscellaneous taxes and tributes from feudatories. [111] An emergency tax was imposed occasionally and were applicable when the kingdom was under duress, such as when it faced natural calamities, or was preparing for war or overcoming war's ravages. Income tax included taxes on crown land , wasteland, specific types of trees considered valuable to the economy, mines, salt, treasures unearthed by prospectors. [112] Additionally, customary presents were given to the king or royal officers on such festive occasions as marriage or the birth of a son. [113]
The king determined the tax levels based on need and circumstances in the kingdom while ensuring that an undue burden was not placed on the peasants. [114] The land owner or tenant paid a variety of taxes, including land taxes, produce taxes and payment of the overhead for maintenance of the Gavunda (village head). Land taxes were varied, based on type of land, its produce and situation and ranged from 8% to 16%. A Banavasi inscription of 941 mentions reassessment of land tax due to the drying up of an old irrigation canal in the region. [115] The land tax may have been as high as 20% to pay for expenses of a military frequently at war. [116] In most of the kingdom, land taxes were paid in goods and services and rarely was cash accepted. [117] A portion of all taxes earned by the government (usually 15%) was returned to the villages for maintenance. [115]
Taxes were levied on artisans such as potters, sheep herders, weavers, oilmen, shopkeepers, stall owners, brewers and gardeners. Taxes on perishable items such as fish, meat, honey, medicine, fruits and essentials like fuel was as high as 16%. [108] Taxes on salt and minerals were mandatory although the empire did not claim sole ownership of mines, implying that private mineral prospecting and the quarrying business may have been active. [118] The state claimed all such properties whose deceased legal owner had no immediate family to make an inheritance claim. [119] Other miscellaneous taxes included ferry and house taxes. Only Brahmins and their temple institutions were taxed at a lower rate. [120]
Culture
Religion
The Rashtrakuta kings supported the popular religions of the day in the traditional spirit of religious tolerance. [121] Scholars have offered various arguments regarding which specific religion the Rashtrakutas favoured, basing their evidence on inscriptions , coins and contemporary literature. Some claim the Rashtrakutas were inclined towards Jainism since many of the scholars who flourished in their courts and wrote in Sanskrit , Kannada and a few in Apabhramsha and Prakrit were Jains. [122] The Rashtrakutas built well-known Jain temples at locations such as Lokapura in Bagalkot district and their loyal feudatory, the Western Ganga Dynasty , built Jain monuments at Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli . Scholars have suggested that Jainism was a principal religion at the very heart of the empire, modern Karnataka, accounting for more than 30% of the population and dominating the culture of the region. [123] King Amoghavarsha I was a disciple of the Jain acharya Jinasena and wrote in his religious writing, Prashnottara Ratnamalika, ""having bowed to Varaddhamana ( Mahavira ), I write Prashnottara Ratnamalika"". The mathematician Mahaviracharya wrote in his Ganita Sarasangraha, ""The subjects under Amoghavarsha are happy and the land yields plenty of grain. May the kingdom of King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha, follower of Jainism ever increase far and wide."" Amoghavarsha may have taken up Jainism in his old age. [124] [125]
However, the Rashtrakuta kings also patronized Hinduism 's followers of the Shaiva , Vaishnava and Shakta faiths. Almost all of their inscriptions begin with an invocation to god Vishnu or god Shiva . The Sanjan inscriptions tell of King Amoghavarsha I sacrificing a finger from his left hand at the Lakshmi temple at Kolhapur to avert a calamity in his kingdom. King Dantidurga performed the Hiranyagarbha (horse sacrifice) and the Sanjan and Cambay plates of King Govinda IV mention Brahmins performing such rituals as Rajasuya , Vajapeya and Agnishtoma. [126] An early copper plate grant of King Dantidurga (753) shows an image of god Shiva and the coins of his successor, King Krishna I (768), bear the legend Parama Maheshwara (another name for Shiva). The kings' titles such as Veeranarayana showed their Vaishnava leanings. Their flag had the sign of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, perhaps copied from the Badami Chalukyas. [127] The famous Kailasnatha temple at Ellora and other rock-cut caves attributed to them show that the Hinduism was flourishing. [126] Their family deity was a goddess by name Latana (also known as Rashtrashyena, Manasa Vindyavasini) who took the form of a falcon to save the kingdom. [128] They built temples with icons and ornamentation that satisfied the needs of different faiths. The temple at Salotgi was meant for followers of Shiva and Vishnu and the temple at Kargudri was meant for worshipers of Shiva, Vishnu and Bhaskara ( Surya , the sun god). [122]
In short, the Rashtrakuta rule was tolerant to multiple popular religions, Jainism , Vaishnavaism and Shaivism. Buddhism too found support and was popular in places such as Dambal and Balligavi , although it had declined significantly by this time. [2] The decline of Buddhism in South India began in the 8th century with the spread of Adi Shankara 's Advaita philosophy. [129] Islamic contact with South India began as early as the 7th century, a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and Arab lands. Jumma Masjids existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century [130] and many Muslims lived and mosques flourished on the coasts, specifically in towns such as Kayalpattanam and Nagore . Muslim settlers married local women; their children were known as Mappilas (Moplahs) and were actively involved in horse trading and manning shipping fleets. [131]
Society

Chronicles mention more castes than the four commonly known castes in the Hindu social system, some as many as seven castes. [132] Al-Biruni , the famed 10th century Persian / central Asian Indologist mentions sixteen castes including the four basic castes of Brahmins , Kshatriya , Vaishya and Sudras . [133] The Zakaya or Lahud caste consisted of communities specialising in dance and acrobatics. [134] People in the professions of sailing, hunting, weaving, cobblery, basket making and fishing belonged to specific castes or subcastes. The Antyajas caste provided many menial services to the wealthy. Brahmins enjoyed the highest status in Rashtrakuta society; only those Kshatriyas in the Sat-Kshatriya sub-caste (noble Kshatriyas) were higher in status. [135] [136]
The careers of Brahmins usually related to education, the judiciary, astrology, mathematics, poetry and philosophy [137] or the occupation of hereditary administrative posts. [138] Also Brahmins increasingly practiced non-Brahminical professions (agriculture, trade in betel nuts and martial posts). [139] Capital punishment, although widespread, was not given to the royal Kshatriya sub-castes or to Brahmins found guilty of heinous crimes (as the killing of a Brahmin in medieval Hindu India was itself considered a heinous crime). As an alternate punishment to enforce the law a Brahmin's right hand and left foot was severed, leaving that person disabled. [140]
By the 9th century, kings from all the four castes had occupied the highest seat in the monarchical system in Hindu India. [141] Admitting Kshatriyas to Vedic schools along with Brahmins was customary, but the children of the Vaishya and Shudra castes were not allowed. Landownership by people of all castes is recorded in inscriptions [142] Intercaste marriages in the higher castes were only between highly placed Kshatriya girls and Brahmin boys, [143] but was relatively frequent among other castes. [144] Intercaste functions were rare and dining together between people of various castes was avoided. [145]
Joint families were the norm but legal separations between brothers and even father and son have been recorded in inscriptions. [146] Women and daughters had rights over property and land as there are inscriptions recording the sale of land by women. [147] The arranged marriage system followed a strict policy of early marriage for women. Among Brahmins, boys married at or below 16 years of age and the brides chosen for them were 12 or younger. This age policy was not strictly followed by other castes. [148] Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow would immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre ) was practiced but the few examples noted in inscriptions were mostly in the royal families. [149] The system of shaving the heads of widows was infrequent as epigraphs note that widows were allowed to grow their hair but decorating it was discouraged. [150] The remarriage of a widow was rare among the upper castes and more accepted among the lower castes. [151]
In the general population men wore two simple pieces of cloth, a loose garment on top and a garment worn like a dhoti for the lower part of the body. Only kings could wear turbans , a practice that spread to the masses much later. [152] Dancing was a popular entertainment and inscriptions speak of royal women being charmed by dancers, both male and female, in the king's palace. Devadasis (girls were ""married"" to a deity or temple) were often present in temples. [153] Other recreational activities included attending animal fights of the same or different species. The Atakur inscription ( hero stone , virgal) was made for the favourite hound of the feudatory Western Ganga King Butuga II that died fighting a wild boar in a hunt. [154] There are records of game preserves for hunting by royalty. Astronomy and astrology were well developed as subjects of study, [154] and there were many superstitious beliefs such as catching a snake alive proved a woman's chastity. Old persons suffering from incurable diseases preferred to end their lives by drowning in the sacred waters of a pilgrim site or by a ritual burning. [155]
Literature
Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal , Karnataka
Kannada became more prominent as a literary language during the Rashtrakuta rule with its script and literature showing remarkable growth, dignity and productivity. [24] [27] [29] This period effectively marked the end of the classical Prakrit and Sanskrit era. Court poets and royalty created eminent works in Kannada and Sanskrit that spanned such literary forms as prose, poetry, rhetoric, the Hindu epics and the life history of Jain tirthankars . Bilingual writers such as Asaga gained fame, [156] and noted scholars such as the Mahaviracharya wrote on pure mathematics in the court of King Amoghavarsha I. [157] [158]
Kavirajamarga (850) by King Amoghavarsha I is the earliest available book on rhetoric and poetics in Kannada, [67] [68] though it is evident from this book that native styles of Kannada composition had already existed in previous centuries. [159] Kavirajamarga is a guide to poets (Kavishiksha) that aims to standardize these various styles. The book refers to early Kannada prose and poetry writers such as Durvinita , perhaps the 6th-century monarch of Western Ganga dynasty . [160] [161] [162]
The Jain writer Adikavi Pampa , widely regarded as one of the most influential Kannada writers, became famous for Adipurana (941). Written in champu (mixed prose-verse style) style, it is the life history of the first Jain tirthankara Rishabhadeva . Pampa's other notable work was Vikramarjuna Vijaya (941), the author's version of the Hindu epic, Mahabharata , with Arjuna as the hero. [163] Also called Pampa Bharata, it is a eulogy of the writer's patron, King Chalukya Arikeseri of Vemulawada (a Rashtrakuta feudatory), comparing the king's virtues favorably to those of Arjuna. Pampa demonstrates such a command of classical Kannada that scholars over the centuries have written many interpretations of his work. [164]
Another notable Jain writer in Kannada was Sri Ponna , patronised by King Krishna III and famed for Shantipurana, his account of the life of Shantinatha, the 16th Jain tirthankara. He earned the title Ubhaya Kavichakravathi (supreme poet in two languages) for his command over both Kannada and Sanskrit. His other writings in Kannada were Bhuvanaika-ramaabhyudaya, Jinaksharamale and Gatapratyagata. [67] [165] Adikavi Pampa and Sri Ponna are called ""gems of Kannada literature"". [163]
A stanza from the 9th century Kannada classic Kavirajamarga , praising the people for their literary skills
Prose works in Sanskrit was prolific during this era as well. [27] Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by Mahaviracharya , a native of Gulbarga , who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition and was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I. [157] His greatest contribution was Ganitasarasangraha, a writing in 9 chapters. Somadevasuri of 950 wrote in the court of Arikesari II , a feudatory of Rashtrakuta Krishna III in Vemulavada . He was the author of Yasastilaka champu , Nitivakyamrita and other writings. The main aim of the champu writing was to propagate Jain tenets and ethics. The second writing reviews the subject matter of Arthashastra from the standpoint of Jain morals in a clear and pithy manner. [166] Ugraditya, a Jain ascetic from Hanasoge in the modern Mysore district wrote a medical treatise called Kalyanakaraka. He delivered a discourse in the court of Amoghavarsha I encouraging abstinence from animal products and alcohol in medicine. [167] [168]
Trivikrama was a noted scholar in the court of King Indra III. His classics were Nalachampu (915), the earliest in champu style in Sanskrit, Damayanti Katha, Madalasachampu and Begumra plates. Legend has it that Goddess Saraswati helped him in his effort to compete with a rival in the king's court. [166] Jinasena was the spiritual preceptor and guru of Amoghavarsha I . A theologian, his contributions are Dhavala and Jayadhavala (written with another theologian Virasena ). These writings are named after their patron king who was also called Athishayadhavala. Other contributions from Jinasena were Adipurana, later completed by his disciple Gunabhadra, Harivamsha and Parshvabhyudaya. [157]

Kailasanath Temple at Ellora, Maharashtra
The Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage of the Deccan. Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools: Ellora, around Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal, and at Sirval near Gulbarga. [169] The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day Maharashtra . The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show Pandyan influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods. [170]
The Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re-dedicated the rock-cut shrines. Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at Ellora ascribed to his period. [171] The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at Ellora is their creation of the monolithic Kailasanath Temple , a splendid achievement confirming the ""Balhara"" status as ""one among the four principal Kings of the world"". [86] The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including Ravana , Shiva and Parvathi while the ceilings have paintings.
The Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan. The architectural style used is Karnata Dravida according to Adam Hardy. It does not contain any of the Shikharas common to the Nagara style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka. [172] [173] According to art historian Vincent Smith, the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock-cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world. [174] According to art historian Percy Brown, as an accomplishment of art, the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture, a monument that has always excited and astonished travellers. [175]

While some scholars have claimed the architecture at Elephanta is attributable to the Kalachuri , others claim that it was built during the Rashtrakuta period. [176] Some of the sculptures such as Nataraja and Sadashiva excel in beauty and craftsmanship even that of the Ellora sculptures. [177] Famous sculptures at Elephanta include Ardhanarishvara and Maheshamurthy. The latter, a three faced bust of Lord Shiva, is 25 feet (8 m) tall and considered one of the finest pieces of sculpture in India. It is said that, in the world of sculpture, few works of art depicting a divinity are as balanced. [178]
In Karnataka their most famous temples are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal , a UNESCO World Heritage site. [179] [180] Other well-known temples are the Parameshwara temple at Konnur, Brahmadeva temple at Savadi, the Settavva, Kontigudi II, Jadaragudi and Ambigeragudi temples at Aihole , Mallikarjuna temple at Ron, Andhakeshwara temple at Huli ( Hooli ), Someshwara temple at Sogal , Jain temples at Lokapura, Navalinga temple at Kuknur , Kumaraswamy temple at Sandur, numerous temples at Shirival in Gulbarga , [181] and the Trikuteshwara temple at Gadag which was later expanded by Kalyani Chalukyas . Archeological study of these temples show some have the stellar (multigonal) plan later to be used profusely by the Hoysalas at Belur and Halebidu . [182] One of the richest traditions in Indian architecture took shape in the Deccan during this time which Adam Hardy calls Karnata dravida style as opposed to traditional Dravida style. [183]
Language
9th century Old Kannada inscription at Navalinga temple in Kuknur , Karnataka
With the ending of the Gupta dynasty in northern India in the early 6th century, major changes began taking place in the Deccan south of the Vindyas and in the southern regions of India. These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of peninsular India (outside of Tamilakam ) interfaced between the increasing use of the local Kannada language and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, including those that were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit. [22] [23] Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land. [184] The local language formed the desi (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more marga (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning (ghatikas) taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the devotional movements of later centuries. [185]
Contemporaneous literature and inscriptions show that Kannada was not only popular in the modern Karnataka region but had spread further north into present day southern Maharashtra and to the northern Deccan by the 8th century. [186] Kavirajamarga, the work on poetics, refers to the entire region between the Kaveri River and the Godavari River as "" Kannada country"". [187] [188] [189] Higher education in Sanskrit included the subjects of Veda , Vyakarana (grammar), Jyotisha (astronomy and astrology), Sahitya (literature), Mimansa (Exegesis), Dharmashastra (law), Puranas (ritual), and Nyaya (logic). An examination of inscriptions from this period shows that the Kavya (classical) style of writing was popular. The awareness of the merits and defects in inscriptions by the archivists indicates that even they, though mediocre poets, had studied standard classical literature in Sanskrit. [190] An inscription in Kannada by King Krishna III , written in a poetic Kanda metre, has been found as far away as Jabalpur in modern Madhya Pradesh . [21] Kavirajamarga, a work on poetics in Kannada by Amoghavarsha I , shows that the study of poetry was popular in the Deccan during this time. Trivikrama's Sanskrit writing, Nalachampu, is perhaps the earliest in the champu style from the Deccan. [191]

Incredible India
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
International tourism campaign
2002; 23 years ago (2002)
Budget
www.incredibleindia.gov.in
Incredible India (stylized as Incredıble!ndıa) is the name of an international tourism campaign launched by the Government of India in 2002 to promote tourism in India . The ""Incredible India"" title was officially branded and promoted since 2002. The exclamation mark forms the 'I' of India. The exclamation used creatively across several visuals complements the concept behind the word ""Incredible"". [2] [3]
Marketing campaign
[ edit ]
In 1972, Sunil Dutt launched a campaign to promote India as a popular tourist destination. [4] The phrase ""Incredible India"" was adopted as a slogan by the ministry. Before 2002, the Government of India had regularly formulated policies and prepared pamphlets and brochures for the promotion of tourism, however, it had not supported tourism in a concerted fashion. In 2002, the Ministry of Tourism made a conscious effort to bring in more professionalism in its attempts to promote tourism. It formulated an integrated communication strategy with the aim of promoting India as a destination of choice for the discerning traveller. The tourism ministry engaged the services of advertising and marketing firm Ogilvy & Mather (O&M) India to create a new campaign to increase tourist inflows into the country. [5]
The campaign portrayed India as an attractive tourist destination by showcasing different aspects of Indian culture and history like yoga and spirituality . The campaign was conducted globally and received appreciation from tourism industry observers and travellers alike. However, the campaign also attracted criticism from some quarters. Some observers felt that it had failed to cover several aspects of India which would have been attractive to the average tourist. [6]
In 2008, the Ministry of Tourism launched a campaign targeted at the local population to educate them regarding good behaviour and etiquette when dealing with foreign tourists. Indian actor Aamir Khan was commissioned to endorse the campaign which was titled Atithi Devo Bhavaḥ , Sanskrit for ""Guests are like God"". Atithidevo Bhavaḥ was aimed at creating awareness about the effects of tourism and sensitising the local population about preservation of India's heritage, culture, cleanliness and hospitality. It also attempted to instil a sense of responsibility towards tourists and reinforce the confidence of foreign tourists towards India as a preferred holiday destination. The concept was designed to complement the Incredible India campaign. [7]
In 2009, Minister of tourism, Kumari Selja unveiled plans to extend the Incredible India campaign to the domestic tourism sector as well. US$ 12 million out of a total budget of US$200 million was allocated in 2009 for the purpose of promoting domestic tourism.
In 2015, Aamir Khan, whose comments on perceived intolerance in the country had created a controversy, ceased to be the mascot for the Incredible India campaign when the contract for it expired. [8] The new brand ambassador of Incredible India was Narendra Modi himself. [9] The veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan and actress Priyanka Chopra were chosen as the new brand ambassadors for the Incredible India campaign.
Impact on Indian tourism
[ edit ]
Maharajas' Express , a train which travels the famous Indian sites. The train was launched by IRCTC .
According to spending data released by Visa Asia Pacific in March 2006, India has emerged as the fastest growing market in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of international tourist spending. The data revealed that international tourists spent US$372 million in India in the fourth quarter (October–December) of 2005, 25% more than in the fourth quarter of 2004. China , which came second in the region, managed to raise US$784 million from international tourism in Q4 2005, a growth of 23% over its Q4 2004 figures. The tourist spending figures for India would have satisfied the Indian tourism ministry, which had been targeting the high-end market through its long running Incredible India communication campaign. [10]
Reception
[ edit ]
Indian travel industry analysts and tour operators were appreciative of the high standards of the Incredible India campaign. ""The promo campaign is making a powerful visual impact and creating a perception of India being a magical place to visit,"" said Anne Morgaon Scully, President, McCabe Bremer Travel, Virginia, U.S. Average travellers too appeared to find the campaign interesting and informative, going by favourable comments on blogs on travel websites. Although Incredible India was generally well received, industry observers differed in their opinions on the positioning of India in the campaign. GS Murari, Director, Fidelis Advertising and Marketing Private Ltd. stated that he was uncomfortable with the tagline ""Incredible India"" and was of the opinion that since India was not a uni-dimensional country like Singapore or the Maldives , using a word like 'incredible' to describe India as a whole was not appropriate. [11] In 2011, Arjun Sharma, managing director, Le Passage to India, stated that the campaign had lived its life and needed to be reinvented. [12] The Ministry of Tourism again engaged Ogilvy & Mather for a period of three years, starting in 2012, to redefine the brand and provide a strategic vision for the campaign.
In 2013, the Ministry of Tourism partnered with WoNoBo.com to launch Walking Tours, [13] an online experience where users navigate and route their way through cities based on a choice of themes.
In 2014, Tourism Secretary Parvez Dewan launched a personalised itinerary planner called Tripigator, [14] [15] a website aimed at providing all travel itineraries in one tab to reduce travellers' efforts.

Sita Ramachandraswamy temple
One of the gopurams of the temple
Religion
http://www.bhadrachalamonline.com
The Sri Sita Ramachandraswamy temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Rama , a prominent avatar of the god Vishnu . It is located on the banks of the Godavari River in the town of Bhadrachalam in east Telangana , India. Often simply referred to as Bhadrachalam or Bhadragiri, Bhadradri, the temple is considered one of the Divya Kshetrams of Godavari and is also revered as Dakshina Ayodhya .
The central icon features the four-armed Vaikuntha Rama, the form Vishnu appeared in to answer Bhadra'a prayers. Rama's consort Sita and brother Lakshmana form part of the central icon. By some accounts the Bhadrachalam temple was built, and other accounts repaired by the legendary Bhakti saint Kancherla Gopanna – also known as Bhadrachala Ramadasu – in the 17th century. Gopana was the revenue officer of Bhadrachalam under the reign of the last Sultan of Golconda, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (Tana Shah). Gopana was accused and arrested of using funds meant for the Sultanate treasury to build the Sita Ramachandraswamy temple. He spent 12 years in jail, where he composed bhakti songs still sung at this temple. Before Golconda Sultanate collapsed during Aurangzeb's expansion of the Mughal control of the Deccan region, Gopana was released by Sultan Tana Shah when Lord Rama himself appeared with Lakshmana to pay the gold coins Sultan demanded for Gopana's release. Gopana then continued to compose poems dedicated to Rama in this temple.
After Gopanna, Tumu Lakshmi Narasimha Dasu and Varada Ramadasu looked after the temple's rituals. Bhadrachalam follows the Vaishnavite Pancharatra Agama tradition, and its system of worship is modelled on that of the Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam. The temple has four entrances; the Rajagopuram is located at the northern entrance, which is called the Vaikuntha Dwaram. The temple houses a number of sub-shrines and a few mandapams.
Bhadrachalam is notable for its principal deity Rama. Gopanna used Bhadrachalam as a centre of the Bhajan tradition to spread awareness of the Vaishnavite tradition. The annual Brahmotsavam is the biggest festival celebrated in Bhadrachalam; the key event is the Sri Sitarama Thirukalyana Mahotsavam, or the marriage of Rama and Sita on the eve of Rama Navami . Other important festivals celebrated in Bhadrachalam are Vaikuntha Ekadashi , Vasanthotsavam, and Vijayadashami .
Legends
[ edit ]
The temple is one of several in India linked to the epic Ramayana legend about Bhadra. According to this legend, in the Treta Yuga , Rama ( avatar of the god Vishnu ), along with his consort Sita and brother Lakshmana , stayed in the Dandaka forest as a part of their fourteen-year exile. [1] Due to Rama's grace, a stone turned into a human called Bhadra, who was considered the son of Mount Meru . Devoted to Rama, Bhadra later met the sage Narada , who initiated an upadesam (instruction) of the Rama Taraka mantra . Bhadra mediated and chanted the mantra on the banks of the Godavari River for several years. Pleased, Rama promised to return to meet Bhadra when he had found Sita, who had been abducted by the demon king Ravana . However, Rama failed to fulfill his promise in his lifetime. [1]
Later, Vishnu was pleased with Bhadra's devotion. To fulfill the promise his Rama avatar had made, he appeared before Bhadra in the form of Rama. In a hurry, Vishnu forgot that Rama was a mortal with two arms and appeared with his four celestial arms. [2] Rama in upper arms held a shankha (conch) and the Sudarshana Chakra (discus) and a bow and an arrow in his lower hands. Sita was seated on his left thigh and Lakshmana stood to his left. All three faced west towards the Godavari River. [1] Rama held the conch in his right upper hand in contrast to Vishnu, with the intention of giving salvation to Bhadra. [3] This Bhadra legend is the mythology behind Bhadrachalam as well as other Bhadra-prefixed locations and temples in India.
Some attribute the sanctum's statue with Rama with Sita seated in his lap and brother Lakshmana standing next to him to another local legend. This legend states that a tribal woman living in Bhadrareddypalem named Pokala Dhammakka found the central icon of Rama in an anthill. Pokala Dhammakka is also believed to be a descendant of Sabari . [4] The story goes that deity was present in the jungle, and this was revealed to the pious Dhammakka in a dream. [4] She went to the jungle location, dissolved the anthill using the water from the Godavari River and did puja to the deities. [4] With the help of the villagers, Dhammakka constructed a mandapam (hall) and offered prayers to the deities. [5]
History
[ edit ]
A statue of Bhadrachalam Ramadasu (Kancherla Gopanna) in Bhadrachalam
The history of the temple is closely linked to the history of Kancherla Gopanna . He was born in Nelakondapalli village of Telangana. His maternal uncle worked for Golconda Sultanate. As a famine swept through the region, the uncle appealed to the Sultan to give his nephew a job. Gopana was appointed as the tehsildar (revenue officer) of Bhadrachalam. [6] During the reign of Abul Hasan Qutb Shah – the last Sultan of Golconda (1672-1686) – under his orders, Gopanna enforced the Jaziya religious tax, a penalty designed to force Hindus to adopt Islam. [7] Gopanna received harsh criticism from the local Hindus for enforcing the tax. Dejected by numerous rebuffs, Gopanna decided to use a portion of the tax for the temple and face the consequences. [7] According to one version, Gopana built the temple using the taxes he collected. In another version, observing the dilapidated state of the temple, Gopanna repaired the temple for Rama with those taxes, and tried to offset the spent taxes by raising donations. [8]
The temple was completed in second half of the 17th century at a cost of nearly six lakh varahas. [a] [11]
After learning the truth, the Shah was enraged, and Gopanna was summoned to the court. Gopanna explained that he never intended to misuse the treasury funds and planned to reimburse using donations he expected to receive in the future. [11] The Shah ordered his soldiers to hang Gopanna if the sum was not repaid within twelve years, and imprisoned him. [11] On the last day of the twelfth year, [11] According to one version of events at the end of the 12 year term, Rama and Lakshmana appeared in Shah's dream and repaid the entire sum in Rama madas (gold coins with Rama's inscriptions on them). When the Shah woke up, he saw real gold coins and released Gopanna. [12] According to another version, the Shah also gave Gopanna a pension for life and donated the area around Bhadrachalam as an endowment to the temple. [6] According to The Hindu, an Indian newspaper, some scholars dismissed the idea of Rama paying the money, saying that ""Gopanna was imprisoned by his jealous enemies"", and the Shah freed Gopanna after a fair inquiry, then sent him back to Bhadrachalam with due honors. [11] All these stories lack historical evidence, because Gopanna's 12-year confinement in Golconda prison by the Shah lasted till mid 1680s, closely coinciding with the Shah's rule of 14 years and the fall of Golconda Sultanate. The last known Golconda documents from the Shah's era are from 1686, [13] and over 1686–87, the forces of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb attacked Golconda over 8 months, fought with Shah's forces, then dismissed the Shah and imprisoned him in Aurangabad, as Aurangzeb sought to expand his control of the Deccan region. [14] [15]
According to another myth published in Indian newspapers and local publications, the 15th century Kabirdas – a Muslim saint – toured Telangana singing bhakti songs of Rama. The dedication and charity of the 17th-century Gopanna so impressed Kabir, that he gave him the title of Ramadas (Rama's servant). [8]
According to the temple's history, after Gopana's death Tumu Lakshmi Narasimha Dasu of Guntur and his friend Varada Ramadasu of Kanchipuram offered prayers daily at Bhadrachalam and spent their life there. After Varada Ramadasu's death, Narasimha Dasu carried his corpse into the Godavari and died by drowning. [16]
Modern era
[ edit ]
The temple and the lands were administered by Hyderabad state. In 1860, though the surrounding lands were given to British, the temple was retained with Hyderabad state in Warangal (later Khammam) districts. The lands, though under British rule, the rights of the lands were held with Palwancha samsthanam of Nizam state. Later, the lands surrounding the temple were merged into Khammam district in 1959. [17] The temple's maintenance and administration were undertaken by the endowment ministry of the Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1958. Repairs were made to the temple in 1960 under the supervision of the then-endowments minister Kalluri Chandramouli . [18]
In August 1986 the temple faced a severe threat from flash floods in the Godavari River. The main streets and several structures, including cottages, were submerged in water for nearly five days. Many local people took shelter in the halls of the temple. The kalyana mandapam (marriage hall) was completely inundated except for its gopuram (temple tower). P. Seshacharyulu and other priests stayed in the temple and performed all the daily rituals without any interruption during the floods. [19]
During the Telangana movement , both the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh claimed that the Bhadrachalam temple belongs to their respective regions. Telangana politicians and activists stood firm on their stance and stated that they would not let Bhadrachalam be separated from the state. [20] [21] Bhadrachalam was retained in Telangana, and after reorganisation of districts in October 2016, the temple became a part of Bhadradri Kothagudem district . [22]
The temple
[ edit ]

The temple is divided into three parts. The first is believed to be the head of Bhadra, where a shrine is dedicated to him. [23] Inside, on a rock structure, the supposed footprints of Rama can be seen. [12] Thirunamam (a white clay) is applied to the rock so that the visitors can recognise it as Bhadra's head. [23] The second part of the temple is the sanctum where the central icon resides on a place considered equivalent to Bhadra's heart. The third part is the Rajagopuram (main tower), which is located at Bhadra's feet. [23]
The temple has four entrances; there are 50 steps to be climbed to reach the main entrance. [12] In 1974, a huge door named the Vaikuntha Dwaram was built to ensure proper management of the visiting devotees. [23] Directly opposite to the sanctum is a gold-plated dwajasthambam (flag post). [12] It is made of panchaloha (a five-metal alloy), on which are carved images of Garuda , the vehicle of Vishnu. [24] On the top of the vimana of the sanctum is an eight-faced Sudarshana Chakra with a thousand corners, that was engraved by Gopanna, who found it lying in the waters of the Godavari River. [25] On the vimana, a miniature of the temple's deity can be seen. [24] The entrance for devotees, who have purchased a special visit ticket, is towards the left of the sanctum. The regular visitors have to wait in a queue that leads straight into the sanctum. [12] Housed in an area to the right of the sanctum are the festival icons of Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana, which are worshipped daily. [24]
The central sanctum sanctorum of Bhadrachalam, with the Sudarshana Chakra at the top and the miniature of the temple's deity.
The central icon housed in the sanctum is considered Swayambhu (self-manifested). Rama is seated in a padmasana posture, with Sita seated on his lap. Rama's four hands hold the conch, disc, bow, and arrow. Lakshmana stands to his left. [12]
On a taller hill, Gopanna installed and consecrated the icon of Ranganatha , a reclining form of Vishnu, which faces the south. [23] The place is popularly known as Ranganayakula Gutta (hillock of Ranganatha). Opposite the Ranganatha sanctum is a temple dedicated to his consort Lakshmi Thayar . [12] These two temples were included by Gopanna to follow the tradition of Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple . [23] The temple houses a number of other shrines. Hanuman has two shrines in the temple: the Abhayanjaneya temple at the river bank and the Dasanjaneya temple in the Thiruveedhi (divine passage) of Bhadrachalam. [23] In the Rajaveedhi (royal passage) of the temple, a shrine of Govindaraja Swamy (a form of Vishnu) can be found where the festival icons of Bhadrachalam spend some time during the Thiruveedhi utsavam festival procession. [23] On the way to the main temple from the river bank, a shrine is dedicated to Yogananda- Narasimha . The icon is believed to be Swayambhu and very powerful. [23]
Next to the Lakshmi Thayar temple is the Rushya Mookham Exhibition centre. In the centre, the Rama mada coins given to the Shah, jewellery made by Gopanna for the deities, and other important items are housed. The jewellery includes the chintaku patakam (a necklace studded with rubies), kirithas (crowns), plaited decorations, and a mutyala haramu (chain of pearls). [12] In the outer ambulatory passage of the temple, there is a hall called the Nithyakalyana mandapam or kalyana mandapam, intended for conducting the marriage festival of Rama and Sita. [12] On the Ranganayakula Gutta is a temple dedicated to the god Shiva , who is worshipped as Ramalingeswaraswamy. [23] Near the kalyana mandapam, there is a hermitage named Govindaswamy matham where many saints stayed in the past. [23] A huge hall named Mithila Stadium was built facing the Vaikuntha Dwaram. Its construction was initiated by Jalagam Vengala Rao and was completed at a cost of ₹3.8 million. [23] The icons worshipped by Narasimha Dasu are housed in the Ambasatram, which is located at the southern end of the temple. Here, food is served to the devotees visiting the temple. [23]
Religious practices
[ edit ]
Bhadrachalam temple entrance
According to Ramayana and other sacred texts, Ranganatha was the Kuladevata (tutelary deity) of Rama's clan, the Ikshvaku dynasty . Hence, Gopanna wanted this temple to implement all the traditions and guidelines of the Srirangam temple dedicated to Ranganatha. [23] For the same reason, he invited five families from Srirangam who knew the Pancharatra Agama traditions to Bhadrachalam. With their help, the system of worship followed in the Srirangam temple was implemented here. [23] Narasimha Dasu later introduced the Dasavidhotsavams (ten kinds of rituals), including Nitya Kainkaryams (daily rituals), Vaarotsavams (weekly rituals), Pakshotsavams (fortnightly rituals), and Punarvasu utsavam (rituals on the Punarvasu day). [26]
The suprabhata seva (pre-dawn ritual) begins early in the morning at 4:00 am, followed by providing Balabhoga (minor food offerings) from 5:30 to 7:00 am. [27] From 8:30 to 11:30, the regular archana (prayer) activities are held. Rajabhogam (main food offering) is served to the deity from 11:30 am to 12:00 noon; then the temple remains closed until 3:00 pm. [27] From 3:00, the archana rituals continue, after which darbar seva (the king's court ritual) is performed from 7:00 to 8:00 pm. After a break to offer food to the deity from 8:30 to 9:00 pm, the temple is closed after performance of the pavalimpu seva (the sleeping ritual). [27] Abhisheka (anointment) in the main sanctum is performed only to Rama's feet on the rock structure in Bhadra's temple. [23] This ritual is also performed to the deities in the Lakshmi, Anjaneya, and Yogananda Narasimha temple exclusively on every Friday, Tuesday, and Saturday, respectively. [27] There are weekly, monthly, and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple apart from the annual ones. [27] Kalyanam (marriage) and Thiruveedhi utsavam (procession festival) are performed at the Ranganayakula Gutta every year for its presiding deity Ranganatha. [23]

Transport in India
hide
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Transport in India consists of transport by land , water and air . Road transport is the primary mode of transport for most Indian citizens, and India's road transport systems are among the most heavily used in the world.
The Golden Quadrilateral connects the four major metro cities of India, viz., Delhi ( north ), Kolkata ( east ), Chennai ( south ) and Mumbai ( west ).
India's road network is the second-largest, after the United States and one of the busiest in the world, transporting 8.225 billion passengers and over 980 million tonnes of cargo annually, as of 2015. [1] India's rail network is the fourth largest and second busiest in the world, transporting 8.09 billion passengers and 1.20 billion tonnes of freight annually, as of 2020. [update] [2] Aviation in India is broadly divided into military and civil aviation which is the fastest-growing aviation market in the world ( IATA data). [3] India's waterways network , in the form of rivers , canals , backwaters and creeks , is the ninth largest waterway network in the world. Freight transport by waterways is highly under utilised in India with the total cargo moved (in tonne kilometres) by inland waterways being 0.1 percent of the total inland traffic in India. [4] In total, about 21 percent of households have two wheelers whereas 4.70 percent of households in India have cars or vans as per the 2011 census of India . [5] [6] The automobile industry in India is currently growing rapidly with an annual production of over 4.6 million vehicles, [7] with an annual growth rate of 10.5% [5] and vehicle volume is expected to rise greatly in the future. [8]
Traditional means of transport
[ edit ]
Walking was a major transport form in ancient times. People used to cover long distances on foot or bull carts. For instance, Adi Sankaracharya travelled all over India from Kalady near Kochi . [9] Walking still constitutes an important mode of transport in rural areas. [10] In the city of Mumbai , to further improve the transit conditions for pedestrians , the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority , has commenced the construction of more than 50 skywalks , [11] [12] as part of the Mumbai Skywalk project, which is very helpful as walk enthusiasts take part in reducing traffic. The Dakshineswar Skywalk has also come up in West Bengal.
Palanquins

Royal Palanquin of Mehrangarh Fort
Palanquins , also known as palkis, were one of the luxurious methods used by the rich and noblemen for travelling and also to carry a deity (idol) of a god. Many temples have sculptures of a god being carried in palkis. [13] Modern use of the palanquin is limited to Indian weddings , pilgrimage and carrying idols of gods. [14] [15]
Bullock carts
[ edit ]
A bullock cart
Bullock carts used to be a way of transportation in India, but it is seldom seen today due to the slow speed and advent of motorised vehicles. It is still prevalent in deep within the rural areas for the transport of goods.
Bicycles
Main article: Cycling in India
Bicycles or cycles, have ownership rates ranging from around 30% to 75% at the state level. [6] Along with walking, cycling accounts for 50% to 80% of the commuter trips for those in the informal sector in urban areas. [10] However, recent developments suggest that bicycle riding is quickly becoming popular in Indian cities. In smaller Indian cities, non-motorized transport, which includes cycling, accounts for close to 50% of the total trips by the working-class population. In larger cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi, non-motorized transport accounts for 35%-37% of the total trips. [16] In recent years, government development authorities all over India encourages the setup and use of separate bicycle lanes alongside the roads to combat pollution and ease traffic congestion. [17]
Human-rickshaws
[ edit ]
Human-pulled rickshaws still run in Kolkata
Human-pulled rickshaws are nowadays rarely available in various cities and villages in the country. Many local governments have proposed a ban on these rickshaws describing them as ""inhuman"". The Government of West Bengal proposed a ban on these rickshaws in 2005. [18] Though a bill aiming to address this issue, termed as Calcutta Hackney Carriage Bill, was passed by the West Bengal Assembly in 2006, it has not yet been implemented. [19] The Government of West Bengal is working on an amendment to this bill to avoid the loopholes that were exposed when the Hand-pulled Rickshaw Owners' Association filed a petition against the bill. [19]
Cycle rickshaw
[ edit ]
Cycle rickshaws were introduced in India in the 1940s. [20] They are bigger than a tricycle where two people sit on an elevated seat at the back and a person pedals from the front. In the late 2000s, they were banned in several cities for causing traffic congestion. [21] [22] [23] The Delhi Police recently submitted an affidavit against plying of cycle rickshaws to ease traffic congestion in the city but it was dismissed by the Delhi High Court . [24] In addition, environmentalists have supported the retention of cycle rickshaws as a non-polluting mode of transport. [25]

As per 2024 estimates, the total road length in India is 6,700,000 km (4,200,000 mi); making the Indian road network the second largest road network in the world after the United States. At 0.66 km of highway per square kilometre of land the density of India's highway network is higher than that of the United States (0.65) and far higher than that of China's (0.16) or Brazil's (0.20). [1]
India has a network of National Highways connecting all the major cities and state capitals, forming the economic backbone of the country. As of 2013, India has a total of 161,350 km (100,258 mi) of National Highways, of which 5,930 km (3,685 mi) are classified as expressways . [26] Although India has large network of four or more lane highways of international quality standards, but without access control (entry/exit control), they are not called as expressways but simply highways.
As per the National Highways Authority of India , about 66% of freight and 82% passenger traffic is carried by the roads. The National Highways carry about 40% of total road traffic, though only about 2% of the road network is covered by these roads. [26] Average growth of the number of vehicles has been around 10.16% per annum over recent years. [26]
India also has many bridges and flyovers in major cities to reduce traffic congestion. Some notable projects include Bandra - Worli Sea link in Mumbai and Kathipara Cloverleaf Interchange in Chennai. India's metropolitan intra-city average traffic vehicle speed in Delhi was 25 km/h (16 mph), in Mumbai 20.7 km/h (12.9 mph), in Chennai 18.9 km/h (11.7 mph) and in Kolkata 19.2 km/h (11.9 mph), as per a study by Ola Cabs in 2017.
Under National Highways Development Project (NHDP), work is under progress to equip national highways with at least four lanes; there is also a plan to convert some stretches of these roads to six lanes. [27] In recent years construction has commenced on a nationwide system of multi-lane highways, including the Golden Quadrilateral connecting four important metropolitan cities of India ( Delhi - Kolkata - Chennai - Mumbai ) and North-South and East-West Corridors which link the largest cities in India .
In 2000, around 40% of villages in India lacked access to all-weather roads and remained isolated during the monsoon season. [1] [28] To improve rural connectivity, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (Prime Minister's Rural Road Program), a project funded by the Central Government with the help of the World Bank , was launched in 2000 to build all-weather roads to connect all habitations with a population of 500 or above (250 or above for hilly areas). [28] [29]

The Trans Harbour bridge is the longest sea bridge in India. It was inaugurated on 12 January 2024, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It connects Mumbai with Navi Mumbai. [30] [31]
Bus
[ edit ]
Mumbai's B.E.S.T. is India's oldest operating transport body
Buses are an important means of public transport in India. Due to this social significance, urban bus transport is often owned and operated by public agencies, and most state governments operate bus services through a state road transport corporation. [32] These corporations have proven extremely useful in connecting villages and towns across the country. [33] Alongside the public companies there are many private bus fleets: As of 2012, there were 131,800 publicly owned buses in India, but 1,544,700 buses owned by private companies. [34]
However, the share of buses is negligible in most Indian cities as compared to personalised vehicles, and two-wheelers and cars account for more than 80 percent of the vehicle population in most large cities. [33]
Bus rapid transit systems
Raipur and Naya Raipur Bus Rapid Transit System
A KSRTC Volvo bus. Such buses are common across the country.
Bus rapid transit systems (BRTS), exist in several cities. [35] Buses take up over 90% of public transport in Indian cities, [36] and serve as an important mode of transport . Services are mostly run by state government owned transport corporations. [33] In 1990s, all government state transport corporations have introduced various facilities like low-floor buses for the disabled and air-conditioned buses to attract private car owners to help decongest roads. [37] [38]
In 2010, the Ahmedabad Bus Rapid Transit System won the prestigious Sustainable Transport Award from the Transportation Research Board in Washington. [39] Rainbow BRTS in Pune is the first BRTS system in the country. Mumbai introduced air conditioned buses in 1998. [40] Bangalore was the first city in India to introduce Volvo B7RLE intra-city buses in India in January 2005. [41] [42] [43] Bangalore is the first Indian city to have an air-conditioned bus stop, located near Cubbon Park . It was built by Airtel . [44] The city of Chennai houses one of Asia's largest bus terminus , the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus . [45]
Motor vehicles
[ edit ]
Motorised two-wheeler vehicles like scooters , motorcycles and mopeds are very popular due to their fuel efficiency and ease of use in congested roads or streets. The number of two-wheelers sold is several times to that of cars. There were 47.5 million powered two-wheelers in India in 2003 compared with just 8.6 million cars. [46]
Manufacture of motorcycles in India started when Royal Enfield began assembly in its plant in Chennai in 1948. Royal Enfield, an iconic brand name in the country, manufactures different variants of the British Bullet motorcycle which is a classic motorcycle that is still in production. [47] Hero MotoCorp (formerly Hero Honda), Honda , Bajaj Auto , Yamaha , TVS Motors and Mahindra 2 Wheelers are the largest two-wheeler companies in terms of market-share. [48]
Manufacture of scooters in India started when Automobile Products of India (API) set up at Mumbai and incorporated in 1949. They began assembling Innocenti -built Lambretta scooters in India. [49] They eventually acquired a licence for the Li150 series model, of which they began full-fledged production from the early 1960s onwards.[ citation needed ] In 1972, Scooters India Limited (SIL), a state-run enterprise based in Lucknow , Uttar Pradesh, bought the entire manufacturing rights of the last Innocenti Lambretta model. API has infrastructural facilities at Mumbai, Aurangabad , and Chennai , but has been non-operational since 2002. [ citation needed ] SIL stopped producing scooters in 1998.[ citation needed ]
Motorcycles and scooters can be rented in many cities, Wicked Ride, Metro Bikes and many other companies are working with state governments to solve last-mile connectivity problems with mass-transit. [50] Wearing protective headgear is mandatory for both the rider and the pillion-rider in most cities. [51]
Automobiles
[ edit ]
Private automobiles account for 30% of the total transport demand in urban areas of India. An average of 963 new private vehicles are registered every day in Delhi alone. [52] The number of automobiles produced in India rose from 6.3 million in 2002–2003 to 11 million (11.2 million) in 2008–2009. [53] There is substantial variation among cities and states in terms of dependence on private cars: Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi and Kolkata have 185, 127, 157 and 140 cars per 1,000 people respectively, which is much lower compared to developed countries. [54] This reflects different levels of urban density and varied qualities of public transport infrastructure. Nationwide, India still has a very low rate of car ownership. When comparing car ownership between BRICS developing countries, it is on a par with China, [55] and exceeded by Brazil and Russia. [55]
Hyundai's manufacturing plant at Sriperumbudur , Chennai , Tamil Nadu
Compact cars , especially hatchbacks predominate due to affordability, fuel efficiency, congestion, and lack of parking space in most cities. Chennai is known as the ""Detroit of India"" for its automobile industry. [56]
Maruti , Hyundai , Mahindra and Tata Motors are the most popular brands in the order of their market share. The Ambassador once had a monopoly, but is now an icon of pre- liberalisation India, and is still used by taxi companies. The Maruti 800 launched in 1984, created the first revolution in the Indian auto sector because of its low price and high quality. It had the highest market share until 2004, when it was overtaken by other low-cost models from Maruti such as the Alto and the Wagon R, the Indica from Tata Motors and the Santro from Hyundai . Over the 20 years since its introduction, about 2.4 million Maruti 800s have been sold. [57] However, with the launch of the Tata Nano , the least expensive production car in the world, the Maruti 800 lost its popularity. [58] [ citation needed ] India is also known for a variety of indigenous vehicles made in villages out of simple motors and vehicle spare parts. A few of these innovations are the jugaad , maruta, chhakda, and the peter rehra . [59]
In the city of Bangalore , Radio One and the Bangalore Traffic Police, launched a carpooling drive which has involved celebrities such as Robin Uthappa , and Rahul Dravid encouraging the public to carpool. [60] [61] [62] The initiative got a good response, and by the end of May 2009, 10,000 people are said to have carpooled in the city. [63] There have been efforts to improve the energy efficiency of transport systems in Indian cities, including by introducing performance standards for private automobiles or by banning particularly polluting older cars. The city of Kolkata, for example, passed a law in 2009/10 phasing out vehicles over 15 years old with the purpose of reducing air pollution. [64] However, the effects were mixed. On the one hand, poorer urban residents are more likely to see public health improvements from better air quality, since they are more likely to live in polluted areas and work outdoors than richer urban residents. [65] On the other hand, drivers of such vehicles suffered from losing their livelihoods as a result of this environmental regulation. [66]
Utility vehicles
[ edit ]
The first utility vehicle in India was manufactured by Mahindra . It was a copy of the original Jeep and was manufactured under licence. [67] The vehicle was an instant hit and made Mahindra one of the top companies in India. The Indian Army and police extensively use Mahindra vehicles along with Maruti Gypsys for transporting personnel and equipment. Tata Motors , the automobile manufacturing arm of the Tata Group , launched its first utility vehicle, the Tata Sumo , in 1994. [68] [69] The Sumo, owing to its then-modern design, captured a 31% share of the market within two years. [70] The Tempo Trax from Force Motors until recently was ruling the rural areas. Sports utility vehicles now form a sizeable part of the passenger vehicle market. [71] Models from Tata, Honda, Hyundai, Toyota and other brands are available. [72]

Charminar
1591 (434 years ago) (1591)
Location
granite , limestone , mortar and pulverized marble
The Charminar ( lit. 'four minarets ') is a monument located in Hyderabad , Telangana , India . Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana . [3] The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr , [4] as it is adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid .
The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi River . [5] To the west lies the Laad Bazaar , and to the southwest the richly ornamented Makkah Masjid. [6] It is listed as an archaeological and architectural treasure on the official list of monuments prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India . [7] The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words chār and minar, translating to ""Four Pillars""; the towers are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches. [6]
History
Charminar, Char Kaman and Gulzar Houz , photographed by Lala Deen Dayal in the 1880s
The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the current caretaker of the structure, mentions in its records, ""There are various theories regarding the purpose for which Charminar was constructed. However, it is widely accepted that Charminar was built at the centre of the city, to commemorate the eradication of plague"", a deadly disease which was widespread at that time. [8] [9] According to Jean de Thévenot , a French traveller of the 17th century whose narration was complemented with the available Persian texts, the Charminar was constructed in the year 1591 CE, to commemorate the beginning of the second Islamic millennium year (1000 AH ). The event was celebrated far and wide in the Islamic world , thus Qutb Shah founded the city of Hyderabad to celebrate the event and commemorate it with the construction of this building. [10] [11] : 17–19
The construction began in 1589 and was completed in two years at a cost of  Rs. 9 lakhs, which was around 2 lakh huns/gold coins in those times. It is said to weigh around 14000 tonnes with a minimum of 30 feet deep foundation. In 1670, a minaret had fallen after being struck by lightning. It was then repaired at a cost of around Rs. 58000. In 1820, some part of it was renovated by Sikandar Jah at a cost of Rs. 2 lakh.
The Charminar was constructed at the intersection of the historical trade route that connects the city to international markets through the port city of Machilipatnam. [12] : 195 The Old City of Hyderabad was designed with Charminar as its centrepiece. [13] The city was spread around the Charminar in four different quadrants and chambers, segregated according to the established settlements. Towards the north of Charminar is the Char Kaman , or four gateways, constructed in the cardinal direction. [10] [12] [14] [15] : 170 Additional eminent architects from Persia were also invited to develop the city plan. The structure itself was intended to serve as a mosque and madrasa . It is of Indo-Islamic architecture style, incorporating Persian architectural elements. A sample of Charminar is said to have been created at Dabirpura/Nagaboli graveyard before the actual construction.
Qutb Shah was also among the early poets of Dakhani Urdu . While laying the foundation of Charminar, he performed the prayers in Dakhini couplets, which are recorded as follows: [16] : 4 [17]
Dakhini Urdu میرا شہر لوگوں سے مامور کر راكهيو جوتو دريا میں مچھلی جيسے
Translation into Telugu
నదిలో చేపలని ఎలా నింపావో
ఈ నగరాన్ని కూడా అలా నింపు దేవుడా [16] : 4 [17]

Fill this city of mine with people as,
You filled the river with fishes O Lord. [16] : 4 [17]

Charminar was later captured and became an icon of Mughal Empire , the Asaf Jah I was the custodian of the famous structure.
80,000 Sepoy units loyal to the Mughal Empire lived within the ""garrison of the Charminar"" and often viewed it as a sister of the Taj Mahal [ citation needed ].

Charminar - May 2023
The Charminar masjid is a square structure with each side being 20 metres (66 ft) long. Each of the four sides has one of four grand arches, each facing a fundamental point that opens directly onto the street in front of it. At each corner stands an exquisitely shaped 56 metres (184 ft) high minaret, with a double balcony. Each minaret is crowned by a bulbous dome with dainty, petal-like designs at the base. Unlike the minarets of Taj Mahal , Charminar's four fluted minarets are built into the main structure. There are 149 winding steps to reach the upper floor. The structure is also known for its profusion of stucco decorations and the arrangement of balustrades and balconies. [18]
The structure is made of granite, limestone, mortar, and pulverised marble, weighing approximately 14,000 tones apiece. [19] Initially the monument was so proportionately planned that when the fort first opened, one could see all four corners of the bustling city of Hyderabad through each of its four grand arches, as each arch faced one of the most active royal ancestral streets.
A mosque is located at the western end of the open roof. The remaining section of the roof served as a royal court during the Qutb Shahi times. The actual mosque occupies the top floor of the four-storey structure. A vault which appears from inside like a dome supports two galleries within the Charminar, one over another. Above those is a terrace that serves as a roof that is bordered with a stone balcony. The main gallery has 45 covered prayer spaces with a large open space in front to accommodate more people for Friday prayers.
The clock on the four cardinal directions was added in 1889. There is a vazu (water cistern) in the middle with a small fountain for ablution before offering prayer in the Charminar mosque. [20]
Surrounding area

The area surrounding Charminar is also known by the same name. It falls under the Charminar constituency .
Makkah Masjid
Main article: Makkah Masjid, Hyderabad
The monument overlooks another grand mosque called the Makkah Masjid . Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the 5th ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, commissioned bricks to be made from the soil brought from Mecca , the holiest site of Islam , and used them in the construction of the central arch of the mosque, hence its name.
Bazaars

A market named Laad Bazaar is around Charminar. It is known for its jewelry, especially bangles. The nearby Pathargatti boulevard is also an important business street known for its pearls. In its heyday, the Charminar market had some 14,000 shops. The Bazaars surrounding Charminar were described in the poem "" In the Bazaars of Hyderabad "" by Sarojini Naidu .

Char Kaman seen from the top of the Charminar
Arches in four directions of Charminar are known as Char Kaman . These were built along with the Charminar in the 16th century. These are the Kali Kaman, Machli Kaman, Seher-e-Batil ki Kaman and Charminar Kaman. At the centre of these arches is a fountain called the Gulzar Houz . The Char Kaman are in dire need of restoration, and protection from encroachments. [21] [22]
Influences
[ edit ]
In 2007, Hyderabadi Muslims living in Pakistan constructed a small-scaled quasi replica of the Charminar at the main crossing of the Bahadurabad neighbourhood in Karachi . [23]
Lindt chocolatier Adelbert Boucher created a scaled model of the Charminar out of 50 kilograms of chocolate. The model, which required three days' labour, was on display at The Westin , Hyderabad, India on 25 and 26 September 2010. [24]
The Charminar Express is an express train named after the Charminar, which runs between Hyderabad and Chennai .

Chartres Cathedral , also known as the Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres, is a Catholic cathedral in Chartres , France, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) southwest of Paris . It is the seat of the bishop of Chartres . Mostly constructed between 1194 and 1220, it stands on the site of at least five cathedrals that have occupied the site since the Diocese of Chartres was formed as an episcopal see in the 4th century. It is one of the best-known and most influential examples of High Gothic and Classic Gothic architecture. Chartres Cathedral is known for its stained glass , and contains 167 stained-glass windows dating from the 12th century to the 20th century. This photograph shows the stained glass in the north transept of Chartres Cathedral. The rose window , which is 10.5 metres (34 feet) in diameter, was installed circa 1230 and contains imagery relating to the Virgin Mary and figures from the Old Testament . The presence of the coats of arms of King Louis IX and his mother Blanche of Castile are taken as a sign of royal patronage for this window. Below the rose are five lancet windows , each 7.5 metres (25 feet) tall, depicting Saint Anne and four Old Testament figures.

Help:CS1 errors - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#generic_name,"|translator=, |translator-last=, |translator-last= + |translator-first=
† Parameters checked for this error may also have the enumerated forms: |author-linkn= or |authorn-link= etc.
This error occurs when any of these |<param>-link= parameters contain a wikilink or a URL, or they contain any of the characters not permitted in Wikipedia article titles per WP:TITLESPECIALCHARACTERS (except _ (underscore), used as a replacement for spaces, and #, used as a fragment identifier when linking to article sections).  The prohibited characters are: < > [ ] | { }.
The |<param>-link= parameter value should contain only the title of a Wikipedia article or a link to a section of a Wikipedia article. Module:Citation/CS1 checks the |<param>-link= parameter values for wikimarkup and for a URI scheme (http://, https://, the protocol relative scheme //, etc.).  Interlanguage links in any of the |<param>-link= parameters require a leading colon:
:fr:Période d'exil de Caravage
While primarily intended to catch the errors mentioned above, Module:Citation/CS1 will also catch malformed interlanguage wikilinks wherever they occur.  Interlanguage wikilinks that have the form:
[[fr:Période d'exil de Caravage]]
do not create visible clickable links in the article text.  Instead, these links appear in the left pane in the languages list.  Module:Citation/CS1 disables interlanguage links in this form and emits an error message.  The correct form is:
[[:fr:Période d'exil de Caravage]]
This error can also be caused when:
there is a |<param>-link= value and the matching |<param>= parameter contains a wikilink.
|first= and |<param>-first= (and enumerated forms) contain a wikilink
To resolve this error, do one of the following:
Ensure that the |<param>-link= value is the full name of a Wikipedia article (without brackets) or a section of an article, and not a link to an external web site.
Make sure that there are no wikilinks in the matching |<param>= parameters.
If you want to link to a URL outside of Wikipedia, move the link to |url= or a similar parameter, if one is available in the template you are using.
Pages with this error are automatically placed in Category:CS1 errors: parameter link (5 pages). [a]
Check |pmc= value
Help desk
Check |pmc= value
The |pmc= parameter is for the PubMed Central identifier. PMCs are sequential numbers beginning at 1 and counting up. Module:Citation/CS1 checks the PMC identifier to make sure that the value is a number greater than zero and less than 11900000 and that the identifier contains only digits. Further validation is not performed.
To resolve this error, ensure that the |pmc= value is correct, and that there are no letters, punctuation, or other characters. Do not include ""PMC"" in the value.
If the value is correct and larger than the currently configured limit of 11900000, please report this at Help talk:Citation Style 1 , so that the limit can be updated.
Pages with this error are automatically placed in Category:CS1 errors: PMC (1 page). [a]
Check |pmid= value
Help desk
Check |pmid= value
The |pmid= parameter is for the PubMed identifier . PMIDs are checked to ensure that the identifier is a simple number without punctuation or spaces with a value between 1 and 39900000. Further validation is not performed.
To resolve this error, ensure that the |pmid= value is correct. If you find something that looks like a PMID and begins with ""PMC"", use |pmc= instead of |pmid=.
If the value is correct and larger than the currently configured limit of 39900000, please report this at Help talk:Citation Style 1 , so that the limit can be updated.
Pages with this error are automatically placed in Category:CS1 errors: PMID (1 page). [a]
Check |rfc= value

Check |rfc= value
The |rfc= parameter is for the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC identifier (unrelated to Wikipedia's internal RfCs). IETF RFCs are checked to ensure that the identifier is a simple number without punctuation or spaces with a value between 1 and 9300. Further validation is not performed.
To resolve this error, ensure that the |rfc= value is correct.
If the value is correct and larger than the currently configured limit of 9300, please report this at Help talk:Citation Style 1 , so that the limit can be updated.
Pages with this error are automatically placed in Category:CS1 errors: RFC (0 pages). [a]
Check |sbn= value
Help desk
Check |sbn= value: <type>
Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates that contain |sbn= are checked to ensure that the SBN is the proper length (nine digits), that the SBN uses the correct optional separators (simple space or hyphen), and that the final check digit is correct according to the SBN specification. Only one SBN is allowed in this field because the whole |sbn= value is included in the citation's COinS metadata . See also Wikipedia:COinS . More than one SBN, or characters that are not part of the SBN, corrupt the COinS metadata and may also corrupt the link to Special:BookSources .
The error message <type> indicator can be:
length – SBN is not 9 digits
checksum – SBN has one or more incorrect digits; look for typos and transposition
invalid character – SBN has one or more 'digits' that is not in the allowed set
invalid form – mis-positioned 'X' check digit
To resolve this error, ensure that the |sbn= value is correct, that only one SBN is used, that the proper optional separators are used, and that no other text is included. If the check digit is a lowercase 'x', change it to an uppercase 'X'.
Do not try to resolve the error by simply recalculating the check digit.  The check digit is there to check whether the main part of the number is correct.  If the SBN is failing to validate, it is likely that there is a typo in the main part of the number.  In this case, recalculating the check digit results in an apparently valid ISBN that leads to the wrong source (or to nowhere).
If the SBN as printed in your source is refusing to validate, do check both the front matter and the book cover for SBNs.  It is not uncommon for the SBN to be misprinted in the front matter but correct on the cover.
Do preview your edit and check that the new SBN does now link to the correct source.
In very rare cases, publishers have released books with malformed SBNs. If you are certain that a non-conforming SBN truly corresponds to the published work, then you can add accept-this-as-written markup around the identifier to suppress the error message. In many cases, books may have been reissued with a corrected SBN. Use a corrected SBN when possible.

Check |url= value
Check |url= value
Check |archive-url= value
External links in Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates are made from two parts: the title (|title=, |chapter=, etc.) and the URL (|url=, |archive-url=, |chapter-url=, etc.). The |url= parameter and other URL parameters must begin with a supported URI scheme . The URI schemes http://, https://, and the protocol relative scheme // are most commonly used; irc://, ircs://, ftp://, news:, mailto: and gopher:// are also supported.
The URL scheme and host are checked to ensure that they contain only Latin characters, certain (required) punctuation, and do not contain spaces.  The URL may be protocol relative (begins with //).  If there are no spaces and the URL is not protocol relative, then the scheme must comply with RFC 3986. [7]
Some URL domains are written with non-Latin characters.  cs1|2 does not accept those kinds of URLs so they must be ' internationalized '.  Online tools are available to internationalize URLs that are written in non-Latin scripts:
""IDN Conversion Tool"" . Verisign.
Only enter the domain in the tool and not the full url.
Top- and second-level domain names are checked for proper form.  Generally, top-level domain names must be two or more letters; second-level domain names must be two or more letters, digits, or hyphens (first and last character must be a letter or digit). Single-letter second-level domains are supported for:
all cc TLDs (the country code is not validated)
certain letters of the .com TLD (q, x, z)
certain letters of the .net TLD (i, q)
certain other TLDs (.cash, .company, .foundation, .media, .org, .today)
Third- and subsequent-level domain names are not checked.  The path portion of the URL is not checked.
There is an additional test for |archive-url=.  The cs1|2 templates expect that |archive-url= will hold a unique URL for an archived snapshot of the source identified by |url= or |chapter-url= (or any of its aliases).  This error message is emitted when the value assigned to |archive-url= is the same as the matching title or chapter URL.
To resolve this error, ensure that:
|url= and other URL parameters contain valid URLs
URLs copy-pasted from elsewhere include the URI scheme
that the domain name uses only Latin characters

Check |zbl= value
Help desk
Check |zbl= value
When Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates contain |zbl=, a test is done to see if the Zbl identifier value looks like a properly defined value. The |zbl= identifier is checked to make sure that it has the form: nnnn.nnnnn where n is any digit 0–9. Up to three leading zeros in the first quartet may be omitted.  Further validation of the Zbl identifier is not performed.
To resolve this error, ensure that the |zbl= value is correct.

Cite has empty unknown parameters: |<param1>=, |<param2>=, ...
This error message highlights CS1|2 templates that hold empty parameters with names that are not known to a given CS1|2 template.  This error message is a companion to Unknown parameter |xxxx= ignored .
Empty positional parameters, which typically look like two adjacent pipes in a template, | |, or a pipe and then the end of the template, |}}, are identified as numbered parameters: |1=.  Similarly, a pipe followed by an HTML comment that encloses everything before the next pipe or closing brace, | <!--<param name/value pair>--> | will be identified as an empty numbered parameter. Parameters that have both a pipe and an equal sign but do not have a name are identified as empty-string parameters: |= or | = → |(empty string)=.  Various templates that wrap CS1|2 templates may cause this error when they use constructs like this: |{{#if:{{{2|}}}|title}}={{{2|}}}.  When {{{2|}}} does not have a value, the template creates |=.
To resolve this error:
correct the parameter name,
remove the parameter from the CS1|2 template, or
change the citation to use a more appropriate template (e.g. change {{ Cite document }} to {{ Cite web }})
Pages with this error are automatically placed in Category:CS1 errors: empty unknown parameters (5 pages). [a]

Possible cave entrances on Mars. The pits have been informally named (A) Dena, (B) Chloe, (C) Wendy, (D) Annie, (E) Abby (left) and Nikki, and (F) Jeanne.
As of 2007 [update] seven putative cave entrances have been identified in satellite imagery of the planet Mars , all so far located on the flanks of Arsia Mons . [53] A more recent photograph of one of the features shows sunlight illuminating a side wall, suggesting that it may simply be a vertical pit rather than an entrance to a larger underground space.

Marina Beach as seen from Light house
Chennai is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu . With its historic landmarks and buildings, long sandy beaches, cultural and art centers and parks, Chennai's tourism offers many potentially interesting locations to visitors. A notable tourist attraction in Chennai is in the neighbouring town of Mahabalipuram , with its ancient temples and rock carvings of the 7th century Pallava kingdom is an UNESCO World Heritage site .
Chennai was ranked 9th in travel guide Lonely Planet 's 2015 top 10 cities ranking. [1]
Tourist arrival statistics
Mahabalipuram Shore Temple is a major tourist attraction
Bharatanatyam dance
Chennai had been the most visited city in India by foreign tourists consecutively from 2010 [2] to 2012, [3] [4] overtaking New Delhi and Mumbai with visitors to heritage sites in Kanchipuram and Mahabalipuram and medical tourists making up the largest numbers.
In 2011, Chennai was ranked 41st in global top 100 city destination ranking, with 3,174,500 tourists, a 14 percent increase from 2010, [5] This is up from 2,059,900 tourists in 2009, when Chennai was the third most visited city in India by foreigners ranked after Delhi and Mumbai . [6] Tourists from United States, UK, Sri Lanka , Malaysia and Singapore had visited the city in 2007. [7] [ failed verification ] In 2012, Chennai served 3,535,200 foreign tourists ranking as 38th most visited city in the world and most visited city in India. [4]
In 2013, Delhi and Mumbai overtook Chennai in terms of number of foreign visitors due to their considerably higher growth rates. Chennai attracted 3,581,200 foreign tourists that year with a growth rate of only 1.1 percent over 2012. [8] Chennai continued to remain the third most visited city destination of India by foreigners in 2014 [9] and 2015 [10] with 3,857,900 and 4,243,700 tourists respectively. The city was 43rd most visited city in the world for year 2015 and recorded growth of 10 percent in arrivals over 2014. [10]
As of 2012 [update] , the city has 21 luxury hotels in the five-star category, with over 4,500 rooms in the inventory. [11] As of 2018, the collective luxury room inventory across four and five-star categories is around 7,000. [12] About 85 percent of the room demand in Chennai comes from business travellers. Demand in the CBD area comes mainly from BFSI and PSU companies, while the demand in the southern side of the city (Old Mahabalipuram Road) comes from IT / ITeS companies.

Environment of India
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean
The environment of India comprises some of the world's most biodiverse ecozones. The Deccan Traps , Gangetic Plains and the Himalayas are the major geographical features. The country faces different forms of pollution as its major environmental issue and is more vulnerable to the effects of climate change [1] being a developing nation . India has laws protecting the environment and is one of the countries that signed the Convention on Biological Diversity [2] (CBD) treaty. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and each particular state forest departments plan and implement environmental policies throughout the country.
Features
Main article: Wildlife of India
The Bengal tiger . India has the highest number of cat species in the world. [3]
India has some of the world's most biodiverse ecozones—desert, high mountains, highlands, tropical and temperate forests, swamplands, plains, grasslands, areas surrounding rivers and an island archipelago. It hosts three biodiversity hotspots : the Western Ghats , the Himalayas and the Indo-Burma region. These hotspots have numerous endemic species. [4]
In 2021, around 7,13,789km2 of land in the country was under forests and 92 percent of that belonged to the government. Only 22.7 percent was forested compared to the recommended 33 percent by the National Forest Policy Resolution (1952). Majority of it are broad-leaved deciduous trees which comprise one-sixth sal and one-tenth teak . Coniferous types are found in the northern high altitude regions and comprise pines , junipers and deodars . [5]
There are 350 species of mammals, 375 reptiles, 130 amphibians, 20,000 insects, 19000 fish [6] and 1200 species of birds in India. The Asiatic lion , Bengal tiger and leopard are the main predators; the country has the most species of cats than any other. [7] Elephants, the Indian Rhinoceros and eight species of deer are also found. [8]
There are over 17000 species of flowering plants in India, which account for six percent of the total plant species in the world. India comprises seven percent of world's flora. Wide range of climatic conditions in India gave rise to rich variety of flora. India covers more than 45,000 species of flora, out of which several are endemic to the region. India is divided into eight main floristic regions: North-Western Himalayas, Eastern Himalayas, Assam, Indus plain, Ganga plain, the Deccan, the Malabar and the Andamans. [9]
Geography
Main article: Geography of India
India lies on the Indian Plate , the northern portion of the Indo-Australian Plate , whose continental crust forms the Indian subcontinent . The country is situated north of the equator between 8°4' and 37°6' north latitude and 68°7' and 97°25' east longitude. It is the seventh-largest country in the world , with a total area of 3,287,263 square kilometres (1,269,219 sq mi). [10] India measures 3,214 km (1,997 mi) from north to south and 2,933 km (1,822 mi) from east to west. It has a land frontier of 15,200 km (9,445 mi) and a coastline of 7,517 km (4,671 mi).
The formation of the Himalayas (pictured) during the Early Eocene some 52 mya was a key factor in determining India's modern-day climate; global climate and ocean chemistry may have been impacted too. [11]
The Indian plate and Eurasia collided between 40 and 60 million years ago according to four observations, one being that there is no mammalian fossil record in India from around 50 million years ago. [12] On its way, the Indian plate passed over the Reunion hotspot which led to volcanic activity, thus forming the Deccan Traps . Its collision with the Eurasian plate led to the rise of the Himalayas and the continuous tectonic activity still makes it an earthquake prone area. The Gangetic plains were formed by the deposition of silt by the Ganga and its tributaries into the area between the Himalayas and the Vindhya range . [13] The rock formations can be divided into the Archaean, Proterozoic (Dharwar system), Cuddupah system, Vindhyan system, Gondwana system, The Deccan Traps, Tertiary system, Pleistocene period and recent formations. [14]
The climate comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography, making generalisations difficult. Given the size of India with the Himalayas, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, there is a great variation in temperature and precipitation distribution in the subcontinent. [15] Based on the Köppen system , where the mean monthly temperature, mean monthly rainfall and mean annual rainfall are considered, India hosts six major climatic subtypes, ranging from arid desert in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories. Many regions have starkly different microclimates . The Indian Meteorological Department divides the seasons into four: Winter (mid-December to mid-March), Summer (mid-March to May), Rainy (June to September), and Retreating Monsoon (October to mid-December). [15]
Issues
Air pollution in India is a major environmental issue. Shown above is the Taj Mahal blanketed by smog.
Pollution is one of the main environmental issues in India.
Water pollution is a major concern in the country . The major sources of water pollution are domestic, industrial, agricultural and shipping waste waters. [16] The largest source of water pollution in India is untreated sewage . Other sources of pollution include agricultural runoff and unregulated small scale industry. Most rivers, lakes and surface water are polluted.
Land pollution: The main causes of soil (or land) pollution is soil erosion , excessive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, accumulation of solid and liquid waste, forest fires, and water-logging. It can be reduced by judicious use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides and treatment of effluents before being used for irrigation. [17] Due to increasing population and enhanced food grains consumption, more and more rain fed crop lands are brought under intensive cultivation by ground and surface water irrigation. The irrigated land is losing gradually its fertility by converting into saline alkali soil.
Air pollution in the country is another concern. A major source is the matter released by the combustion of fossil fuels . Airborne particles like soot, fumes and dust are potentially harmful depending on the pollutant's chemical and physical structure. They can affect climate and reduce scattering of solar radiation in the atmosphere. [18]
Noise pollution : This can be defined as the state of discomfort or stress caused by unwanted high intensity sound. It increases in proportion to urbanisation and industrialisation. [17]
Circular Economy and Waste Management

India is on the path to adopting a circular economy techniques to face the increasing challenges of waste management in the growing nation. The country produces about 62 million tons of solid waste every year, out of which only 75% is collected and 20% processed. [19] In efforts to handle plastic waste, the government banned single-use plastics in 2022 [20] and set up EPR frameworks for e-waste [21] and packaging material management. Initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Mission gave a sudden increase to waste collection in metropolitan and city areas, but the practice of source segregation of material remains insufficient and there are problems in informal recycling systems.
Promising examples include Indore’s waste segregation and recycling programs, making it India’s cleanest city. [22] Corporates are adopting circular practices by recycling steel scrap, while rural areas engage in community composting. Waste-to-energy plants, though underutilized, offer potential solutions for non-recyclable waste. However, scaling these models requires improved infrastructure, public awareness, and greater investments in technology.
Climate change
Further information: Climate change in India and Effects of global warming on South Asia
Being a developing nation, India is more vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to its dependence on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture and forestry. [23] Low per capita incomes and small public budgets also lead to low financial adaptive capacity. [23] The nation is vulnerable to the immediate socio-economic effects of climate change. A 2002 study indicated that the temperature over the country increased at around 0.57° per 100 years. [23]
Inadequate infrastructure also means that people are more exposed, and less resilient, to climate change. For example, as of 2015, only 124 million Indians were connected to a sewer and 297 million to a septic tank. [24] The remainder depend on pit latrines or open defecation, which creates major risks of waterborne disease during floods - which will become more frequent and severe with climate change. These risks are more severe in urban areas, where the higher density of people means that basic infrastructure options might not be adequate. Additionally, many Indian megacities are in floodplains and deltas, and will therefore be very exposed to climate hazards such as sea level rise, storm surges and cyclones. [25]
Although India still has low average incomes per person, the country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions after China and the USA. The central government has pledged to reduce the emission intensity of Gross Domestic Product by 20-25%, relative to 2005 levels, by 2020. India has also made major pledges to expand its renewable energy supply, enhance energy efficiency, build mass transit and other measures to reduce its emissions. [26] There is evidence that many of these climate actions could generate substantial benefits in addition to reducing India's carbon footprint. Many low-carbon measures are economically attractive, including more efficient air conditioners, parking demand management, gasification and vehicle performance standards. [27] Others offer social benefits: for example, Indian cities might see substantial improvements in air quality if the country were to promote renewable energy technologies instead of fossil fuels and walking/cycling/public transport instead of private vehicles.

Chartres Cathedral , also known as the Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres, is a Catholic cathedral in Chartres , France, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) southwest of Paris . It is the seat of the bishop of Chartres . Mostly constructed between 1194 and 1220, it stands on the site of at least five cathedrals that have occupied the site since the Diocese of Chartres was formed as an episcopal see in the 4th century. It is one of the best-known and most influential examples of High Gothic and Classic Gothic architecture. Chartres Cathedral is known for its stained glass , and contains 167 stained-glass windows dating from the 12th century to the 20th century. This photograph shows the stained glass in the north transept of Chartres Cathedral. The rose window , which is 10.5 metres (34 feet) in diameter, was installed circa 1230 and contains imagery relating to the Virgin Mary and figures from the Old Testament . The presence of the coats of arms of King Louis IX and his mother Blanche of Castile are taken as a sign of royal patronage for this window. Below the rose are five lancet windows , each 7.5 metres (25 feet) tall, depicting Saint Anne and four Old Testament figures.

This article is about the general overview of Indian languages. For historical context, see Linguistic history of India .
Not to be confused with Languages of the Indian subcontinent .
Languages of India
Languages of India belong to several language families , the major ones being the Indo-Aryan languages spoken by 78.05% of Indians and the Dravidian languages spoken by 19.64% of Indians; [5] [6] both families together are sometimes known as Indic languages . [7] [8] [9] [a] Languages spoken by the remaining 2.31% of the population belong to the Austroasiatic , Sino–Tibetan , Tai–Kadai , and a few other minor language families and isolates . [10] : 283 According to the People's Linguistic Survey of India , India has the second highest number of languages (780), after Papua New Guinea ( 840 ). [11] Ethnologue lists a lower number of 456. [12]
Article 343 of the Constitution of India stated that the official language of the Union is Hindi in Devanagari script, with official use of English to continue for 15 years from 1947. In 1963, a constitutional amendment, The Official Languages Act , allowed for the continuation of English alongside Hindi in the Indian government indefinitely until legislation decides to change it. [2] The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union are ""the international form of Indian numerals "", [13] [14] which are referred to as Arabic numerals in most English-speaking countries. [1] Despite some misconceptions, Hindi is not the national language of India; the Constitution of India does not give any language the status of national language. [15] [16]
The Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists 22 languages, [17] which have been referred to as scheduled languages and given recognition, status and official encouragement. In addition, the Government of India has awarded the distinction of classical language to Kannada , Malayalam , Odia , Sanskrit , Marathi , Tamil and Telugu . This status is given to languages that have a rich heritage and independent nature.[ citation needed ]
According to the Census of India of 2001 , India has 122 major languages and 1599 other languages. However, figures from other sources vary, primarily due to differences in the definition of the terms ""language"" and ""dialect"". The 2001 Census recorded 30 languages which were spoken by more than a million native speakers and 122 which were spoken by more than 10,000 people. [18] Three contact languages have played an important role in the history of India in chronological order: Sanskrit , [19] Persian [20] and English. [21] Persian was the court language during the Indo-Muslim period in India and reigned as an administrative language for several centuries until the era of British colonisation . [22] English continues to be an important language in India. It is used in higher education and in some areas of the Indian government.[ citation needed ]
Hindi , which has the largest number of first-language speakers in India today, [23] serves as the lingua franca across much of northern and central India . However, there have been concerns raised with Hindi being imposed in South India , most notably in the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka . [24] [25] Some in Maharashtra , West Bengal , Assam , Punjab and other non-Hindi regions have also started to voice concerns about imposition of Hindi. [26] Bengali is the second most spoken and understood language in the country with a significant number of speakers in eastern and northeastern regions . Marathi is the third most spoken and understood language in the country with a significant number of speakers in the southwest, [27] followed closely by Telugu, which is most commonly spoken in southeastern areas. [28]
Hindi is the fastest growing language of India, followed by Kashmiri in the second place, with Meitei (officially called Manipuri ) as well as Gujarati , in the third place, and Bengali in the fourth place, according to the 2011 census of India . [29]
According to the Ethnologue , India has 148 Sino-Tibetan , 140 Indo-European , 84 Dravidian , 32 Austro-Asiatic , 14 Andamanese , 5 Kra-Dai languages. [30]
History
Further information: Persian language in the Indian subcontinent
The Southern Indian languages are from the Dravidian family . The Dravidian languages are indigenous to the Indian subcontinent. [31] Proto-Dravidian languages were spoken in India in the 4th millennium BCE and started disintegrating into various branches around 3rd millennium BCE. [32] The Dravidian languages are classified in four groups: North, Central (Kolami–Parji), South-Central (Telugu–Kui), and South Dravidian (Tamil-Kannada). [33]
The Northern Indian languages from the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European family evolved from Old Indo-Aryan by way of the Middle Indo-Aryan Prakrit languages and Apabhraṃśa of the Middle Ages . The Indo-Aryan languages developed and emerged in three stages — Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE to 600 BCE), Middle Indo-Aryan stage (600 BCE and 1000 CE), and New Indo-Aryan (between 1000 CE and 1300 CE). The modern north Indian Indo-Aryan languages all evolved into distinct, recognisable languages in the New Indo-Aryan Age. [34]
In the Northeast India , among the Sino-Tibetan languages , Meitei language (officially known as Manipuri language ) was the court language of the Manipur Kingdom ( Meitei : Meeteileipak). It was honoured before and during the darbar sessions before Manipur was merged into the Dominion of the Indian Republic. Its history of existence spans from 1500 to 2000 years according to most eminent scholars including Padma Vibhushan awardee Suniti Kumar Chatterji . [35] [36] Even according to the ""Manipur State Constitution Act, 1947"" of the once independent Manipur, Manipuri and English were made the court languages of the kingdom (before merging into Indian Republic). [37] [38]
Persian , or Farsi, was brought into India by the Ghaznavids and other Turko-Afghan dynasties as the court language. Culturally Persianized, they, in combination with the later Mughal dynasty (of Turco-Mongol origin), influenced the art, history, and literature of the region for more than 500 years, resulting in the Persianisation of many Indian tongues, mainly lexically. In 1837, the British replaced Persian with English and Hindustani in Perso-Arabic script for administrative purposes and the Hindi movement of the 19th Century replaced Persianised vocabulary with Sanskrit derivations and replaced or supplemented the use of Perso-Arabic script for administrative purposes with Devanagari. [20] [39]
Each of the northern Indian languages had different influences. For example, Hindustani was strongly influenced by Sanskrit , Arabic and Persian , leading to the emergence of Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu as registers of the Hindustani language. Bangla on the other hand has retained its Sanskritic roots while heavily expanding its vocabulary with words from Persian, English, French and other foreign languages. [40] [41]
Inventories
Main article: List of languages by number of native speakers in India
The first official survey of language diversity in the Indian subcontinent was carried out by Sir George Abraham Grierson from 1898 to 1928. Titled the Linguistic Survey of India , it reported a total of 179 languages and 544 dialects. [42] However, the results were skewed due to ambiguities in distinguishing between ""dialect"" and ""language"", [42] use of untrained personnel and under-reporting of data from South India, as the former provinces of Burma and Madras, as well as the princely states of Cochin, Hyderabad, Mysore and Travancore were not included in the survey. [43]
Languages of India by language families ( Ethnologue ) [44]
Kra–Dai (1.17%)
Isolates (0.23%)
Different sources give widely differing figures, primarily based on how the terms ""language"" and ""dialect"" are defined and grouped. Ethnologue , produced by the Christian evangelist organisation SIL International , lists 435 tongues for India (out of 6,912 worldwide), 424 of which are living, while 11 are extinct. The 424 living languages are further subclassified in Ethnologue as follows: [44] [45]
Institutional– 45
Endangered– 131
Extinct– 11
The People's Linguistic Survey of India, a privately owned research institution in India, has recorded over 66 different scripts and more than 780 languages in India during its nationwide survey, which the organisation claims to be the biggest linguistic survey in India. [46]
The People of India (POI) project of Anthropological Survey of India reported 325 languages which are used for in-group communication by 5,633 Indian communities. [47]
Census of India figures
The Census of India records and publishes data with respect to the number of speakers for languages and dialects, but uses its own unique terminology, distinguishing between language and mother tongue. The mother tongues are grouped within each language. Many of the mother tongues so defined could be considered a language rather than a dialect by linguistic standards. This is especially so for many mother tongues with tens of millions of speakers that are officially grouped under the language Hindi.
1961 Census
The 1961 census recognised 1,652 mother tongues spoken by 438,936,918 people, counting all declarations made by any individual at the time when the census was conducted. [49] However, the declaring individuals often mixed names of languages with those of dialects, subdialects and dialect clusters or even castes, professions, religions, localities, regions, countries and nationalities. [49] The list therefore includes languages with barely a few individual speakers as well as 530 unclassified mother tongues and more than 100 idioms that are non-native to India, including linguistically unspecific demonyms such as ""African"", ""Canadian"" or ""Belgian"". [49]
1991 Census
The 1991 census recognises 1,576 classified mother tongues. [50] According to the 1991 census, 22 languages had more than a million native speakers, 50 had more than 100,000 and 114 had more than 10,000 native speakers. The remaining accounted for a total of 566,000 native speakers (out of a total of 838 million Indians in 1991). [50] [51]
2001 Census
According to the census of 2001, there are 1,635 rationalised mother tongues, 234 identifiable mother tongues and 22 major languages. [18] Of these, 29 languages have more than a million native speakers, 60 have more than 100,000 and 122 have more than 10,000 native speakers. [52] There are a few languages like Kodava that do not have a script but have a group of native speakers in Coorg (Kodagu). [53]
2011 Census
According to the most recent census of 2011, after thorough linguistic scrutiny, edit, and rationalization on 19,569 raw linguistic affiliations, the census recognizes 1,369 rationalized mother tongues and 1,474 names which were treated as ‘unclassified’ and relegated to ‘other’ mother tongue category. [54] Among, the 1,369 rationalized mother tongues which are spoken by 10,000 or more speakers, are further grouped into appropriate set that resulted into total 121 languages. In these 121 languages, 22 are already part of the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India and the other 99 are termed as ""Total of other languages"" which is one short as of the other languages recognized in 2001 census.

Language families
Ethnolinguistically, the languages of South Asia, echoing the complex history and geography of the region, form a complex patchwork of language families , language phyla and isolates . [10] Languages spoken in India belong to several language families , the major ones being the Indo-Aryan languages spoken by 78.05% of Indians and the Dravidian languages spoken by 19.64% of Indians. The most important language families in terms of speakers are: [59] [5] [6] [10] [60]

Present-day geographical distribution of the major Indo-Aryan language groups. Romani , Domari , Kholosi , Luwati , and Lomavren are outside the scope of the map.
(not shown: Kunar (Dardic), Chinali-Lahuli (Unclassified))
The largest of the language families represented in India, in terms of speakers, is the Indo-Aryan language family , a branch of the Indo-Iranian family , itself the easternmost, extant subfamily of the Indo-European language family . This language family predominates, accounting for some 1035 million speakers, or over 76.5 of the population, per a 2018 estimate. The most widely spoken languages of this group are Hindi , [n 1] Bengali , Marathi , Gujarati , Bhojpuri , Awadhi , Odia , Maithili , Punjabi , Marwari , Kashmiri , Assamese (Asamiya) , Chhattisgarhi and Sindhi . [62] [63] Aside from the Indo-Aryan languages, other Indo-European languages are also spoken in India, the most prominent of which is English, as a lingua franca .
Dravidian language family
Main article: Dravidian languages
The second largest language family is the Dravidian language family , accounting for some 277 million speakers, or approximately 20.5% per 2018 estimate. The Dravidian languages are spoken mainly in southern India and parts of eastern and central India as well as in parts of northeastern Sri Lanka , Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh . The Dravidian languages with the most speakers are Telugu , Tamil , Kannada and Malayalam . [6] Besides the mainstream population, Dravidian languages are also spoken by small scheduled tribe communities, such as the Oraon and Gond tribes. [64] Only two Dravidian languages are exclusively spoken outside India, Brahui in Balochistan, Pakistan and Dhangar , a dialect of Kurukh , in Nepal . [65]
Austroasiatic language family
Families with smaller numbers of speakers are Austroasiatic and numerous small Sino-Tibetan languages , with some 10 and 6 million speakers, respectively, together 3% of the population. [66]
The Austroasiatic language family (austro meaning South) is the autochthonous language in Southeast Asia, arrived by migration. Austroasiatic languages of mainland India are the Khasi and Munda languages , including Bhumij and Santali . The languages of the Nicobar islands also form part of this language family. With the exceptions of Khasi and Santali, all Austroasiatic languages on Indian territory are endangered. [10] : 456–457
Tibeto-Burman language family
The Tibeto-Burman language family is well represented in India. However, their interrelationships are not discernible, and the family has been described as ""a patch of leaves on the forest floor"" rather than with the conventional metaphor of a ""family tree"". [10] : 283–5
Padma Vibhushan awardee Indian Bengali scholar Suniti Kumar Chatterjee said, ""Among the various Tibeto-Burman languages, the most important and in literature certainly of much greater importance than Newari, is the Meitei or Manipuri language "". [67] [68] [69]
In India, Tibeto-Burman languages are spoken across the Himalayas in the regions of Arunachal Pradesh , Assam (hills and autonomous councils), Himachal Pradesh , Ladakh , Manipur , Meghalaya , Mizoram , Nagaland , Sikkim , Tripura and West Bengal . [70] [71] [72]
Sino-Tibetan languages spoken in India include two constitutionally recognised official languages, Meitei (officially known as Manipuri ) and Bodo as well as the non-scheduled languages like Karbi , Lepcha , and many varieties of several related Tibetic , West Himalayish , Tani , Brahmaputran , Angami–Pochuri , Tangkhul , Zeme , Kukish sub linguistic branches, amongst many others.
Tai-Kadai language family

)
The Ahom language , a Southwestern Tai language , had been once the dominant language of the Ahom Kingdom in modern-day Assam , but was later replaced by the Assamese language (known as Kamrupi in ancient era which is the pre-form of the Kamrupi dialect of today). Nowadays, small Tai communities and their languages remain in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh together with Sino-Tibetans, e.g. Tai Phake , Tai Aiton and Tai Khamti , which are similar to the Shan language of Shan State , Myanmar ; the Dai language of Yunnan , China ; the Lao language of Laos ; the Thai language of Thailand ; and the Zhuang language in Guangxi , China .
Andamanese language families
The languages of the Andaman Islands form another group: [73]
the Great Andamanese languages , comprising a number of extinct, and one highly endangered language Aka-Jeru .
the Ongan family of the southern Andaman Islands , comprising two extant languages, Önge and Jarawa , and one extinct language, Jangil .
In addition, Sentinelese is thought likely to be related to the above languages. [73]
Language isolates
The only language found in the Indian mainland that is considered a language isolate is Nihali . [10] : 337 The status of Nihali is ambiguous, having been considered as a distinct Austroasiatic language, as a dialect of Korku and also as being a ""thieves' argot"" rather than a legitimate language. [74] [75]
The other language isolates found in the rest of South Asia include Burushaski , a language spoken in Gilgit–Baltistan (administered by Pakistan), Kusunda (in western Nepal), and Vedda (in Sri Lanka). [10] : 283 The validity of the Great Andamanese language group as a language family has been questioned and it has been considered a language isolate by some authorities. [10] : 283 [76] [77] The Hruso language , which is long assumed to be a Sino-Tibetan language , it may actually be a language isolate . [78] [79] Roger Blench classifies the Shompen language of the Nicobar Islands as a language isolate. [80] Roger Blench also considers Puroik to be a language isolate . [81]
In addition, a Bantu language , Sidi , was spoken until the mid-20th century in Gujarat by the Siddi . [10] : 528

After Mughal rule and prior to Independence, in British India , English was the sole language used for administrative purposes as well as for higher education purposes. [85]
In 1946, the issue of national language was a bitterly contested subject in the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly of India , specifically what should be the language in which the Constitution of India is written and the language spoken during the proceedings of Parliament and thus deserving of the epithet ""national"".
The Constitution of India does not give any language the status of national language . [15] [16]
Members belonging to the northern parts of India insisted that the Constitution be drafted in Hindi with the unofficial translation in English. This was not agreed to by the drafting committee on the grounds that English was much better to craft the nuanced prose on constitutional subjects. The efforts to make Hindi the pre-eminent language were bitterly resisted by the members from those parts of India where Hindi was not spoken natively.
Eventually, a compromise was reached not to include any mention of a national language. Instead, Hindi in Devanagari script was declared to be the official language of the union, but for ""fifteen years from the commencement of the Constitution, the English Language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement."" [85]
Article 343 (1) of the Constitution of India states ""The Official Language of the Union government shall be Hindi in Devanagari script."" [86] : 212 [87] Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of English for official purposes was to cease 15 years after the constitution came into effect, i.e. on 26 January 1965. [86] : 212 [87]
As the date for changeover approached, however, there was much alarm in the non-Hindi-speaking areas of India, especially in Kerala , Gujarat , Maharashtra , Tamil Nadu , Punjab , West Bengal , Karnataka , Puducherry and Andhra Pradesh . Accordingly, Jawaharlal Nehru ensured the enactment of the Official Languages Act, 1963 , [88] [89] which provided that English ""may"" still be used with Hindi for official purposes, even after 1965. [85] The wording of the text proved unfortunate in that while Nehru understood that ""may"" meant shall, politicians championing the cause of Hindi thought it implied exactly the opposite. [85]
In the event, as 1965 approached, India's new Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri prepared to make Hindi paramount with effect from 26 January 1965. This led to widespread agitation, riots, self-immolations, and suicides in Tamil Nadu. The split of Congress politicians from the South from their party stance, the resignation of two Union ministers from the South, and the increasing threat to the country's unity forced Shastri to concede. [85] [25]
As a result, the proposal was dropped, [90] [91] and the Act itself was amended in 1967 to provide that the use of English would not be ended until a resolution to that effect was passed by the legislature of every state that had not adopted Hindi as its official language, and by each house of the Indian Parliament. [88]

The Hindi-belt, including Hindi-related languages such as Rajasthani and Bhojpuri
In the 2001 census , 422 million (422,048,642) people in India reported Hindi to be their native language. [92] This figure not only included Hindi speakers of Hindustani , but also people who identify as native speakers of related languages who consider their speech to be a dialect of Hindi, the Hindi belt . Hindi (or Hindustani) is the native language of most people living in Delhi and Western Uttar Pradesh . [93]
""Modern Standard Hindi"", a standardised language is one of the official languages of the Union of India . In addition, it is one of only two languages used for business in Parliament. However, the Rajya Sabha now allows all 22 official languages on the Eighth Schedule to be spoken. [94]
Hindustani, evolved from khari boli (खड़ी बोली), a prominent tongue of Mughal times , which itself evolved from Apabhraṃśa , an intermediary transition stage from Prakrit , from which the major North Indian Indo-Aryan languages have evolved.[ citation needed ]
By virtue of its being a lingua franca , Hindi has also developed regional dialects such as Bambaiya Hindi in Mumbai . In addition, a trade language, Andaman Creole Hindi has also developed in the Andaman Islands . [95] In addition, by use in popular culture such as songs and films, Hindi also serves as a lingua franca across North-Central India.[ citation needed ]
Hindi is widely taught both as a primary language and language of instruction and as a second tongue in many states.
English
Main articles: English language and Indian English
British colonialism in India resulted in English becoming a language for governance, business, and education. English, along with Hindi, is one of the two languages permitted in the Constitution of India for business in Parliament. Despite the fact that Hindi has official Government patronage and serves as a lingua franca over large parts of India, there was considerable opposition to the use of Hindi in the southern states of India, and English has emerged as a de facto lingua franca over much of India. [85] [25] Journalist Manu Joseph , in a 2011 article in The New York Times , wrote that due to the prominence and usage of the language and the desire for English-language education, ""English is the de facto national language of India. It is a bitter truth."" [96] English language proficiency is highest among urban residents, wealthier Indians, Indians with higher levels of educational attainment, Christians, men and younger Indians. [97] In 2017, more than 58 percent of rural teens could read basic English, and 53 percent of fourteen year-olds & sixty percent of 18-year-olds could read English sentences. [98]

Until the Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution of India in 1967, the country recognised 14 official regional languages. The Eighth Schedule and the Seventy-First Amendment provided for the inclusion of Sindhi , Konkani , Meitei and Nepali , thereby increasing the number of official regional languages of India to 18. The Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India, as of 1 December 2007, lists 22 languages, [86] : 330 which are given in the table below together with the regions where they are used. [92]

The individual states , the borders of most of which are or were drawn on socio-linguistic lines, can legislate their own official languages, depending on their linguistic demographics. The official languages chosen reflect the predominant as well as politically significant languages spoken in that state. Certain states having a linguistically defined territory may have only the predominant language in that state as its official language, examples being Karnataka and Gujarat , which have Kannada and Gujarati as their sole official language respectively. Telangana , with a sizeable Urdu-speaking Muslim population, and Andhra Pradesh [100] has two languages, Telugu and Urdu , as its official languages.
Some states buck the trend by using minority languages as official languages. Jammu and Kashmir used to have Urdu , which is spoken by fewer than 1% of the population, as the sole official language until 2020. Meghalaya uses English spoken by 0.01% of the population. This phenomenon has turned majority languages into ""minority languages"" in a functional sense. [101]
In addition to official languages, a few states also designate official scripts.

Prominent languages of India

At a tourist site in Bengaluru – Top to bottom, the languages are Hindi, Kannada , Tamil , Telugu , and Malayalam . English and many other European languages are also provided here.
In British India , English was the sole language used for administrative purposes as well as for higher education purposes. When India became independent in 1947, the Indian legislators had the challenge of choosing a language for official communication as well as for communication between different linguistic regions across India. The choices available were:
Making ""Hindi"" , which a plurality of the people (41%) [92] identified as their native language, the official language.
Making English, as preferred by non-Hindi speakers, particularly Kannadigas and Tamils , and those from Mizoram and Nagaland , the official language. See also Anti-Hindi agitations .
Declare both Hindi and English as official languages and each state is given freedom to choose the official language of the state.
The Indian constitution , in 1950, declared Hindi in Devanagari script to be the official language of the union. [86] Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of English for official purposes was to cease 15 years after the constitution came into effect, i.e. on 26 January 1965. [86] The prospect of the changeover, however, led to much alarm in the non-Hindi-speaking areas of India, especially in South India whose native tongues are not related to Hindi. As a result, Parliament enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 , [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] which provided for the continued use of English for official purposes along with Hindi, even after 1965.
Bengali
Main article: Bengali language
Native to the Bengal region, comprising the nation of Bangladesh and the states of West Bengal , Tripura and Barak Valley region [158] [159] of Assam . Bengali (also spelt as Bangla: বাংলা) is the sixth most spoken language in the world. [158] [159] After the partition of India (1947), refugees from East Pakistan were settled in Tripura , and Jharkhand and the union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands . There is also a large number of Bengali-speaking people in Maharashtra and Gujarat where they work as artisans in jewellery industries. Bengali developed from Abahattha , a derivative of Apabhramsha , itself derived from Magadhi Prakrit . The modern Bengali vocabulary contains the vocabulary base from Magadhi Prakrit and Pali , also borrowings from Sanskrit and other major borrowings from Persian , Arabic , Austroasiatic languages and other languages in contact with.
Like most Indian languages, Bengali has a number of dialects. It exhibits diglossia , with the literary and standard form differing greatly from the colloquial speech of the regions that identify with the language. [160] Bengali language has developed a rich cultural base spanning art, music, literature, and religion. Bengali has some of the oldest literature of all modern Indo-Aryan languages, dating from about 10th to 12th century (' Chargapada ' Buddhist songs). There have been many movements in defence of this language and in 1999 UNESCO declared 21 Feb as the International Mother Language Day in commemoration of the Bengali Language Movement in 1952. [161]

[163] Along with other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages , Assamese evolved at least before the 7th century CE [164] from the middle Indo-Aryan Magadhi Prakrit . Assamese is unusual among Eastern Indo-Aryan languages for the presence of the /x/ (which, phonetically, varies between velar ([ x ]) and a uvular ([ χ ]) pronunciations). The first characteristics of this language are seen in the Charyapadas composed in between the eighth and twelfth centuries. The first examples emerged in writings of court poets in the fourteenth century, the finest example of which is Madhav Kandali's Saptakanda Ramayana composed during 14th century CE, which was the first translation of the Ramayana into an Indo-Aryan language .

Overseas Indians ( ISO : Pravāsī Bhāratīya), officially Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and People of Indian Origin (PIOs) are Indians who reside or originate outside of India, Bangladesh [28] , Pakistan [29] and Sri Lanka [30] . [31] [32] According to the Government of India , Non-Resident Indians are citizens of India who currently are not living in India, while the term People of Indian Origin refers to people of Indian birth or ancestry who are citizens of countries other than India (with some exceptions). Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) is given to People of Indian Origin and to persons who are not People of Indian Origin but married to Indian citizen or People of Indian Origin. Persons with OCI status are known as Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs). [33] The OCI status is a permanent visa for visiting India with a foreign passport.
According to the Ministry of External Affairs report updated on 26 November 2024, there are 35.4 million non-resident Indians (NRIs) and People of Indian Origins (PIOs) (including OCIs) residing outside India. The Indian diaspora comprise the world's largest overseas diaspora. [1] Every year, 2.5 million (25 lakh) Indians immigrate overseas, making India the nation with  the highest annual number of emigrants in the world. [34]
Legal framework
[ edit ]
Strictly, the term Non-resident Indian refers only to the tax status of an Indian citizen who, as per section 6 of The Income-tax Act, 1961 , has not resided in India for a specified period for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. [35] The rates of income tax are different for persons who are ""resident in India"" and for NRIs. For the purposes of the Income Tax Act, ""residence in India"" requires stay in India of at least 182 days in a financial year or 365 days spread out over four consecutive years and at least 60 days in that year. According to the act, any Indian citizen who does not meet the criteria as a ""resident of India"" is a non-resident of India and is treated as NRI for paying income tax.
Seafarers are not considered NRIs. However, as they work out of India, often for more than 182 days, their income is taxed as that of NRIs while they enjoy all the other rights of a citizen.
Person of Indian Origin (PIO)
A Person of Indian Origin (PIO) [36] means a foreign citizen (except a national of Pakistan , Afghanistan , Bangladesh , China , Iran , Bhutan , Sri Lanka and/or Nepal ), who:
previously held an Indian passport ,
either of whose parents/grandparents/great-grandparents were born and permanently resided in India as defined in Government of India Act, 1935 and other territories that became part of India thereafter provided neither was at any time a citizen of any of the aforesaid countries (as referred above), or
is a spouse of a citizen of India or of a PIO.
Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI)
Main article: Overseas Citizenship of India
After multiple efforts by leaders across the Indian political spectrum, a long term visa scheme was established. It is entitled the ""Overseas Citizenship of India"", and is commonly referred to as the OCI card. The name is itself misleading, as it doesn't offer Indian citizenship. The Constitution of India does not permit full dual citizenship. The OCI card is effectively a long-term visa, with restrictions on voting rights and government jobs. The card is available to certain Overseas ex-Indians, and while it affords holders residency and other rights, it does have restrictions, and is not considered to be any type of Indian citizenship from a constitutional perspective.
Prime minister Narendra Modi announced on 28 September 2014 that PIO and OCI cards would be merged. [37] On 9 January 2015, the Person of Indian Origin Card scheme was withdrawn by the Government of India and was merged with the Overseas Citizen of India card scheme. PIO cardholders must apply to convert their existing cards into OCI cards. The Bureau of Immigration stated that it would continue to accept the old PIO cards as valid travel documents until 31 December 2023. [38]

Notes:
1.
People of Indian Origin (PIO) refers to people of Indian birth or ancestry who are not citizens of India, but are citizens of other nations. Those PIOs who have availed of the Overseas Citizenship of India status through OCI card are known as Overseas Citizen of India (OCI). The card issued to PIOs earlier known as PIO card has been merged into OCI card since 2014.
2.
Overseas Citizens of India can include both PIO OCIs and non-PIO OCIs. As additionally foreign nationals who marry Indian citizens can also avail of the OCI card and become OCI, thus Non-PIO OCIs are excluded here since they are not part of the Indian diaspora.
History of emigration from India
[ edit ]
Narimsimhan et al. (2019) [40] have found that there was an ""Indus periphery"" population living in Central Asia during the Bronze Age . They had migrated from the Indus Valley Civilisation and had settled down in BMAC settlements to trade, this is corroborated by the discovery of Indus Valley seals in Central Asia. [41]
The modern Indian merchant diaspora in Central Asia and Arabia emerged in the mid-16th century and remained active for over four centuries. Astrakhan at the mouth of the Volga was the first place in the Tsardom of Russia where an Indian merchant colony was established as early as the 1610s. Russian chroniclers reported the presence of Hindu traders in Moscow and St Petersburg in the 18th century. [42]
Individuals of Indian origin have achieved a high demographic profile in metropolitan areas worldwide, including India Square (Little Bombay [43] ) in Jersey City , New Jersey , United States, home to the highest concentration of Asian Indians in the Western Hemisphere . [44] [45] [46] [47]
Multani people from Multan , Shikarpur and Mawar of both Hindu and Muslim background acted as bankers and merchants in Safavid Persia. Hindu merchants in Hamadan were massacred by Ottomans as stated by an Armenian, with the Indian merchant community plummeting due to the Ottoman and Afghan wars in Iran (1722–27) . [48] In Kerman , traders of Hindu background had a caravanserai . [49] Traders of Indian background were mentioned by Jean Chardin, Jean de Thévenot, Adam Olearius and F. A. Kotov in the Safavid dynasty in Persia where they lived along with Jews and Armenians. Traders from India of Sikh and Hindu background lived in the Qajar and Zand dynasties in Persia after a clampdown by Nader Shah and the Afghan Ghilzar wars in Iran. [50]
Sarmarqandi and Bukharan traders bought Indian indigo from merchants of Hindu origin in Kandahar in 1783 according to George Forester. The tallest houses were owned by Hindus according to Elphinstone in 1815. Lumsden recorded 350 stores owned by Hindus in Kandahar . Finance, precious metals, and textiles were all dealt with by Sikhs and Hindus in Kandahar. [51]
A Hindu worked for Timur Shah Durrani in Afghanistan. Peshawar Hindus were in Kabul by 1783. Money lending was the main occupation of Hindus in Kabul. Armenians and Hindus lived in Kabul according to an 1876 survey. [52] Jews and Hindus lived in Herat in the 1800s. [53] Sindhi Shikarpur Hindus, Jews, and Arabs lived in Balkh in 1886. [54] Sindhi and Punjabi were the languages used by Indians in Afghanistan. Some Afghan cities including Kabul have places of worship for Hindus and Sikhs. [55] Local citizenship has been obtained in Afghanistan by Hindu and Sikh traders. [56]
Peshawari and Shikarpuri Indian traders were involved in Central Asia. The Shikarpuri invested in grain in the Bukharan Emirate as well as Ferghana cotton. They also engaged in legal money lending in Bukhara, which they could not legally do in Russian Turkestan . [57] Jews, Hindus, Baluch, Persians, and Arabs lived in Samarkand, and Hindus and Baháʼís live in Baluchistan and Khorasan in Iran. [58]
Uyghur merchants would harass Hindu usurers by screaming at them asking them if they ate beef or hanging cow skins on their quarters. Uyghur men also rioted and attacked Hindus for marrying Uyghur women in 1907 in Poskam and Yarkand like Ditta Ram calling for their beheading and stoning Indians to death as they engaged in anti-Hindu violence. [59] Hindu Indian usurers engaging in a religious procession led to violence against them by Muslim Uyghurs. [60] In 1896 two Uyghur Turkis attacked a Hindu merchant and the British consul Macartney demanded the Uyghurs be punished by flogging. [61]
The money lenders and merchants of Hindu background from British India in Xinjiang were guaranteed by the British Consul-General. [62] [63] Russian refugees, missionaries, and British-Indian merchants and money lenders of Hindu background were potential targets of gangs of Kashgaris so the Consulate-General of Britain was a potential shelter. [64] [65] The killings of two Hindus at the hands of Uighurs took place in the Shamba Bazaar [66] in a most brutal fashion. [67] [68] [69] The plundering of the valuables of slaughtered British Indian Hindus happened in Posgam on 25 March 1933, and on the previous day in Karghalik at the hands of Uighurs . [70] Killings of Hindus took place in Khotan at the hands of the Bughra Amirs. [71] Antagonism against both the British and Hindus ran high among the Muslim Turki Uyghur rebels in Xinjiang's southern area. Muslims plundered the possessions in Karghalik of Rai Sahib Dip Chand, who was the aksakal of Britain, and his fellow Hindus on 24 March 1933, and in Keryia they slaughtered British Indian Hindus. [72] Sind's Shikarpur district was the origin of the Hindu diaspora there. The slaughter of the Hindus from British India was called the ""Karghalik Outrage"". The Muslims had killed nine of them. [73] The forced removal of the Swedes was accompanied by the slaughter of the Hindus in Khotan by the Islamic Turkic rebels. [74] The Emirs of Khotan slaughtered the Hindus as they forced the Swedes out and declared sharia in Khotan on 16 March 1933. [75]

A major emigration from the Indian subcontinent was to Southeast Asia . There is a possibility that the first wave of Indian migration towards Southeast Asia occurred when Emperor Ashoka invaded Kalinga and following Samudragupta 's expedition towards the South. [76] This was followed by early interaction of Indian traders with South Asians and, after the mid-first millennium CE, by the emigration of members of the Brahmin social caste . This resulted in the establishment of the Indianised kingdoms in Southeast Asia. The Chola rulers , who were known for their naval power, conquered Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula .

Another early diaspora, of which little is known, was a reported Indian ""Shendu"" community that was recorded when Yunnan was annexed by the Han dynasty in the 1st century by the Chinese authorities. [77]

Gujarati and Sindhi merchants and traders settled in the Arabian Peninsula , Aden , Oman , Bahrain , Dubai , South Africa and East African countries, most of which were ruled by the British. The Indian Rupee was the legal currency in many countries of Arabian peninsula. Punjabi, Rajasthani, Sindhi, Baloch and Kashmiri Camel drivers were brought to Australia. [78] [79]
Post-independence
[ edit ]
After gaining independence from the British Raj , unlike internal migration, senior government leaders have historically not vocalized opinions on international emigration. As a result, it remains a political issue only in states with major emigrant populations, such as Kerala , Punjab , Tamil Nadu and to a lesser degree Gujarat , Andhra Pradesh and Goa . However, the phenomenon continues to be a major force in India's economic ( foreign direct investment ), social and political relations with nations having significant Indian populace.[ citation needed ] For example, the 2008 signing of the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement was helped by intense lobbying from Indian Americans .

Indians in Madagascar are descended mostly from traders who arrived in 19th century looking for better opportunities. The majority of them came from the Indian west coast state of Gujarat and were known as Karana (Muslim) and Bania (Hindu). The majority speak Gujarati , though some other Indian languages are spoken. Nowadays, the younger generations speak at least three languages; these languages include French or English, Gujarati and Malagasy .[ citation needed ]

The people are known as Indo-Mauritians , and form about 65.8% of the population. The majority of them are Hindu (73.7%) and a significant group are Muslims (26.3%). Mauritius is the only Hindu majority (48.5%) country of Africa according to the 2011 census. There are also a relatively small number of Baháʼís and Sikhs . The mother tongue of Indo-Mauritians is Creole , as well as French and English in general fields, however various Indian languages are still spoken, especially Bhojpuri , Tamil , Hindi , Marathi , Odia , Telugu , and Urdu as they are used in religious activities.
Mauritius hosts the Aapravasi Ghat , the only site of UNESCO in the world, to pay homage to the memory of indenture . The Indian Festivals of Maha Shivaratri , Diwali , Thaipusam , Ponggal , Ganesh Chaturthi and Ugadi are all National Holidays as well as the Annual Commemoration of the Arrival of Indian Indentured Labourers in Mauritius.

Most Asians in South Africa are descended from indentured Indian labourers who were brought by the British from India in the 19th century, mostly to work on the sugar cane plantations of what is now the province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). The majority are of Tamil speaking heritage along with people that speak Hindi or Bhojpuri , mostly descending from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. There are also smaller numbers of Telugu speaking communities while a minority are descended from Indian traders who migrated to South Africa at around the same time, many from Gujarat. The city of Durban has the highest number of Asians in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi worked as a lawyer in the country in the early 1900s. South Africa has one of the highest number of people of Indian descent outside of India in the world, i.e. born in South Africa and not migrant. Most of them are fourth or fifth-generation descendants. Most Indian South Africans do not speak any Indian languages, as they were 'lost' over the generations, although some do enjoy watching Indian movies and listening to Indian music , and they maintain (and have had imposed upon them) a strong Indian racial identity as a consequence of the legacy of Apartheid . [169]
East Africa
Sir Ben Kingsley of Indo-Kenyan descent is a notable Oscar-winning actor
Farrokh Bulsara, better known as Freddie Mercury , lead singer and co-founder of the immensely successful rock band Queen , was of Parsi descent born in Zanzibar .
Before the larger wave of migration during the British colonial era, a significant group of South Asians, especially from the west coast ( Sindh , Surat , Konkan and Malabar ) travelled regularly to South East Africa, especially Zanzibar. It is believed that they travelled in Arab dhows , Maratha Navy ships (under Kanhoji Angre ), and possibly Chinese junks and Portuguese vessels. Some of these people settled in South-East Africa and later spread to places like present day Uganda, and Mozambique. Later they mingled with the much larger wave of South Asians who came with the British.
Indian migration to the modern countries of Kenya, Uganda, Mauritius, South Africa, and Tanzania began nearly a century ago when these parts of the continent were under British and French colonial rule. Most of these migrants were of Gujarati or Punjabi origin. There are almost three million Indians living in South-East Africa. Indian-led businesses were (or are) the backbone of the economies of these countries. These ranged in the past from small rural grocery stores to sugar mills . In addition, Indian professionals, such as doctors, teachers, engineers, also played an important part in the development of these countries.

Manoj Punjabi is an Indian Indonesian film and television producer and owner of the biggest production house in Indonesia.
The official figures, it is estimated that there are around 125,000 Indians living in Indonesia and 25,000 PIOs/NRIs living in Indonesia of which the Indian expatriate community registered with the embassy and consulate in Medan numbers around 5,000-7,000 people. Most are from Tamil descendants.
Indians have been living in Indonesia for centuries, from the time of the Srivijaya and Majapahit Empire both of which were Hindu and heavily influenced by the subcontinent. Indians were later brought to Indonesia by the Dutch in the 19th century as indentured labourers to work on plantations located around Medan in Sumatra. While the majority of these came from South India, a significant number also came from the north of India. The Medan Indians included Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. They have now been in Indonesia for over four generations and hold Indonesian passports . While local statistics continue to suggest that there are some 40,000 PIOs in Sumatra, the vast majority are now completely assimilated into Indonesian society, though some elements of the Tamil, Punjabi and Odia communities still maintain their cultural traditions.
The Indian diaspora also includes several thousand Sindhi families who constitute the second wave of Indian immigrants who made Indonesia their home in the first half of the 20th century. The Sindhi community is mainly engaged in trading and commerce .
Among these communities, Tamils and to a lesser extent Sikhs were primarily engaged in agriculture while Sindhis and Punjabis mainly established themselves in textile trade and sports businesses.
The inflow of major Indian investments in Indonesia starting in the late 1970s drew a fresh wave of Indian investors and managers to this country. This group of entrepreneurs and business professionals has further expanded over the past two decades and now includes engineers, consultants, chartered accountants, bankers and other professionals.
The Indian community is very well regarded in Indonesia, is generally prosperous, and includes individuals holding senior positions in local and multinational companies.
Due to economic factors, most traders and businessmen among PIOs have over past decades moved to Jakarta from outlying areas such as Medan and Surabaya . Almost half the Indian Community in Indonesia is now Jakarta-based; it is estimated that the population of Jakarta's Indian community is about 19,000. [177] There are six main social or professional associations in Jakarta's Indian PIO/NRI community. Gandhi Seva Loka (formerly known as Bombay Merchants Association) is a charitable institution run by the Sindhi community and is engaged mainly in educational and social activities. The India Club is a social organisation of PIO/NRI professionals. An Indian Women's Association brings together PIO/NRI spouses and undertakes charitable activities. There is a Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee in Jakarta and Sindhis as well, Sikhs are associated with Gurudwara activities. The Economic Association of Indonesia and India (ECAII) brings together leading entrepreneurs from the Indian community with the objective of promoting bilateral economic relations, but it has been largely inactive. Finally, there is the Indonesian Chapter of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).
Malaysia
Former World No. 1 of women's squash, Malaysia's Nicol David , is of Chindian descent.
Malaysia has one of the world's largest overseas Indian and overseas Chinese populations. Most Indians migrated to Malaysia as plantation labourers under British rule. They are a significant minority ethnic group, making up 8% or 2,410,000 as 2017 of the Malaysian population. 85% of these people are Tamil-speaking. They have retained their languages and religion – 88% of ethnic Indians in Malaysia identify as Hindus. A minority number of the population are Sikhs and Muslims.
There is also a small community of Indian origin, the Chitty , who are the descendants of only Tamil traders who had emigrated before 1500 CE. Considering themselves Tamil, speaking Malay, and practicing Hinduism, the Chittys number about 200,000 today.
Philippines

Currently, there are over 150,000 people of Indian origin residing in Philippines. [178] By law, Indian Filipinos are defined as Philippine citizens of Indian descent.
India and the Philippines have historic cultural and economic ties going back over 3,000 years. Iron Age finds in the Philippines point to the existence of trade between Tamil Nadu in South India and what are today the Philippine Islands during the ninth and tenth centuries BCE. [179] The influence of Indian culture on Filipino cultures intensified from the 2nd through the late 14th centuries CE, impacting various fields such as language, politics, and religion. [180]
During the Seven Years' War , Indians from Chennai , and Tamil Nadu were part of the British expedition against Spanish Manila , taking the city from the Spanish East Indies government and occupying the surrounding areas until Caintâ and Morong (today in Rizal province) between 1762 and 1763. Following the end war's end, a number of Indian soldiers mutinied, settled, and married local Tagalog women. These Sepoy Indians still have descendants in the town today. [181] [182]
Singapore
V. Sundramoorthy is a former Singapore international footballer and currently the head coach of S.League club Tampines Rovers .
Indian Singaporeans – defined as persons of South Asian paternal ancestry – form 9% of the country's citizens and permanent residents, [183] making them Singapore 's third largest ethnic group. Among cities, Singapore has one of the largest overseas Indian populations.
Although contact with ancient India left a deep cultural impact on Singapore's indigenous Malay society, the mass migration of ethnic Indians to the island only began with the founding of modern Singapore by the British in 1819. Initially, the Indian population was transient, mainly comprising young men who came as workers, soldiers and convicts. By the mid-20th century, a settled community had emerged, with a more balanced gender ratio and a better spread of age groups . Tamil is one among the four official languages of Singapore alongside English, Chinese and Malay.
Singapore's Indian population is notable for its class stratification , with disproportionately large elite and lower income groups. This long-standing problem has grown more visible since the 1990s with an influx of both well-educated and unskilled migrants from India, and as part of growing income inequality in Singapore. Indians earn higher incomes than Malays, the other major minority group. Indians are also significantly more likely to hold university degrees than these groups. However, the mainly locally born Indian students in public primary and secondary schools under-perform the national average at major examinations.
Singapore Indians are linguistically and religiously diverse, with South Indians and Hindus forming majorities. Indian culture has endured and evolved over almost 200 years. By the mid to late 20th century, it had become somewhat distinct from contemporary South Asian cultures, even as Indian elements became diffused within a broader Singaporean culture . Since the 1990s, new Indian immigrants have increased the size and complexity of the local Indian population. Together with modern communications like cable television and the Internet , this has connected Singapore with an emerging global Indian culture.
Prominent Indian individuals have long made a mark in Singapore as leaders of various fields in national life. Indians are also collectively well-represented, and sometimes over-represented, in areas such as politics , education , diplomacy and the law .
There is also a small community of Indian origin, the Chitty , who are the descendants of Tamil traders who had emigrated before 1500 CE. Considering themselves Tamil, speaking Tamil, and practice Hinduism, the Chittys number about 2,000 today.

There are over 28,000 Indian citizens in Armenia , including those who are seeking permanent residence status in Armenia, as recorded in 2018. In the first half of 2018, 10,237 Indians crossed Armenia's borders, and more than 2,000 were seeking permanent residence status. [99] [184]
Israel
Main articles: Indians in Israel , Bene Israel , and Bnei Menashe
The Bene Israel ( Hebrew : בני ישראל, ""Sons of Israel"") are an ancient group of Jews who migrated in the 18th century from villages in the Konkan area to nearby Indian cities, primarily Mumbai , but also to Pune , and Ahmedabad . In the second half of the 20th century, most of them emigrated to Israel , where they now number about 85,000. The native language of the Bene Israel is Judæo-Marathi , a form of Marathi.
Another prominent community that migrated to Israel after its creation were the Jews of Cochin , in Kerala ( Cochin Jews ) – a community with a very long history. They are known to have been granted protection by the king of the Princely State of Cochin . The earliest Jews in this region, as per local tradition, date to as early as 379 CE. The community was a mix of native Jews (called ""Black Jews""), and European Jews (called ""White Jews"") who had emigrated to Cochin after the successive European conquests of Cochin. The Jewish community of Cochin spoke a variant of Malayalam , called Judeo-Malayalam . The community, after the creation of Israel, saw a mass exodus from Cochin, and is presently facing extinction in India.
Still another group of Indians to arrive in Israel belong to the Bnei Menashe (""Children of Menasseh "", Hebrew בני מנשה) a group of more than 10,000 people from India's North-Eastern border states of Manipur and Mizoram , who claim descent from one of the Lost Tribes of Israel , and of whom about 3,700 now live in Israel (some of them in Israeli settlements on the West Bank ). Linguistically, Bnei Menashe are Tibeto-Burmans and belong to the Mizo , Kuki and Chin peoples (the terms are virtually interchangeable). [185] The move to convert them to Judaism and bring them to Israel is politically controversial in both India and Israel. [186]
Persian Gulf
[ edit ]
Indians command a dominant majority of the population Persian Gulf countries . After the 1970s oil boom in the Middle East , numerous Indians from Kerala emigrated, taking advantage of close historical ties with the 'Gulf' as well as the lack of ample skilled labour from nearby Africa and the Middle East . Major urban centres such as Dubai , Abu Dhabi , Doha and Manama were experiencing a development boom and thousands of Indians laboured in construction industries.
This work was done on a contractual basis rather than permanently, and working age men continued to return home every few years. This has remained the dominant pattern as the countries in the Persian Gulf, especially United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Qatar and Kuwait have a common policy of not naturalising non-Arabs, even if they are born there.
The Persian Gulf region has provided incomes many times over for the same type of job in India and has geographical proximity to India, and these incomes are free of taxation.[ citation needed ] The NRIs make up a good proportion of the working class in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). NRI population in these GCC countries is estimated to be around 20 million, of which a quarter is resident in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). [187] In 2005, about 75% of the population in the UAE was of Indian descent. The majority originate from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka, and Goa. Similarly, Indians are the single largest nationality in Qatar, representing around 85% of the total population as of 2014. [188] They also form majorities in Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman.
Since the early 2000s, significant number of Indians have reached the region, taking up high skill jobs in business and industry. Major Indian corporations maintain solid regional presence there while some are headquartered there.
There is a huge population of NRIs in West Asia, most coming from Kerala and Andhra Pradesh . They work as engineers, doctors, lawyers, labourers and in clerical jobs.[ citation needed ] Unlike in Europe and America, most of the countries in West Asia do not grant citizenship or permanent residency to these Indians, however long they might live there. They have a minority in Saudi Arabia. The NRI population tends to save and remit considerable amounts to their dependents in India. It is estimated such remittances may be over US$10 billion per annum (including remittances by formal and informal channels in 2007–2008). The relative ease with which people can travel to their home country means that many NRIs in the Gulf and West Asia maintain close links to Indian culture, with people often travelling twice or thrice a year, especially during holiday period, while some live in India for several months each year. Satellite television allows many NRIs to consume Indian media and entertainment, and there are TV soaps aimed at the NRI community in the Gulf countries. Live performances and cultural events, such as Tiarts for Goans living in UAE, occur quite often and are staged by community groups.[ citation needed ]

From 1838 to 1917, over half a million Indians from the former British India were brought to the Caribbean as indentured labourers to address the demand for labour following the abolition of slavery . The first two ships arrived in British Guiana (now Guyana ) on 5 May 1838.
The majority of the Indians living in the English-speaking Caribbean and Suriname migrated from the Bhojpur region in present-day eastern Uttar Pradesh , western Bihar and northwestern Jharkhand and the Awadh region in eastern Uttar Pradesh, while a significant minority came from South India . [189] Most of the Indians brought to Guadeloupe , Martinique , Saint Lucia and French Guiana were mostly from Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana , and other parts of South India. [190] A minority emigrated from other parts of South Asia. Other Indo-Caribbean people are descend from or are later migrants, including Indian doctors, businessmen, and other professionals. Many of them being of Sindhi , Punjabi , Gujarati , Kutchi , Bengali , Tamil , and Telugu origin. [191] [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] [197] [198] Many Indo-Caribbean people have further migrated and settled to other countries, such as the United States , Canada , the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and France , with sizable populations in the metropolitan areas of New York , Toronto , Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach , Orlando - Ocala , Minneapolis–Saint Paul , Tampa Bay , Winnipeg , Montreal , Vancouver , Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land , Washington, D.C. , Schenectady , Calgary , London , Rotterdam-Den Haag , and Amsterdam . [199]
Indo-Caribbean people are the largest ethnic group in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. They are the second largest group in Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and other countries. There are small populations of them in Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, French Guiana, Grenada, Panama, Guatemala, St. Lucia, Haiti, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and the Netherlands Antilles.

Indian cuisine
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Culinary tradition
For the cuisine of Indigenous people of the Americas, see Indigenous cuisine of the Americas .
This article is part of the series on
e
Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent . Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices , herbs , vegetables , and fruits .
Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam , cultural choices and traditions. [1] [2] Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to India. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruits. A number of these such as potatoes , tomatoes , chillies , peanuts , and guava have become staples in many regions of India. [3]
Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations ; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery . [4] Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe ( Britain in particular), the Middle East , Southern African , East Africa , Southeast Asia , North America , Mauritius , Fiji , Oceania , and the Caribbean . [5] [6]
World Wildlife Fund (WWF)’s Living Planet Report released on 10 October 2024 emphasized India’s food consumption pattern as the most sustainable among the big economies ( G20 countries ). [7]
History
Main article: History of Indian cuisine
Indian cuisine reflects an 8,000-year history of various groups and cultures interacting with the Indian subcontinent , leading to diversity of flavours and regional cuisines found in modern-day India. Later, trade with British and Portuguese influence added to the already diverse Indian cuisine. [8] [9]
Prehistory and Indus Valley civilization
See also: Meluhha , Indus–Mesopotamia relations , and Indian maritime history
After 9000 BCE, a first period of indirect contacts between Fertile Crescent and Indus Valley civilizations seems to have occurred as a consequence of the Neolithic Revolution and the diffusion of agriculture. Wheat and barley were first grown around 7000 BCE, when agriculture spread from the Fertile Crescent to the Indus Valley. Sesame and humped cattle were domesticated in the local farming communities. Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in South Asia .
By 3000 BCE, turmeric , cardamom , black pepper and mustard were harvested in India.
From Around 2350 BCE the evidence for imports from the Indus to Ur in Mesopotamia have been found, as well as Clove heads which are thought to originate from the Moluccas in Maritime Southeast Asia were found in a 2nd millennium BC site in Terqa . Akkadian Empire records mention timber, carnelian and ivory as being imported from Meluhha by Meluhhan ships, Meluhha being generally considered as the Mesopotamian name for the Indus Valley Civilization.

The ancient Hindu text Mahabharata mentions rice and vegetable cooked together, and the word ""pulao"" or ""pallao"" is used to refer to the dish in ancient Sanskrit works, such as Yājñavalkya Smṛti . Ayurveda , ancient Indian system of wellness, deals with holistic approach to the wellness, and it includes food, dhyana (meditation) and yoga .
Antiquity
Early diet in India mainly consisted of legumes , vegetables , fruits , grains , dairy products , and honey .[ citation needed ] Staple foods eaten today include a variety of lentils ( dal ), whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), rice, and pearl millet (bājra), which has been cultivated in the Indian subcontinent since 6200 BCE. [9]
Over time, segments of the population embraced vegetarianism during the Śramaṇa movement [10] [11] while an equitable climate permitted a variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains to be grown throughout the year.
A food classification system that categorised any item as saatvic , raajsic , or taamsic developed in Yoga tradition. [12] [13] The Bhagavad Gita proscribes certain dietary practices (chapter 17, verses 8–10). [14]
Consumption of beef is taboo , due to cows being considered sacred in Hinduism. [15] Beef is generally not eaten by Hindus in India except for Kerala , parts of southern Tamil Nadu and the north-east. [16]
Ingredients mentioned in ancient Indian scripture
Pomegranate
While many ancient Indian recipes have been lost in history, one can look at ancient texts to see what was eaten in ancient and pre-historic India.
Barley [17] —(known as Yava in both Vedic and Classical Sanskrit ) is mentioned many times in Rigveda and other Indian scriptures as one of the principal grains in ancient India
Betel leaf [18] —primary use is as a wrapper for the chewing of areca nut or tobacco , where it is mainly used to add flavour; may also be used in cooking, usually raw, for its peppery taste
Breadfruit — fritters called jeev kadge phodi in Konkani [19] or kadachakka varuthath [20] in Malayalam are a local delicacy in coastal Karnataka and Kerala
Chickpeas [21] —popular dishes are made with chickpea flour, such as mirchi bajji and mirapakaya bajji
Curd —a traditional yogurt or fermented milk product, originating from the Indian subcontinent, usually prepared from cow's milk, and sometimes buffalo milk, or goat milk
Figs [17] —cultivated from Afghanistan to Portugal , also grown in Pithoragarh in the Kumaon hills of India ; from the 15th century onwards, also grown in areas including Northern Europe and the New World
Ghee —a class of clarified butter that originated in ancient India, commonly used in the Indian subcontinent, Middle-Eastern cuisine, traditional medicine, and religious rituals
Grape wine [22] —first-known mention of grape -based wines in India is from the late 4th-century BC writings of Chanakya
Honey [23] —the spiritual and supposed therapeutic use of honey in ancient India was documented in both the Vedas and the Ayurveda texts
Mango —the Jain goddess Ambika is traditionally represented as sitting under a mango tree
Mustard [17] — brown mustard is a spice that was cultivated in the Indus Valley civilization and is one of the important spices used in the Indian subcontinent today

Turmeric [22] —used widely as a spice in South Asian and Middle Eastern cooking
Middle Ages to the 16th century
During the Middle Ages , several Indian dynasties were predominant, including the Gupta dynasty . Travel to India during this time introduced new cooking methods and products to the region, including tea .[ citation needed ]
India was later invaded by tribes from Central Asian cultures, which led to the emergence of Mughlai cuisine , a mix of Indian and Central Asian cuisine . Hallmarks include seasonings such as saffron . [26]
Colonial Period
The Portuguese and British during their rule introduced cooking techniques such as baking, and foods from the New World and Europe. The new-world vegetables popular in cuisine from the Indian subcontinent include maize , tomato , potato , sweet potatoes , peanuts , squash , and chilli .

Spices at a grocery shop in India
Staple foods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (bājra), rice , whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), and a variety of lentils , such as masoor (most often red lentils ), tuer ( pigeon peas ), urad (black gram), and moong ( mung beans ). Lentils may be used whole, dehusked—for example, dhuli moong or dhuli urad—or split. Split lentils, or dal, are used extensively. [31] Some pulses , such as channa or cholae ( chickpeas ), rajma ( kidney beans ), and lobiya ( black-eyed peas ) are very common, especially in the northern regions. Channa and moong are also processed into flour ( besan ).
Many Indian dishes are cooked in vegetable oil , but peanut oil is popular in northern and western India, mustard oil in eastern India, [26] and coconut oil along the western coast, especially in Kerala and parts of southern Tamil Nadu. [32] [ self-published source? ] Gingelly (sesame) oil is common in the south since it imparts a fragrant, nutty aroma. [33]
In recent decades, sunflower , safflower , cottonseed , and soybean oils have become popular across India. [34] Hydrogenated vegetable oil, known as Vanaspati ghee, is another popular cooking medium. [35] Butter-based ghee , or deshi ghee, is used commonly.
Many types of meat are used for Indian cooking, but chicken and mutton tend to be the most commonly consumed meats. Fish and beef consumption are prevalent in some parts of India, but they are not widely consumed except for coastal areas, as well as the north east.[ citation needed ]

One popular spice mix is garam masala , a powder that typically includes seven dried spices in a particular ratio, including black cardamom , cinnamon (dalchini), clove (laung), cumin (jeera), black peppercorns, coriander seeds and anise star . [37] [ self-published source? ]. Each culinary region has a distinctive garam masala blend—individual chefs may also have their own.
The spices chosen for a dish are freshly ground and then fried in hot oil or ghee to create a paste. The process is called bhuna, the name also being used for a type of curry . [38]
There are other spice blends which are popular in various regions. Panch phoron is a spice blend which is popular in eastern India. Goda masala is a sweet spice mix which is popular in Maharashtra . Some leaves commonly used for flavouring include bay leaves ( tejpat ), coriander leaves, fenugreek ( methi ) leaves, and mint leaves. The use of curry leaves and roots for flavouring is typical of Gujarati [39] and South Indian cuisine . [40] Sweet dishes are often seasoned with cardamom, saffron , nutmeg , and rose petal essences.

Shorshe Pabda ( Pabo catfish in mustard paste)
During the 19th century, many Odia-speaking cooks were employed in Bengal , [53] which led to the transfer of several food items between the two regions. Bengali cuisine is the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the Indian subcontinent that is analogous in structure to the modern service à la russe style of French cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once. [54]

East Bengali food, which has a high presence in West Bengal and Bangladesh, is much spicier than the West Bengali cuisine, and tends to use high amounts of chilli, and is one of the spiciest cuisines in India and the World.
Shondesh and Rashogolla are popular dishes made of sweetened, finely ground fresh cheese. For the latter, West Bengal and neighboring Odisha both claim to be the origin of dessert. Each state also has a geographical indication for their regional variety of rasgulla. [57] [58]

Manipur
Main article: Manipuri cuisine
Eromba, here vegetarian, is a popular Manipuri dish.
Manipuri cuisine is represented by the cuisine of the Meitei people who form the majority population in the central plain. Meitei food are simple, tasty, organic and healthy. Rice with local seasonal vegetables and fish form the main diet.
Most of the dishes are cooked like vegetable stew, flavored with either fermented fish called ngari, or dried and smoked fish.
The most popular Manipuri dish is eromba , a preparation of boiled and mashed vegetables, often including carrots, potatoes or beans , mixed with chilli and roasted fermented fish .
Another popular dish is the savory cake called paknam, made of a lentil flour stuffed with various ingredients such as banana inflorescence, mushrooms , fish, vegetables etc., and baked covered in turmeric leaves.
Along with spicy dishes, a mild side dish of steamed or boiled sweet vegetables are often served in the daily meals. The Manipuri salad dish called singju , made of finely julienned cabbage , green papaya , and other vegetables, and garnished with local herbs, toasted sesame powder and lentil flour is extremely popular locally, and often found sold in small street side vendors.
Singju is often served with bora, which are fritters of various kinds, and also kanghou, or oil-fried spicy veggies. [150] Cooked and fermented soybean is a popular condiment in all Manipuri kitchens.
The staple diet of Manipur consists of rice, fish, large varieties of leafy vegetables (of both aquatic and terrestrial). Manipuris typically raise vegetables in a kitchen garden and rear fishes in small ponds around their house. Since the vegetables are either grown at home or obtained from local market, the cuisines are very seasonal, each season having its own special vegetables and preparations.
The taste is very different from mainland Indian cuisines because of the use of various aromatic herbs and roots that are peculiar to the region. They are however very similar to the cuisines of Southeast , East , and Central Asia , Siberia , Micronesia and Polynesia .
Meghalaya
Main article: Meghalayan cuisine
Jadoh with mutton is characteristic of Meghalayan cuisine.
Meghalayan cuisine is unique and different from other Northeastern Indian states. [151] Spiced meat is common, from goats, pigs, fowl, ducks, chickens, and cows. In the Khasi and Jaintia Hills districts , common foods include jadoh, ki kpu, tung-rymbai , [152] and pickled bamboo shoots .
Other common foods in Meghalaya include minil songa (steamed sticky rice ) and sakkin gata.
Like other tribes in the northeast, the Garos ferment rice beer , which they consume in religious rites and secular celebrations. [153]
Mizoram
Main article: Mizo cuisine
The cuisine of Mizoram differs from that of most of India, though it shares characteristics to other regions of Northeast India and North India.
Rice is the staple food of Mizoram, while Mizos love to add non-vegetarian ingredients in every dish. Fish, chicken, pork and beef are popular meats among Mizos. Dishes are served on fresh banana leaves . Most of the dishes are cooked in mustard oil .
Meals tend to be less spicy than in most of India. Mizos love eating boiled vegetables along with rice. A popular dish is bai, made from boiling vegetables (spinach, eggplant, beans, and other leafy vegetables) with bekang (fermented soya beans) or sa-um, fermented pork fat served with rice. Sawhchiar is another common dish, made of rice and cooked with pork or chicken. [154] [155]
Nagaland
Main article: Naga cuisine
Naga style smoked Pork ribs with bamboo shoots and rice
The cuisine of Nagaland reflects that of the Naga people . It is known for exotic pork meats cooked with simple and flavourful ingredients, [156] like the extremely hot bhut jolokia (ghost chili) pepper, fermented bamboo shoots, and akhuni (fermented soya beans ). Another unique and strong ingredient used by the Naga people, is the fermented fish known as ngari.
Fresh herbs and other local greens also feature prominently in the Naga cuisine. The Naga use oil sparingly, preferring to ferment, dry, and smoke their meats and fish.
Traditional homes in Nagaland have external kitchens that serve as smokehouses . [157]
A typical meal consists of rice, meat, a chutney, a couple of stewed or steamed vegetable dishes, flavored with ngari or akhuni. Desserts usually consist of fresh fruits.
Odisha
The cuisine of Odisha relies heavily on local ingredients. Flavours are usually subtle and delicately spiced. Fish and other seafood, such as crab and shrimp, are very popular, and chicken and mutton are also consumed.
Pakhala Platter
Pakhala , a dish made of rice, water, and dahi (yogurt), that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer in rural areas. [158] Odias are very fond of sweets, so dessert follows most meals.
Panch phutana , a mix of cumin, mustard, fennel, fenugreek and kalonji ( nigella ), is widely used for flavouring vegetables and dals, [159] while garam masala and turmeric are commonly used for meat-based curries.
Popular Odia dishes include arna , kanika , dalma , khata (tamato and oou), dali (different types of lentils, i.e. harada [ red gram ], muga [ green gram ], kolatha [ horsegram ], etc.), spinach and other green leaves, and alu-bharta (mashed potato) [160] along with pakhala.
Odisha and neighboring West Bengal both claim to be the origin of rasgulla , each state having a geographical indication for their regional variety of the dessert. [57] [58] Odisha is also known for its chhena - based sweets, including chhena poda , chhena gaja , chhena jhili , and rasabali .
Puducherry
The union territory of Puducherry was a French colony for around 200 years, making French cuisine a strong influence on the area. Tamil cuisine is eaten by the territory's Tamil majority. The influence of the neighbouring areas, such as Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, is also visible on the territory's cuisine.
Some favourite dishes include coconut curry, tandoori potato, soya dosa , podanlangkai ( snake gourd chutney ), [161] curried vegetables, stuffed cabbage , and baked beans . [162]
Punjab
Main article: Punjabi cuisine
Tandoori chicken is a popular grilled dish in Punjab.
The cuisine of Punjab is known for its diverse range of dishes. It is closely related to the cuisine of the neighbouring Punjab province of Pakistan.
The state, being an agriculture center, is abundant with whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Home-cooked and restaurant Punjabi cuisine can vary significantly.
Restaurant-style Punjabi cooking puts emphasis on creamy textured foods by using ghee, butter and cream, while home-cooked meals center around whole wheat, rice, and other ingredients flavored with various kinds of masalas . [163]
Common dishes cooked at home are roti with daal and dahi (yogurt) with a side chutney and salad that includes raw onion, tomato, cucumber, etc.
The meals are also abundant of local and seasonal vegetables usually sautéed with spices such as cumin, dried coriander, red chili powder, turmeric, black cloves, etc. Masala chai is a favorite drink and is consumed in everyday life and at special occasions.
Many regional differences exist in the Punjabi cuisine based on traditional variations in cooking similar dishes, food combinations, preference of spice combination, etc. It is clear that ""the food is simple, robust, and closely linked to the land."" [164]
Certain dishes exclusive to Punjab, such as makki di roti and sarson da saag , [165] dal makhani , and others are a favorite of many.
The masala in a Punjabi dish traditionally consists of onion, garlic, ginger, cumin, garam masala , salt, turmeric, tomatoes sauteed in mustard oil. Tandoori food is a Punjabi specialty. Dishes like Bhatti da murgh also known as tandoori chicken, Chicken hariyali kabab , Achari paneer tikka , fish ajwaini tikka and Amritsari kulcha are some popular tandoori foods from Punjab.
Punjabi platter.
Common meat dishes in this region are Bhakra curry (goat) and fish dishes. [166] Dairy products are regularly enjoyed and usually accompany main meals in the form of dahi , milk, and milk-derived products such as lassi , paneer , and more.
Punjab has a large number of people following the Sikh religion who traditionally follow a vegetarian diet (which includes plant-derived foods, milk, and milk by-products. See diet in Sikhism ) in accordance to their beliefs.
No description of Punjabi cuisine is complete without the myriad of famous desserts, such as kheer , gajar ka halwa , sooji (cream of wheat) halwa , rasmalai , gulab jamun and jalebi . Most desserts are ghee or dairy-based, use nuts such as almonds, walnuts, pistachios, cashews, and, raisins.
Many of the most popular elements of Anglo-Indian cuisine , such as tandoori foods, naan , pakoras and vegetable dishes with paneer , are derived from Punjabi styles. [167]
Punjabi food is well liked in the world for its flavors, spices, and, versatile use of produce, and so it is one of the most popular cuisines from the sub-continent. Last but not least are the chhole bhature and chhole kulche [168] which are famous all over the North India.
Rajasthan
Main article: Rajasthani cuisine
Rajasthani thali
Cooking in Rajasthan , an arid region, has been strongly shaped by the availability of ingredients. Food is generally cooked in milk or ghee, making it quite rich. Gram flour is a mainstay of Marwari food mainly due to the scarcity of vegetables in the area. [169]
Historically, food that could last for several days and be eaten without heating was preferred. Major dishes of a Rajasthani meal may include daal-baati , tarfini, raabdi, ghevar , bail-gatte, panchkoota, chaavadi, laapsi , kadhi and boondi . Typical snacks include bikaneri bhujia , mirchi bada , pyaaj kachori , and dal kachori .
Daal-baati is the most popular dish prepared in the state. It is usually supplemented with choorma , a mixture of finely ground baked rotis, sugar and ghee. [170]
Rajasthan is also influenced by the Rajput community who have liking for meat dishes. Their diet consisted of game meat and gave birth to dishes like laal maans , safed maas, [171] khad khargosh [172] and jungli maas. [173]
Sikkim

Sindh
See also: Sindhis in India
Sai bhaji is a Sindhi dish.
Sindhi cuisine refers to the native cuisine of the Sindhi people from the Sindh region, now in Pakistan . While Sindh is not geographically a part of modern India, its culinary traditions persist, [175] due to the sizeable number of Hindu Sindhis who migrated to India following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, especially in Sindhi enclaves such as Ulhasnagar and Gandhidam .
A typical meal in many Sindhi households includes wheat-based flatbread ( phulka ) and rice accompanied by two dishes, one with gravy and one dry. Lotus stem (known as kamal kakri) is also used in Sindhi dishes. Cooking vegetables by deep frying is common.
Some regular Sindhi dishes are sindhi kadhi, [176] sai bhaji , koki [177] and besan bhaji. Ingredients frequently used are mango powder, tamarind, kokum flowers , and dried pomegranate seeds. [178]

Priest(s)
Rev. Dr. T.Shantaiah
Medak Cathedral at Medak in Telangana , India , is one of the largest churches in India and has been the cathedral church of the Diocese of Medak of the Church of South India since 1947. [1] Originally built by Charles Walker Posnett British Wesleyan Methodists , it was consecrated on 25 December 1924.
History
)
The Church of South India Cathedral at Medak. It is one of the largest churches in Asia
View of the altar in Medak Cathedral
Medak Cathedral is the seat of the Bishop in Medak for the Church of South India (comprising Wesleyan Methodist , Congregational and Anglican missionary societies - SPG , WMMS , LMS , CMS , and the Church of England ). The cathedral is the largest of all churches in Telangana. The cathedral also sees over the Diocese of Medak which was consecrated on 25 December 1924. Built by the British Wesleyan Methodists, the cathedral is now under the jurisdiction of the Church of South India.
The cathedral's construction was spearheaded by Reverend Charles Walker Posnett, being funded by his family (devoted methodists that had gathered a large wealth owning tanneries in Runcorn), and the local government. Rev. Posnett arrived in Secunderabad in 1895 as a minister for the British soldiers at Trimullghery. Unsatisfied with the army work, he launched forth into villages. In the following year of 1896, Rev. Charles Walker Posnett visited a village called Medak and built a bungalow there by staying in dock bungalow. There was no railway route to Medak in those days. The journey of 60 miles (97 km) from Hyderabad had to be done on horseback and Rev. Posnett could do it in a day. There were then hardly two hundred Christians in the whole of Medak area. When he came to Medak, there was a small tiled house as the place of worship. As the number of Christians increased, he felt the need for expanding the church building. Rev.Posnett soon raised a moderate structure on that very spot just enough for the Christian community within the Mission Compound in the traditional shape of a church. He thought it was not a worthy place for divine worship. He started building the present Cathedral in 1914 on a sprawling 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) of land in Ghusnabad area. The foundations for the new church were laid in the beginning of the year 1914. During the early part of the 20th century, Medak district was reeling under famine and Rev. Posnett in order to provide succour to the suffering masses gave the masses employment in the construction of the church instead of running a free kitchen. The construction work on the cathedral went on for 10 years. The cathedral was consecrated in 1924 by Rev. Posnett expressing his grateful thanks to God for mitigating the sufferings of the people. When several Christian groups became re-united as the Church of South India, the church became the cathedral church of the diocese of Medak in October 1947.
Architecture
[ edit ]
The cathedral is 100 ft (30 m) wide and 200 ft (61 m) long, and conforms to the Gothic Revival style. It can accommodate about 5,000 people at a time. The mosaic tiles were imported from Britain and are of six different colours. Italian masons from Bombay were engaged for laying the decorative flooring. Massive pillars built with fine-hewn and well dressed grey stone support the gallery and the whole edifice. The roof of the church is made sound-proof by means of hollow sponge material, and has an impressive style of vaulting. The surface of the vaulting has the shape of squares. The bell-tower is 175 ft (53 m) high. (It is said that when the nizam of Hyderabad discovered that the church would be higher than the Charminar , he made a vain bid to have its height reduced. [2] )
Stained glass
[ edit ]
The biggest attraction of the cathedral are its stained glass windows depicting different scenes from Christ's life – Ascension behind the altar, Nativity in the west transept, and Crucifixion in the east transept. The windows were designed by Sir. O. Salisbury of England. The stained glass windows were installed at different periods. The chancel window depicting the ascension was installed in 1927, two years after the cathedral was built. The stained glass was arranged by the native of the village Mr. Peram Alexander . The nativity window was installed in 1947 and the crucifixion window was installed in 1958(After Taking Damage,Restored in 1979). [3]
Architects and engineers
[ edit ]
The church, along with the seminary, was designed and the construction overseen by John Bradshaw Gass of the firm Bradshaw Gass and Hope, Architects Engineers and Quantity Surveyors (of Bolton, London and Edinburgh at that time). JB Gass was, in fact, a Unitarian by persuasion, but had strong links with Congregationalists and Methodists through his own social involvement as a man of faith (added by M Head, former Senior Partner, retired, of Bradhsaw Gass and Hope LLP, Bolton Street, Lancashire).[ citation needed ]

Coverage
All India Radio , News on AIR
All India Radio (AIR), also known as Akashvani ( lit. 'Voice from the sky' or 'Oracle'), is India's state-owned public radio broadcaster . Founded in 1936, [2] it operates under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and is one of the two divisions of Prasar Bharati . [3] Headquartered at the Akashvani Bhavan in New Delhi, it houses the Drama Section, FM Section, and National Service. It also serves as the home of the Indian television station Doordarshan Kendra.
All India Radio is the largest radio network in the world in terms of the number of languages broadcast, the socioeconomic diversity it serves, and the scale of its broadcasting organisation. AIR's domestic service includes 420 stations nationwide, covering nearly 92% of India's geographic area and 99.19% of its population, with programming available in 23 languages and 179 dialects. [4]
A stamp commemorating Akashvani's silver jubilee
History
[ edit ]
When the Indian State Broadcasting Service (ISBS) was renamed to All India Radio, Rabindranath Tagore rechristened it Akashvani, the voice that comes over from the skies, in a poem penned for the inauguration of Kolkata 's shortwave service. [5] [6]
The term Akashvani was also used in the context of radio by M. V. Gopalaswami in 1936 when he established India’s first private radio station at his residence, ""Vittal Vihar,"" located about 200 yards from the current All India Radio station in Mysore . [7] In 1956, Akashvani was adopted as All India Radio's on-air name. With its literal meaning in Sanskrit as ""voice from the sky,"" the name was considered highly fitting for a broadcaster. The suggestion to use Akashvani came from the poet Pandit Narendra Sharma .
During the British Raj
[ edit ]
Broadcasting commenced in June 1923 during the British Raj with programmes by the Bombay Presidency Radio Club and other radio clubs. According to an agreement on 23 July 1927, the private Indian Broadcasting Company Ltd (IBC) was authorised to operate two radio stations: the Mumbai station, which began on 23 July 1927, and the Kolkata station, which followed suit on 26 August 1927. The organisation went into liquidation on 1 March 1930. The government took over broadcasting facilities and launched the Indian State Broadcasting Service (ISBS) on April 1, 1930, initially on an experimental basis for two years. It became a permanent service in May 1932 and was later renamed All India Radio on June 8, 1936. [2] The building was contracted by Sir Sobha Singh . [8]
Old Akashvani Bhawan at Sansad Marg
On 1 October 1939, the External Service began with a broadcast in Pashto . It was intended to counter radio propaganda from Germany directed at Afghanistan , Iran , and Arab nations. The Dhaka station in Eastern India, in what is now Bangladesh , opened in 1939. This station catered to and nurtured the pioneers of Bengali intellectuals. The foremost among them, Natyaguru Nurul Momen , became the trailblazer of the talk show in 1939. He wrote and directed the first modern radio play for this station in 1942.[ citation needed ]
In December 1940, the Standing Finance Committee sanctioned a sum of Rupees 9,30,000 for the establishment of a new headquarters of the All India Radio in Delhi. [9] The new “Broadcasting House” of AIR at Parliament Street in New Delhi was inaugurated in February 1943. [10] In 1956, All India Radio (AIR) was officially renamed Akashvani, and its headquarters were renamed Akashvani Bhawan. [11]
After Independence
[ edit ]
When India became independent in 1947, the All India Radio network consisted of only six stations: Delhi , Bombay , Calcutta , Madras , Lucknow , and Tiruchirappalli . The three radio stations in Lahore , Peshawar , and Dhaka remained in what eventually became Pakistan after the partition. At that time, there were approximately 250,000 radio sets in India. [12]
In August 1947, All India Radio hired its first female newsreader, Saeeda Bano , who read the news in Urdu . [13]
On October 3, 1957, the Vividh Bharati service was launched by All India Radio to compete with Radio Ceylon . Television broadcasting commenced in Delhi in 1959 under the aegis of AIR, but was split off from the radio network as Doordarshan on 1 April 1976. [14] FM broadcasting began on 23 July 1977 in Chennai , and expanded during the 1990s. [15]
Deccan Radio (Nizam Radio 1932) , the first radio station in the princely Hyderabad State (now Hyderabad ), went live on 3 February 1935. It was launched by Mir Osman Ali Khan , the seventh Nizam of Hyderabad, boasting of a transmitting power of 200 Watts . On 1 April 1950, after Operation Polo , Deccan Radio was taken over by the Indian Government, and in 1956, it was merged with All India Radio. Thereafter, it has been known as AIR-Hyderabad (100 kW).

Aurangabad is a historic city in the Maharashtra state of India . The city is a tourist hub, surrounded by many historical monuments, including the Ajanta Caves and Ellora Caves , which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites , as well as Bibi Ka Maqbara and Panchakki . The administrative headquarters of the Aurangabad Division or Marathwada region, Aurangabad, is said to be a City of Gates and the strong presence of these can be felt as one drive through the city.

Main article: History of Aurangabad
The city was founded in 1610 by Malik Ambar , the Prime Minister of Murtaza. Nizam Shah of Ahmadnagar on the site of a village called Khadki. He made it his capital and the men of his army raised their dwellings around it. Within a decade Khadki grew into a populous and imposing city. Malik Ambar died in 1626. He was succeeded by his son Fateh Khan who changed the name of Khadki to Fatehnagar. With the capture of Daulatabad in 1633, the Nizam Shahi dominions, including Fatehnagar, came under the possession of the Mughals. In 1653 when Prince Aurangzeb was appointed the viceroy of the Deccan for the second time, he made Fatehnagar his capital and called it Aurangabad .

Aurangabad Caves : Situated at a distance of 5 km, nestled amidst the hills are 12 Buddhist caves probably dating back to 3 A.D. Of particular interest are the Tantric influences evident in the iconography and architectural designs of the caves. They also offer a panoramic view of the city as well as the imposing Maqbara .
Quila-E-Ark: In 1692, Aurangzeb ordered a palace to be built and named it the Killa Arrak. The space enclosed by the Killa Arrak or citadel covered nearly the whole ground between the Mecca and Delhi gates of the city. It had four or five gateways and a nagarkhana for the musicians. The walls were battle-mented and loop-holed, and had semi-circular towers at the angles, on which guns were once mounted. The inner portion was occupied by recesses similar to those in the city walls. To the right of the entrance was a high terrace extending the whole length of the ground enclosed.
Kali Masjid, Jama Masjid : Among the mosques, the Jumma Masjid and the Kali Masjid, built by Malik Ambar, and the Shah Ganj mosque, are the most conspicuous. Malik Ambar is said to have built seven mosques which go by the general name of Kali Masjid. The Kali Masjid is in the Juna Bazar area and was erected in 1600 A. D. It is a six-pillared stone-building standing on a high plinth. The Jumma Masjid of Malik Ambar is near the Killa Arrak. It has fifty polygonal pillars arranged in five rows, connected by a system of arches, which divide the building into twenty-seven equal compartments, each covered by a domical vault of a simple but elegant design. There are nine pointed arches in front. Of these, five were erected by Malik Ambar in 1612 A.D. and the remaining four were added by Aurangzeb.
Shahganj Masjid: Occupying the great market square of Aurangabad is the large Shah Ganj mosque, one of the finest edifices of its class to be found in any part of India. It was built in about 1720 A.D. Khafi Khan , the author of Muntakhab-al Lubab , referring to Sayyad Husain Khan's viceroyalty of the Deccan (1714–1719) says ""the reservoir at Shah Ganj was begun by Sayyad Husain Ali, and although Aazu-d Daula Iraz Khan enlarged and made higher the buildings and mosques, still Sayyad Husain Ali was the originator of that extensive reservoir, which in summer when water is scarce, relieves the sufferings of the inhabitants"".
The mosque is on a raised platform, and has shops on three of the outer sides; while the fourth or the north side is open and is ascended by a flight of steps. The facade represents an arcade of five scalloped arches, constructed in the Indo-Saracenic style, and supported on stone pillars. This portion projects a little; and the interior contains twenty-four pillars, which with six pilasters in the back wall, are arranged in the form of a square. The central portion is covered with a graceful bulbous dome, having the base adorned with crisp crinkled lotus leaves tied in a neat narrow band; and the apex bears an elegant spire. Arcaded monasteries called Kham Khas form the east and the west wings, and consist of five arches on either side, constructed like the arches of the main building, but of horizontal structure. The interior is connected by horizontal arches; and the roof is formed of a series of little domes, each supported on four pillars. There are minarets at the corners of the main building, and at the end angels of the Kham Khas. The courtyard in front contains two large cisterns. The entrance is in the form of a little mosque, with a pointed arch and two minarets.
Chowk Masjid: In 1655 was Chauk Masjid built by Shayista Khan, the maternal uncle of Aurangzeb. Its front has five pointed arches, and is two arches in depth. These are connected with one another by eight pillars and corresponding pilasters, and support five domes. The central dome, with a metallic spire is lofty, while the others are concealed in the roof. The corners are decorated with minarets. The whole structure has a high basement containing chambers used for shops, which open out on the roadside. The gate has two minarets. There is a cistern in the courtyard in front of the mosque.
Pir Ismail Mausoleum: Outside the Delhi gate along the Harsul road, in a garden, is a mausoleum to Pir Ismail. Though principally in the Moghul style of architecture, it shows some features common to Pathan architecture. It is said to have been erected in memory of Pir Ismail, a tutor to Prince Aurangzeb. The garden also contains several ruined cisterns and fountains. The gate is rather imposing and has a large pointed archway, forming a sort of portico. The actual entrance is through a small arch at the further extremity. The parapet is nearly ornamented, and so is the facade, which has three small windows with pointed arches, beside recesses. Each corner of the terrace has a little tower surmounted by a bulbous dome and a spire. The mausoleum is square in plan, and has five pointed arches on each side and similar domed towers at the corners. The interior is connected by a system of arches, corresponding with those on the sides and carrying a series of little domes.
Sunehri Mahal : The Sunehri Mahal in Paharsingpura was erected by a Bundelkhand chief who accompanied Aurangzeb into the Deccan. The building is in stone and lime, and has a high plinth. It is said to have derived its name from the paintings of gold which at one time decorated it.

[ edit ]
Kolanupaka Temple was established in the 9th century. [6] [7] [8] Kalchuri ruler Shankaragana had donated 12 villages to support the temple. [9] A number of Jain antiquities have been discovered in Kulpakji. A grant mentioning a gift to a basadi during the rile of Sankaragana (9th century) has been found at Akunur. [10] Kolanupaka flourished as a Jain center during the Rashtrakutas period. [11]
In Vividha Tirtha Kalpa (14th century) of Jinaprabhasuri the sections Kulyapak Rishabhadeva Stuti and Kollapakamanikyadeva Tirthakalpa. [12] He mentions that according to legends, the Manikyasami image was originally worshipped by Mandodari, the wife of Ravana. [13] It was brought here by the ruler Sankar of Kalyana.
Over 20 Jain inscriptions have been found at Kulpak. [14] [10] A manastambha with an inscription of 1125 AD has been found mentioning ‘Jaina basadi’ and  Jain teachers of Meshapashana Gachcha of Kanurgana. [15] . Inscriptions suggest that the Kulpak was a major center of Kanur Gana of Mula Sangh [16] [17] . A 12th-century inscription found in the temple mentions Meghachadra Siddhantadeva who entered sallekhana . There is a 151-line Kannada inscription issued by Someshvara III of Western Chalukya Empire in 1125 AD. [18]
According to Śvetāmbara legends, the main temple is said to have been built by Bharat Chakravartin . Jainism was prevalent in Andhra Pradesh before the 4th century, and Kolanupaka was one of the prominent centers of Jainism from early times. [19] The temple was recently renovated [20] by employing more than 150 artisans from Rajasthan and Gujarat.
In April 2022, during renovation in Someshwara Temple near the Kulpakji, two 4 by 1.4 feet (1.22 by 0.43 m) sculpture of 'Maha Jaina Pada' (foot) of Jain Tirthankara was discovered. [21] [22]

Many statues were found while constructing the school and library in the village.

This means that spires and other architectural details are included in the official height, but not antenna masts , as it is defined by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat . Only habitable buildings are ranked, which excludes radio masts and towers , observation towers , temples , chimneys , and other tall architectural structures. [1]
The era of skyscrapers in India began with the completion of the LIC Building in Chennai in 1959. With 12 floors initially, it was the first skyscraper in the country and remained the tallest building in the country until 1961, when it was surpassed by the 25-story Usha Kiran Building in Mumbai . [2] Many taller buildings have appeared in various cities in the country ever since. Palais Royale in Mumbai had structurally topped out in 2018 as the tallest building in the country with a height of 320 meters, but the building is still under construction.

Sultanate of Golconda - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_Shahi_dynasty,"Toggle the table of contents
Sultanate of Golconda

Capital
Golconda (1519–1591) Hyderabad (1591–1687)
Common languages
The Sultanate of Golconda ( Persian : سلطنت گلکنده; Urdu : سلطنت گولکنڈه) was an early modern kingdom in southern India , ruled by the Persianate , [6] Shia Islamic Qutb Shahi dynasty [a] of Turkoman origin. [7] [8] After the decline of the Bahmani Sultanate , the Sultanate of Golconda was established in 1518 [9] by Quli Qutb Shah , as one of the five Deccan sultanates .
The kingdom extended from parts of the modern-day Indian states of Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , Odisha and Telangana . [10] The Golconda sultanate was constantly in conflict with the Adil Shahis and Nizam Shahis , which it shared borders with in the seventeenth century to the west and northwest. [11] In 1636, Mughal emperor Shah Jahan forced the Qutb Shahis to recognize Mughal suzerainty and pay periodic tributes. The dynasty came to an end in 1687 during the reign of its seventh sultan Abul Hasan Qutb Shah , when the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb arrested and jailed Abul Hasan for the rest of his life in Daulatabad , incorporating Golconda into the Mughal empire. [12] [13] [11]
The Qutb Shahis were patrons of Persianate Shia culture. [13] [14] The official and court language of the Golconda sultanate during the first 90 years of its existence (c. 1518 – 1600) was also Persian. In the early 17th century, however, the Telugu language was elevated to the status of the Persian language, while towards the end of the Qut Shahis' rule, it was the primary court language with Persian used occasionally in official documents. According to Indologist Richard Eaton, as Qutb Shahis adopted Telugu, they started seeing their polity as the Telugu-speaking state, with the elites of the sultanate viewing their rulers as ""Telugu Sultans"". [15]
History
[ edit ]
The dynasty's founder, Sultan Quli Khawas Khan Hamdani was born in Hamadan , Iran. He belonged to the Qara Qoyunlu , a Turkmen Muslim tribe and therefore a descendant of Qara Yusuf . [16] [17] In the 16th century, he migrated to Delhi with his uncle, Allah-Quli, some of his relatives and friends. Later he migrated south, to the Deccan and served the Bahmani sultan , Mahmood Shah Bahmani II , who was of Deccani Muslim ethnicity. [18] [19] He declared the independence of Golconda after the disintegration of the Bahmani Sultanate into the five Deccan sultanates . [19] He took the title Qutb Shah, and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda. He was assassinated in 1543 by his son, Jamsheed , who assumed control of the sultanate. [19] Jamsheed died in 1550 from cancer. [20] Jamsheed's young son Subhan Quli Qutb Shah reigned for a year, at which time the nobility brought back and installed Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah as sultan. [20]
Golconda, and with the construction of the Char Minar , later Hyderabad , served as capitals of the sultanate, [19] and both cities were embellished by the Qutb Shahi sultans. The dynasty ruled Golconda for 171 years, until Aurangzeb , in his campaigns in the Deccan , conquered the Sultanate of Golconda in 1687 with the completion of his siege of Golconda . [21] The sultante's last ruler, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah , was imprisoned in Daulatabad Fort , and the territory of the Golconda Sultanate was made into a Mughal imperial province, Hyderabad Subah . [22] [23]
Economy

The Golconda Sultanate was notoriously wealthy. While its primary source of revenue was a land tax, [24] the sultanate greatly profited from its monopoly on diamond production from mines in the southern districts of the kingdom. The sultanate also had control over the Krishna and Godavari deltas , giving it access to craft production in the villages of the area, where goods like textiles were produced. The town of Masulipatnam served as the Golconda Sultanate's primary seaport for the export of diamonds and textiles. The kingdom reached the peak of its financial prosperity in the 1620s and 1630s. [25] [26]
Diamonds
Main article: Golconda diamonds
Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond first discovered by the Golconda sultanate
The Golconda Sultanate was known for its diamonds which were dubbed the Golconda diamonds . These diamonds were sought after diamonds long before the Qutb Shahi dynasty came to power, and they continued to supply this demand through European traders. [27] Diamonds from mines (especially the Kollur Mine presently in Guntur district , Andhra Pradesh ) were transported to the city of Hyderabad to be cut, polished, evaluated and sold. Golconda established itself as a diamond trading centre and until the end of the 19th century, the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in the world. [28]
Cotton-weaving
[ edit ]
During the early seventeenth century, a strong cotton-weaving industry existed in the Deccan region. Large quantities of cotton cloth were produced for domestic and export consumption. High-quality plain and patterned cloth made of muslin and calico was produced. Plain cloth was available in white or brown colour, in bleached or dyed variety. This cloth was exported to Persia and European countries. The patterned cloth was made of prints which were made indigenously with indigo for blue, chay-root for red coloured prints and vegetable yellow. Patterned cloth exports were mainly to Java, Sumatra and other eastern countries. [29] Golconda had a strong trading relationship with Ayutthaya Siam. [30]
Culture
[ edit ]

The Qutb Shahis were patrons of Persianate Shia culture. [13] [14] Over the first 90 years of their rule (c. 1518 – 1600), they championed Persian culture. Their official edicts and court language were in Persian only. [15] Quli Qutb Mulk's court became a haven for Persian culture and literature. [11] In early 17th-century, with Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah (1580–1612) a change began. He began to patronize the Telugu language and culture as well. Edicts began to be issued both in Persian and Telugu. Towards the end of the dynasty, these were primarily in Telugu with a summary in Persian. As they adopted Telugu, they saw their territory as the Telugu-speaking region, states Indologist Richard Eaton, with their elites considering the rulers as ""Telugu Sultans"". [15] [31]
Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah (1580–1612) wrote poems in Dakhini Urdu, Persian and Telugu. [14] Subsequent poets and writers, however, wrote in Urdu, while using vocabulary from Persian, Hindi and Telugu languages. [14] During the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah in 1634 AD, an ancient Sanskrit text on love and sex Ratirahasya by Kokkoka was translated into Persian and named Lazzat-un-Nisa (Flavors of the Woman). [32]
Architecture
[ edit ]
The Qutb Shahi architecture was Indo-Islamic , a culmination of Indian and Persian architectural styles. [33] Their style was very similar to that of the other Deccan Sultanates . The Qutb Shahi rulers built the Char Minar . [14]

Mosque in India
This article is about a mosque in Hyderabad , India . For the Grand Mosque in Mecca , see Masjid al-Haram .
Makkah Masjid
1693; 332 years ago (1693)
Specifications
[1]
Makkah Masjid or Mecca Masjid, is a congregational mosque in Hyderabad , India . It is the largest mosque in the city, [2] and one of the largest in the country, with a capacity of 10,000 people. [3] The mosque was built during the 17th century, and is a state-protected monument . It serves as the primary mosque for the Old City of Hyderabad , [4] and is located close to the historic landmarks of Charminar , Chowmahalla Palace and Laad Bazaar .
Muhammad Qutb Shah , the sixth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty , commissioned bricks to be made from the soil brought from Mecca , the holiest site of Islam , and used them in the construction of the central arch of the mosque, thus giving the mosque its name.
In 2014, UNESCO placed the complex on its ""tentative list"" to become a World Heritage Site , with others in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there being a number of different sultanates). [5]
History
[ edit ]
The construction of Makkah Masjid began in the year 1617 CE, during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Qutb Shah , the sixth Qutb Shahi Sultan of Golconda (now Hyderabad). The ruler personally laid its foundation stone . Around 8,000 workers were employed to build the mosque. It was completed by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1693. [6] [3] The three-arched facades[ dubious – discuss ] have been carved from a single piece of granite, which took five years to quarry.
Jean-Baptiste Tavernier , a French explorer, in his travelogue observed:
It is about 50 years since they began to build a splendid pagoda in the town which will be the grandest in all India when it is completed. The size of the stone is the subject of special accomplishment, and that of a niche, which is its place for prayer, is an entire rock of such enormous size that they spent five years in quarrying it, and 500 to 600 men were employed continually on its work. It required still more time to roll it up on to conveyance by which they brought it to the pagoda; and they took 1400 oxen to draw it. [7]
Bombing

Architecture
[ edit ]
The Mecca Masjid is considered to be one of the best architectural works of the Qutb Shahis. [10] It is constructed entirely of dressed stone, rather than rubble or plaster. The mosque's prayer hall measures 69 by 55 metres (225 by 180 ft) , and has a 23-metre-high (75 ft) ceiling. The facade of the prayer hall features five open arches, and is flanked by two minarets . Each minaret is topped by a dome, and adjoined to an arcaded balcony lining either side of the prayer hall. [6]
The sahn (courtyard) of the mosque measures 108 square metres (1,160 sq ft). [4] It contains a sundial, as well as the remains of a hammam . Two minarets lie on either side of the main entrance to the mosque complex. [3]
Towards the southern end of the mosque lie the marble tombs of the Asaf Jahi rulers and family members, save the first ( Asaf Jah I ) and the last ( Asaf Jah VII ). These are housed in a rectangular, arched, and canopied building, which was added in 1914 during the rule of Mir Osman Ali Khan , the last Asaf Jahi ruler. [6] [11] [10] At both ends of this resting place for the Asaf Jahi's are two rectangular blocks with four minarets each. These minarets have elegant and circular balconies with low ornamental walls and arches. Above them is an octagonal inverted platter from which the rest of the minarets soar until arrested by a dome and a spire.[ citation needed ]

Telugu: [ˈɦaɪ̯daɾaːbaːd] ⓘ ,
Urdu: [ˈɦɛːdəɾaːbaːd] ) is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana . It occupies 650 km2 (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River , in the northern part of Southern India. With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes , including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in the north of the city centre. According to the 2011 census of India , Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7 million residents in the metropolitan region , making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India. With an output of US$ 95 billion, [6] [7] Hyderabad has the sixth-largest urban economy in India.
The Qutb Shahi dynasty's Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond the fortified Golconda . In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals . In 1724, Asaf Jah I , the Mughal viceroy , declared his sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty , also known as the Nizams . Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahis from 1769 to 1948. As the capital of the princely state of Hyderabad , the city housed the British Residency and cantonment until Indian independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian Union in 1948 and continued as a capital of Hyderabad State from 1948 to 1956. After the introduction of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 , Hyderabad was made the capital of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh . In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was split to form the state of Telangana, and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states with a transitional arrangement scheduled to end in 2024. [8] Since 1956, the city has housed the Rashtrapati Nilayam , the winter office of the president of India .
Relics of the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras remain visible today; the Charminar has come to symbolise the city. By the end of the early modern era, the Mughal Empire had declined in the Deccan, and the Nizam's patronage attracted men of letters from various parts of the world. A distinctive culture arose from the amalgamation of local and migrated artisans, with painting , handicraft , jewellery , literature , dialect and clothing prominent even today. For its cuisine , the city is listed as a creative city of gastronomy by UNESCO . The Telugu film industry based in the city is the highest-grossing film industry in India as of 2021 [update] .
Until the 19th century, Hyderabad was known for the pearl industry and was nicknamed the ""City of Pearls"", and was the only trading centre for Golconda diamonds in the world. Many of the city's historical and traditional bazaars remain open. Hyderabad's central location between the Deccan Plateau and the Western Ghats , and industrialisation throughout the 20th century attracted major Indian research, manufacturing, educational and financial institutions. Since the 1990s, the city has emerged as an Indian hub of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and information technology. The formation of the special economic zones of Hardware Park and HITEC City , dedicated to information technology, has encouraged leading multinationals to set up operations in Hyderabad.

Toponymy
The name Hyderabad means ""Haydar's City"" or ""Lion City"", from haydar 'lion' and ābād 'city', after Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib , also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battle. [9] The city was originally called Baghnagar (""city of gardens""). [10] [11] The European travellers von Poser and Thévenot found both names in use in the 17th century. [12] [13] [14] : 6 A popular legend suggests that the founder of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah , named it Bhagya-nagar (""fortunate city"") [15] after Bhagmati , a local nautch (dancing girl) whom he married. She converted to Islam and adopted the title Hyder Mahal, the city being subsequently named Hyderabad in her honour. [14] : 6 [16]
In the year 1597, Hyderabad gained the epithet Farkhunda Bunyad ( lit. 'Of Auspicious Foundation'). Following the Mughal conquest of Hyderabad , emperor Aurangzeb changed the epithet to Dar-ul-Jihad ( lit. 'Abode of Holy War'), a title which appears on coins minted in the city during the reigns of Aurangzeb and Kam Bakhsh . The later Mughal emperor Shah Alam returned the city to its older epithet of Farkhunda Bunyad, and consequently Mughal coins of Shah Alam and Muhammad Shah feature this title as the city's mint-name. [17] [18]
Early and medieval history
Telangana since 2014
The discovery of Megalithic burial sites and cairn circles in the suburbs of Hyderabad, in 1851 by Philip Meadows Taylor , a polymath in the service of the Nizam, had provided evidence that the region in which the city stands has been inhabited since the Stone Age . [19] [20] In 2008, Archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed Iron Age sites that may date from 500 BCE . [21] The region comprising modern Hyderabad and its surroundings was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty from 624 CE to 1075 CE. [22] Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century, Golconda—now part of Hyderabad—came under the control of the Kakatiya dynasty from 1158, whose seat of power was at Warangal —148 km (92 mi) northeast of modern Hyderabad. [23] The Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva (1199–1262) built a hilltop outpost —later known as Golconda Fort —to defend their western region. [20]
The Kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the Khalji dynasty in 1310 after its defeat by Sultan Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate . This lasted until 1321 when the Kakatiya dynasty was annexed by Malik Kafur , Khalji's general. [24] During this period, Khalji took the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which is said to have been mined from the Kollur Mines of Golconda, to Delhi. [25] Muhammad bin Tughluq succeeded to the Delhi sultanate in 1325, bringing Warangal under the rule of the Tughlaq dynasty ; Malik Maqbul Tilangani was appointed its governor. In 1336 the regional chieftains Musunuri Nayakas —who revolted against the Delhi sultanate in 1333—took Warangal under their direct control and declared it as their capital. [26] In 1347 when Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah , a governor under bin Tughluq, rebelled against Delhi and established the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan Plateau , with Gulbarga —200 km (124 mi) west of Hyderabad—as its capital, both the neighbouring rulers Musunuri Nayakas of Warangal and Bahmani Sultans of Gulbarga engaged in many wars until 1364–65 when a peace treaty was signed and the Musunuri Nayakas ceded Golconda Fort to the Bahmani Sultan. The Bahmani Sultans ruled the region until 1518 and were the first independent Muslim rulers of the Deccan. [27] [28] [29]

In 1496 Sultan Quli was appointed as a Bahmani governor of Telangana. He rebuilt, expanded and fortified the old mud fort of Golconda and named the city ""Muhammad Nagar"". In 1518, he revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty . [23] [30] [31] The fifth Qutb Shahi sultan, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah , established Hyderabad on the banks of the Musi River in 1591, [32] [33] to avoid water shortages experienced at Golconda. [34] During his rule, he had the Charminar and Mecca Masjid built in the city. [35] On 21 September 1687, the Golconda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after a year-long siege of the Golconda Fort. [36] [37] The annexed city ""Hyderabad"" was renamed Darul Jihad (House of War), [38] whereas the main territories of the Golconda Sultanate were incorporated into the Mughal empire as the province Hyderabad Subah . [39] Mughal rule in Hyderabad was administered by three main governors: Jan Sipar Khan (1688–1700), his son Rustam Dil Khan (1700–13) and Mubariz Khan (1713–24). [40]
Modern history
In 1713, Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar appointed Mubariz Khan as Governor of Hyderabad. During his tenure, he fortified the city and controlled the internal and neighbouring threats. [41] In 1714 Farrukhsiyar appointed Asaf Jah I as Viceroy of the Deccan —(administrator of six Mughal governorates) with the title Nizam-ul-Mulk (Administrator of the Realm). In 1721, he was appointed as Prime Minister of the Mughal Empire . [42] His differences with the court nobles led him to resign from all the imperial responsibilities in 1723 and leave for Deccan. [43] [44] Under the influence of Asaf Jah I's opponents, Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah issued a decree to Mubariz Khan , to stop Asaf Jah I which resulted in the Battle of Shakar Kheda . [43] : 93–94 In 1724, Asaf Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the Deccan , named the region Hyderabad Deccan , and started what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty . Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asaf Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad . [41] [45] The death of Asaf Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons and grandson— Nasir Jung (1748–1750), Muzaffar Jang (1750–1751) and Salabat Jung (1751–1762)—contended for the throne backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. The accession of Asaf Jah II , who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768 he signed the Treaty of Masulipatam —by which the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent, got the right to control and collect the taxes at Coromandel Coast . [46]

In 1769 Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Asaf Jahi Nizams. [41] [45] In response to regular threats from Hyder Ali (Dalwai of Mysore ), Baji Rao I ( Peshwa of the Maratha Empire ), and Basalath Jung (Asaf Jah II's elder brother, who was supported by French General the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau ), the Nizam signed a subsidiary alliance with the East India Company in 1798, allowing the British Indian Army to be stationed at Bolarum (modern Secunderabad ) to protect the state's capital, for which the Nizams paid an annual maintenance to the British. [46]
Until 1874 there were no modern industries in Hyderabad. With the introduction of railways in the 1880s, four factories were built to the south and east of Hussain Sagar lake, [47] and during the early 20th century, Hyderabad was transformed into a modern city with the establishment of transport services , underground drainage, running water, electricity , telecommunications, universities, industries, and Begumpet Airport . The Nizams ruled the princely state of Hyderabad during the British Raj . [41] [45]
Post-Independence

After India gained independence , the Nizam declared his intention to remain independent rather than become part of the Indian Union or newly formed Dominion of Pakistan . [46] The Hyderabad State Congress, with the support of the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India , began agitating against Nizam VII in 1948. On 17 September that year, the Indian Army took control of Hyderabad State after an invasion codenamed Operation Polo . With the defeat of his forces, Nizam VII capitulated to the Indian Union by signing an Instrument of Accession , which made him the Rajpramukh (Princely Governor) of the state until it was abolished on 31 October 1956. [45] [48]
Between 1946 and 1951, the Communist Party of India fomented the Telangana uprising against the feudal lords of the Telangana region . [49] The Constitution of India , which became effective on 26 January 1950, made Hyderabad State one of the part B states of India, with Hyderabad city continuing to be the capital. [50] In his 1955 report Thoughts on Linguistic States, B. R. Ambedkar , then chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution , proposed designating the city of Hyderabad as the second capital of India because of its amenities and strategic central location. [51]
On 1 November 1956 the states of India were reorganised by language. Hyderabad state was split into three parts, which were merged with neighbouring states to form Maharashtra , Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh . The nine Telugu - and Urdu -speaking districts of Hyderabad State in the Telangana region were merged with the Telugu-speaking Andhra State to create Andhra Pradesh, [52] [53] [54] with Hyderabad as its capital. Several protests, known collectively as the Telangana movement , attempted to invalidate the merger and demanded the creation of a new Telangana state. Major actions took place in 1969 and 1972, and a third began in 2010. [55] On 30 July 2013 the government of India declared that part of Andhra Pradesh would be split off to form a new Telangana state and that Hyderabad city would be the capital city and part of Telangana, while the city would also remain the capital of Andhra Pradesh for no more than ten years. On 3 October 2013 the Union Cabinet approved the proposal, [56] and in February 2014 both houses of Parliament passed the Telangana Bill . With the final assent of the President of India, Telangana state was formed on 2 June 2014.

A satellite view of Hyderabad captured by Sentinel-2A , the yellow and brown colours feature the city core, the light green shows arid fields and the dark green depicts vegetation. The Musi River and its adjacent small water bodies are highlighted with a blue colour. [57]
Hyderabad is 1,566 km (973 mi) south of Delhi , 699 km (434 mi) southeast of Mumbai , and 570 km (350 mi) north of Bangalore by road. [58] It is situated in the southern part of Telangana in southeastern India, [59] along the banks of the Musi River , a tributary of Krishna River located on the Deccan Plateau in the northern part of South India. [60] [61] [62] Greater Hyderabad covers 650 km2 (250 sq mi), making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in India. [63] With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), Hyderabad lies on predominantly sloping terrain of grey and pink granite , dotted with small hills, the highest being Banjara Hills at 672 m (2,205 ft). [62] [64] The city has numerous lakes sometime referred to as sagar, meaning ""sea"". Examples include artificial lakes created by dams on the Musi, such as Hussain Sagar (built-in 1562 near the city centre), Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar . [62] [65] As of 1996 [update] , the city had 140 lakes and 834 water tanks (ponds). [66]
Climate
Hyderabad has a tropical wet and dry climate ( Köppen Aw) bordering on a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh). [67] The annual mean temperature is 26.6 °C (79.9 °F); monthly mean temperatures are 21–33 °C (70–91 °F). [68] Summers (March–June) are hot and dry, with average highs in the mid-to-high 30s Celsius; [69] maximum temperatures often exceed 40 °C (104 °F) between April and June. [68] The coolest temperatures occur in December and January when the lowest temperature occasionally dips to 10 °C (50 °F). [68] May is the hottest month when daily temperatures range from 26–39 °C (79–102 °F); December, the coldest, has temperatures varying from 14.5–28 °C (58.1–82.4 °F). [69]
Heavy rain from the south-west summer monsoon falls between June and October, supplying Hyderabad with most of its mean annual rainfall. [69] Since records began in November 1891, the heaviest rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period was 241.5 mm (10 in) on 24 August 2000. The highest temperature ever recorded was 45.5 °C (114 °F) on 2 June 1966, and the lowest was 6.1 °C (43 °F) on 8 January 1946. [70] The city receives 2,731 hours of sunshine per year; maximum daily sunlight exposure occurs in February. [71]

Hyderabad's lakes and the sloping terrain of its low-lying hills provide habitat for an assortment of flora and fauna. As of 2016 [update] , the tree cover is 1.7% of the total city area, a decrease from 2.7% in 1996. [80] The forest region in and around the city encompasses areas of ecological and biological importance, which are preserved in the form of national parks , zoos , mini-zoos and a wildlife sanctuary . Nehru Zoological Park , the city's largest zoo, is the first in India to have a lion and tiger safari park . Hyderabad has three national parks ( Mrugavani National Park , Mahavir Harina Vanasthali National Park and Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park ), and the Manjira Wildlife Sanctuary is about 50 km (31 mi) from the city.
Telangana Legislature

The GHMC is divided into six municipal zones
The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) oversees the civic infrastructure of the city, there are six administrative zones of GHMC: South Zone–( Charminar ), East Zone–( L. B. Nagar ), West Zone–( Serilingampally ), North Zone–( Kukatpally ), Northeast Zone–( Secunderabad ) and Central Zone–( Khairatabad ); these zones consist of 30 ""circles"", which together encompass 150 municipal wards . Each ward is represented by a corporator , elected by popular vote, as of 2020 [update] the city has 7,400,000 voters of which 3,850,000 are male and 3,500,000 are female. [84] The corporators elect the Mayor , who is the titular head of GHMC; executive powers rest with the Municipal Commissioner, appointed by the state government. The GHMC carries out the city's infrastructural work such as building and maintenance of roads and drains, town planning including construction regulation, maintenance of municipal markets and parks, solid waste management, the issuing of birth and death certificates, the issuing of trade licences, collection of property tax, and community welfare services such as mother and child healthcare, and pre-school and non-formal education. [85] The GHMC was formed in April 2007 by merging the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) with 12 municipalities of the Hyderabad , Ranga Reddy and Medak districts covering a total area of 650 km2 (250 sq mi). [63] : 3 The Secunderabad Cantonment Board is a civic administration agency overseeing an area of 40.1 km2 (15.5 sq mi), [86] : 93 where there are several military camps. [87] : 2 [88] The Osmania University campus is administered independently by the university authority. [86] : 93 Appointed in February 2021, Gadwal Vijayalakshmi of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is serving as the mayor of GHMC. [89]
In Hyderabad police jurisdiction is divided into three commissionerates: Hyderabad (established in 1847 AD, the oldest police commissionerate in India ), Cyberabad , and Rachakonda , each headed by a commissioner of police , who are Indian Police Service (IPS) officers. The Hyderabad police is a division of the Telangana Police , under the state Home Ministry. [90] [91]
The jurisdictions of the city's administrative agencies are, in ascending order of size: the Hyderabad Police area, Hyderabad district, the GHMC area (""Hyderabad city""), and the area under the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA). The HMDA is an apolitical urban planning agency that covers the GHMC and its suburbs, extending to 54 mandals in five districts encircling the city. It coordinates the development activities of GHMC and suburban municipalities and manages the administration of bodies such as the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB). [92]
Hyderabad is the seat of the Government of Telangana , Government of Andhra Pradesh and the President of India's winter retreat Rashtrapati Nilayam , as well as the Telangana High Court and various local government agencies. The Lower City Civil Court and the Metropolitan Criminal Court are under the jurisdiction of the High Court. [93] [94] [95] : 1 The GHMC area contains 24 State Legislative Assembly constituencies, [96] [97] which form five constituencies of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Parliament of India). [98]
Utility services

The HMWSSB (Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewage Board) regulates rainwater harvesting , sewerage services, and water supply. In 2005, the HMWSSB started operating a 116 km-long (72 mi) water supply pipeline from Nagarjuna Sagar Dam to meet increasing demand. [99] [100] The Telangana Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSPDCL) manages electricity supply. [101] As of 2014 [update] , there were 15 fire stations in the city, operated by the Telangana State Disaster and Fire Response Department. [102] The government-owned India Post has five head post offices and many sub-post offices in Hyderabad, which are complemented by private courier services. [62]
Pollution control
Hyderabad produces around 4,500 tonnes of solid waste daily, which is transported from collection units in Imlibun , Yousufguda and Lower Tank Bund to the dumpsite in Jawaharnagar . [103] Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. [104] Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has led to increased industrial waste , air , noise and water pollution , which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). [105] [106] The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% from a combination of vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. [107] Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. [108] [109] [110] The city's ""VIP areas"", the Assembly building, Secretariat, and Telangana chief minister's office, have particularly low air quality index ratings, suffering from high levels of PM2.5 's. [111] Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, [112] is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels. [113] [114] This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated affluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city. [115]
Healthcare

The Commissionerate of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for planning, implementation and monitoring of all facilities related to health and preventive services. [116] [117] As of 2010 [update] –11, the city had 50 government hospitals, [118] 300 private and charity hospitals and 194 nursing homes providing around 12,000 hospital beds, fewer than half the required 25,000. [119] For every 10,000 people in the city, there are 17.6 hospital beds, [120] 9 specialist doctors, 14 nurses and 6 physicians. [119] The city has about 4,000 individual clinics. [121] Private clinics are preferred by many residents because of the distance to, poor quality of care at and long waiting times in government facilities, [122] : 60–61 despite the high proportion of the city's residents being covered by government health insurance: 24% according to a National Family Health Survey in 2005. [122] : 41 As of 2012 [update] , many new private hospitals of various sizes were opened or being built. [121] Hyderabad has outpatient and inpatient facilities that use Unani , homoeopathic and Ayurvedic treatments. [123]
In the 2005 National Family Health Survey, it was reported that the city's total fertility rate is 1.8, [122] : 47 which is below the replacement rate . Only 61% of children had been provided with all basic vaccines ( BCG , measles and full courses of polio and DPT ), fewer than in all other surveyed cities except Meerut . [122] : 98 The infant mortality rate was 35 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate for children under five was 41 per 1,000 live births. [122] : 97 The survey also reported that a third of women and a quarter of men are overweight or obese, 49% of children below 5 years are anaemic , and up to 20% of children are underweight, [122] : 44, 55–56 while more than 2% of women and 3% of men suffer from diabetes .

When the GHMC was created in 2007, the area occupied by the municipality increased from 175 km2 (68 sq mi) to 650 km2 (250 sq mi). [63] [126] Consequently, the population increased by 87%, from 3,637,483 as of 2001 [update] census to 6,809,970 as of 2011 [update] census, 24% of which are migrants from elsewhere in India, [87] : 2 making Hyderabad the nation's fourth most populous city . [1] [3] As of 2011 [update] , the population density is 18,480/km2 (47,900/sq mi) [127] and the Hyderabad urban agglomeration had a population of 7,749,334 making it the sixth most populous urban agglomeration in the country. [3] as of 2011 [update] census , there are 3,500,802 male and 3,309,168 female citizens—a sex ratio of 945 females per 1000 males, higher than the national average of 926 per 1000.

[128] [130] The socio-economic strata consist of 20% upper class , 50% middle class and 30% working class . [131]
Ethnicity
Referred to as ""Hyderabadi"", the residents of Hyderabad are predominantly Telugu and Urdu speaking people, with minority Arab, Marathi , Marwari , and Pathan communities. [132]
Hyderabadi Muslims are a unique community who owe much of their history, language, cuisine, and culture to Hyderabad, and the various dynasties who previously ruled. [133] [134] Hadhrami Arabs , African Arabs , Armenians , Abyssinians , Iranians , Pathans and Turkish people were present before 1948; these communities, of which the Hadhrami Arabs are the largest, declined after Hyderabad State became part of the Indian Union, as they lost the patronage of the Asaf Jahi Nizams.

Slums
As of 2012, in the greater metropolitan area, 13% of the population live below the poverty line . [145] According to a 2012 report submitted by GHMC to the World Bank , Hyderabad has 1,476 slums with a total population of 1.7 million, of whom 66% live in 985 slums in the ""core"" of the city (the part that formed Hyderabad before the April 2007 expansion) and the remaining 34% live in 491 suburban tenements. [146] About 22% of the slum-dwelling households had migrated from different parts of India in the last decade of the 20th century, and 63% claimed to have lived in the slums for more than 10 years. [87] : 55 Overall literacy in the slums is 60–80% and female literacy is 52–73%. A third of the slums have basic service connections, and the remainder depend on general public services provided by the government. There are 405 government schools, 267 government-aided schools, 175 private schools, and 528 community halls in the slum areas. [147] : 70 According to a 2008 survey by the Centre for Good Governance, 87.6% of the slum-dwelling households are nuclear families , 18% are very poor, with an income up to ₹20,000 (US$230) per annum, 73% live below the poverty line (a standard poverty line recognised by the Andhra Pradesh Government is ₹24,000 (US$280) per annum), 27% of the chief wage earners (CWE) are casual labour and 38% of the CWE are illiterate. About 3.7% of the slum children aged 5–14 do not go to school and 3.2% work as child labour , of whom 64% are boys and 36% are girls.

The historic city established by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah on the southern side of the Musi River forms the heritage region of Hyderabad called the Purana Shahar (Old City), while the ""New City"" encompasses the urbanised area on the northern banks. The two are connected by many bridges across the river, the oldest of which is Purana Pul —(""old bridge"") built in 1578 AD. [148] Hyderabad is twinned with neighbouring Secunderabad , to which it is connected by Hussain Sagar . [149]
North of central Hyderabad lies Hussain Sagar, Tank Bund Road , Rani Gunj and the Secunderabad railway station . [149] Most of the city's parks and recreational centres, such as Sanjeevaiah Park , Indira Park , Lumbini Park , NTR Gardens , the Buddha statue and Tankbund Park are located here. [152] In the northwest part of the city there are upscale residential and commercial areas such as Banjara Hills , Jubilee Hills , Begumpet , Khairtabad , Tolichowki , Jagannath Temple and Miyapur . [153] The northern end contains industrial areas such as Kukatpally , Sanathnagar , Moosapet , Balanagar , Patancheru and Chanda Nagar . The northeast end is dotted with residential areas such as Malkajgiri , Neredmet , A. S. Rao Nagar and Uppal . [149] [150] [151] In the eastern part of the city lie many defence research centres and Ramoji Film City . The ""Cyberabad"" area in the southwest and west of the city, consisting of Madhapur and Gachibowli has grown rapidly since the 1990s. It is home to information technology and bio-pharmaceutical companies and to landmarks such as Hyderabad Airport, Osman Sagar , Himayath Sagar and Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park . [154] [155]
Landmarks
Heritage buildings constructed during the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras showcase Indo-Islamic architecture influenced by Medieval , Mughal and European styles. [10] [156] After the 1908 flooding of the Musi River , the city was expanded and civic monuments constructed, particularly during the rule of Mir Osman Ali Khan (the VIIth Nizam), whose patronage of architecture led to him being referred to as the maker of modern Hyderabad. [157] [158] In 2012, the government of India declared Hyderabad the first ""Best heritage city of India"". [159]
Qutb Shahi architecture of the 16th and early 17th centuries followed classical Persian architecture featuring domes and colossal arches. [160] The oldest surviving Qutb Shahi structure in Hyderabad is the ruins of the Golconda Fort built in the 16th century. Most of the historical bazaars that still exist were constructed on the street north of Charminar towards the fort. The Charminar has become an icon of the city; located in the centre of old Hyderabad, it is a square structure with sides 20 m (66 ft) long and four grand arches each facing a road. At each corner stands a 56 m (184 ft)-high minaret. The Charminar, Golconda Fort and the Qutb Shahi tombs are considered to be monuments of national importance in India ; in 2010 the Indian government proposed that the sites be listed for UNESCO World Heritage status . [157] [161] [162] : 11–18 [163]
Among the oldest surviving examples of Nizam architecture in Hyderabad is the Chowmahalla Palace , which was the seat of royal power . It showcases a diverse array of architectural styles, from the Baroque Harem to its Neoclassical royal court. The other palaces include Falaknuma Palace (inspired by the style of Andrea Palladio ), Purani Haveli , King Kothi Palace and Bella Vista Palace all of which were built at the peak of Nizam rule in the 19th century. During Mir Osman Ali Khan's rule, European styles, along with Indo-Islamic, became prominent. These styles are reflected in the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture seen in many civic monuments such as the Hyderabad High Court , Osmania Hospital , City College and the Kacheguda railway station , all designed by Vincent Esch . [164] Other landmark structures of the city constructed during his regin are the State Central Library , the Telangana Legislature, the State Archaeology Museum , Jubilee Hall , and Hyderabad railway station . [157] [160] [165] [166] Other landmarks of note are Paigah Palace , Asman Garh Palace , Basheer Bagh Palace , Errum Manzil and the Spanish Mosque , all constructed by the Paigah family . [162] : 16–17 [167] [168]

Recent estimates of the economy of Hyderabad's metropolitan area have ranged from US$40-US$74 billion ( PPP GDP ), and have ranked it either fifth- or sixth- most productive metro area of India . [169] Hyderabad is the largest contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP), tax and other revenues, of Telangana, and the sixth largest deposit centre and fourth largest credit centre nationwide, as ranked by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in June 2012. [170] Its per capita annual income in 2011 was ₹44,300 (US$510). [171] As of 2006 [update] , the largest employers in the city were the state government (113,098 employees) and central government (85,155). [172] According to a 2005 survey, 77% of males and 19% of females in the city were employed. [173] The service industry remains dominant in the city, and 90% of the employed workforce is engaged in this sector. [174]
Hyderabad's role in the pearl trade has given it the name "" City of Pearls "" and up until the 18th century, the city was the only global trading centre for diamonds known as Golconda diamonds . [37] [175] [176] Industrialisation began under the Nizams in the late 19th century, helped by railway expansion that connected the city with major ports. [177] [178] From the 1950s to the 1970s, Indian enterprises, such as Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), Bharat Electronics (BEL), Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) and Andhra Bank (AB) [150] were established in the city. [179] The city is home to Hyderabad Securities formerly known as Hyderabad Stock Exchange (HSE), [180] and houses the regional office of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). [181] In 2013, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) facility in Hyderabad was forecast to provide operations and transactions services to BSE- Mumbai by the end of 2014. [182] The growth of the financial services sector has helped Hyderabad evolve from a traditional manufacturing city to a cosmopolitan industrial service centre. [150] Since the 1990s, the growth of information technology (IT), IT-enabled services (ITES), insurance and financial institutions has expanded the service sector, and these primary economic activities have boosted the ancillary sectors of trade and commerce, transport, storage, communication, real estate and retail. [178] As of 2021 [update] , the IT exports from Hyderabad were ₹ 1,45,522 crore (US$19.66 billion), the city houses 1500 IT and TES companies that provide 628,615 jobs. [183]
Hyderabad's commercial markets are divided into four sectors: central business districts, [184] sub-central business centres, neighbourhood business centres and local business centres. [185] Many traditional and historic bazaars are located throughout the city, Laad Bazaar being the prominent among all is popular for selling a variety of traditional and cultural antique wares, along with gems and pearls. [186] [187]

The establishment of Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL), a public sector undertaking, in 1961 was followed over the decades by many national and global companies opening manufacturing and research facilities in the city. [188] As of 2010 [update] , the city manufactured one third of India's bulk drugs and 16% of biotechnology products, [189] [190] contributing to its reputation as ""India's pharmaceutical capital"" and the "" Genome Valley of India"". [191] Hyderabad is a global centre of information technology, for which it is known as Cyberabad (Cyber City). [154] [155] As of 2013 [update] , it contributed 15% of India's and 98% of Andhra Pradesh's exports in IT and ITES sectors [192] and 22% of NASSCOM 's total membership is from the city. [171] The development of HITEC City , a township with extensive technological infrastructure, prompted multinational companies to establish facilities in Hyderabad. [154] The city is home to more than 1300 IT and ITES firms that provide employment for 407,000 individuals; the global conglomerates include Microsoft , Apple , Amazon , Google , IBM , Yahoo! , Oracle Corporation , Dell , Facebook , CISCO , [87] : 3 [193] and major Indian firms including Tech Mahindra , Infosys , Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Polaris, Cyient and Wipro . [87] : 3 In 2009 the World Bank Group ranked the city as the second best Indian city for doing business . [194] The city and its suburbs contain the highest number of special economic zones of any Indian city. [171]
The Automotive industry in Hyderabad is also emerging and making it an automobile hub. [195] Automobile companies including as Hyundai , Hyderabad Allwyn , Praga Tools , HMT Bearings , Ordnance Factory Medak , Deccan Auto and Mahindra & Mahindra have units in the Hyderabad economic zone. [196] Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , Maruti Suzuki and Triton Energy will invest in Hyderabad. [197]
Like the rest of India, Hyderabad has a large informal economy that employs 30% of the labour force. [147] : 71 According to a survey published in 2007, it had 40–50,000 street vendors , and their numbers were increasing. [198] : 9 Among the street vendors, 84% are male and 16% female, [199] : 12 and four fifths are ""stationary vendors"" operating from a fixed pitch, often with their own stall . [199] : 15–16 Most are financed through personal savings; only 8% borrow from moneylenders. [199] : 19 Vendor earnings vary from ₹50 (58¢ US) to ₹800 (US$9.20) per day. [198] : 25 Other unorganised economic sectors include dairy, poultry farming, brick manufacturing, casual labour and domestic help. Those involved in the informal economy constitute a major portion of the urban poor. [147] : 71 [200]
In 2024, the World Economic Forum established a Centre for Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR), in the city. Which it describes as a hub to leverage the latest technology in advancing the life sciences and health sectors. [201]
Culture

Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire . After the fall of Delhi in 1857 , the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the Indian subcontinent , under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu. [202] [203] This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages, cultures and religions, which has since led to a co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions , for which the city has become noted. [204] [205] : viii A further consequence of this north–south mix is that both Telugu and Urdu are official languages of Telangana. [206] The mixing of religions has resulted in many festivals being celebrated in Hyderabad such as Ganesh Chaturthi , Diwali and Bonalu of Hindu tradition and Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha by Muslims. [207]
Traditional Hyderabadi garb reveals a mix of Muslim and Hindu influences with men wearing sherwani and kurta – paijama and women wearing khara dupatta and salwar kameez . [208] [209] [210] Most Muslim women wear burqa and hijab outdoors. [211] In addition to the traditional Hindu and Muslim garments, increasing exposure to western cultures has led to a rise in the wearing of western style clothing among youths. [212]
Literature
In the past, Qutb Shahi rulers and Asaf Jahi Nizams attracted artists, architects, and men of letters from different parts of the world through patronage. The resulting ethnic mix popularised cultural events such as mushairas (poetic symposia), Qawwali (devotional songs) and Dholak ke Geet (traditional folk songs). [213] [214] [215] The Qutb Shahi dynasty particularly encouraged the growth of Deccani literature leading to works such as the Deccani Masnavi and Diwan poetry , which are among the earliest available manuscripts in Urdu. [216] Lazzat Un Nisa , a book compiled in the 15th century at Qutb Shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret medicines and stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual arts. [217] The reign of the Asaf Jahi Nizams saw many literary reforms and the introduction of Urdu as a language of court, administration and education. [218] In 1824, a collection of Urdu Ghazal poetry, named Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa, authored by Mah Laqa Bai —the first female Urdu poet to produce a Diwan—was published in Hyderabad. [219] Hyderabad has continued with these traditions in its annual Hyderabad Literary Festival , held since 2010, showcasing the city's literary and cultural creativity. [220] Organisations engaged in the advancement of literature include the Sahitya Akademi , the Urdu Academy, the Telugu Academy, the National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language , the Comparative Literature Association of India, and the Andhra Saraswata Parishad. Literary development is further aided by state institutions such as the State Central Library, the largest public library in the state which was established in 1891, [221] and other major libraries including the Sri Krishna Devaraya Andhra Bhasha Nilayam , the British Library and the Sundarayya Vignana Kendram . [222]

Music and films

South Indian music and dances such as the Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam styles are popular in the Deccan region. As a result of their cultural policies, North Indian music and dance gained popularity during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams, [223] and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif (courtesans). These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture and were appointed to teach singing, poetry, and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy. [224] This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based marfa music , Dholak ke Geet (household songs based on local folklore ), and qawwali , especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events. [225] [226] The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music. [227]
Although the city is not particularly noted for theatre and drama, [228] the state government promotes theatre with multiple programmes and festivals [229] [230] in such venues as the Ravindra Bharathi , Shilpakala Vedika , Lalithakala Thoranam and Lamakaan . Although not a purely music-oriented event, Numaish , a popular annual exhibition of local and national consumer products, does feature some musical performances. [231]
The city is home to the Telugu film industry, popularly known as Tollywood —as of 2021 [update] it is the highest-grossing Indian film industry . [232] In the 1970s, Deccani language realist films by globally acclaimed Shyam Benegal started a movement of coming of age art films in India, which came to be known as parallel cinema . [233] The Deccani film industry (""Dollywood"") produces films in the local Hyderabadi dialect, which have gained regional popularity since 2005. [234] The city has hosted international film festivals such as the International Children's Film Festival and the Hyderabad International Film Festival . [235] In 2005, Guinness World Records declared Ramoji Film City to be the world's largest film studio. [236]
Art and handicrafts
An 18th century Bidriware, water pipe base of Hookah , displayed at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art
The region is well known for its Golconda and Hyderabad painting styles which are branches of Deccan painting . [237] Developed during the 16th century, the Golconda style is a native style blending foreign techniques and bears some similarity to the Vijayanagara paintings of neighbouring Mysore. A significant use of luminous gold and white colours is generally found in the Golconda style. [238] The Hyderabad style originated in the 17th century under the Nizams. Highly influenced by Mughal painting , this style makes use of bright colours and mostly depicts regional landscape, culture, costumes, and jewellery. [237]
Although not a centre for handicrafts itself, the patronage of the arts by the Mughals and Nizams attracted artisans from the region to Hyderabad. Such crafts include: Wootz steel , Filigree work , Bidriware , a metalwork handicraft from neighbouring Karnataka , which was popularised during the 18th century and has since been granted a Geographical Indication (GI) tag under the auspices of the WTO act; [157] [239] and Zari and Zardozi , embroidery works on textile that involve making elaborate designs using gold, silver and other metal threads. [240] Chintz —a glazed calico textiles was originated in Golconda in 16th century. [241] [242] and another example of a handicraft drawn to Hyderabad is Kalamkari , a hand-painted or block-printed cotton textile that comes from cities in Andhra Pradesh. This craft is distinguished in having both a Hindu style, known as Srikalahasti and entirely done by hand, and an Islamic style, known as Machilipatnam which uses both hand and block techniques. [243] Examples of Hyderabad's arts and crafts are housed in various museums including the Salar Jung Museum (housing ""one of the largest one-man-collections in the world"" [244] ), the Telangana State Archaeology Museum , the Nizam Museum , the City Museum and the Birla Science Museum .

Prataparudra - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prataparudra_II,"Maharaja of the Kakatiya Kingdom from 1289 to 1323
Prataparudra
Mother
Mummadamma
Pratāparudra (r. c. 1289–1323) was the last monarch of the Kakatiya dynasty of India. He ruled the eastern part of Deccan , with his capital at Warangal .
Prataparudra succeeded his grandmother Rudrama as the Kakatiya monarch. In the first half of his reign, he subjugated the insubordinate chiefs who had asserted their independence during his grandmother's reign. He also achieved successes against the neighbouring kingdoms of the Yadavas (Seunas) , the Pandyas and Kampili .
In 1310, he faced an invasion from the Delhi Sultanate , and agreed to become a tributary of the Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khalji . After Alauddin's death, he stopped making tribute payments, but a 1318 invasion forced him to pay tribute to Alauddin's son Mubarak Shah . After the end of the Khalji dynasty, he again withheld the tribute payments to Delhi. This prompted the new Sultan Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq to order a 1323 invasion that ended the Kakatiya dynasty and resulted in the annexation of their kingdom to the Delhi Sultanate.
Early life
[ edit ]
According to Telugu-rajula-charitramu, Prataparudra was born in the Shaka year 1166 (1244 CE); this may be a mistake for Shaka 1176 (1254 CE). The earliest record to mention him is his grandmother Rudrama 's 1261 CE Malkapuram inscription. [1]
His mother Mummadamma was the eldest daughter of Rudrama and the Chalukya prince Virabhadra. His father Mahadeva was a Kakatiya prince. Prataparudra succeeded Rudramadevi on the Kakatiya throne. [2]
Earlier historians believed that Rudramadevi ruled until 1295, because some records before this year name Prataparudra as Kumara-Rudra (Prince Rudra). [3] However, a later inscription discovered at Chandupatla confirms that Rudramadevi died some days before 27 November 1289, the date of the inscription. [4] [5] Moreover, some records before 1295 (such as the 1292 Inkirala inscription) call Prataparudra a Maharaja . It appears that Prataparudra continued to be called Kumara-Rudra for some years after ascending the throne, because this was a familiar usage. [3] Prataparudra’s chief queen was Visalakshi; Pratapa-charitra, a late legendary account of the Kakatiya kings refers twice to this queen. [6] Lakshmidevi was another queen of this king mentioned in an inscription found in the village Yelgedu in the present-day Karimnagar district. [6]
Prataparudra had been associated with his grandmother's military campaigns and administration, which helped him gain the acceptance of the nobles after ascending the throne. [7]
Subjugation of Ambadeva and his allies
[ edit ]
During the reign of Prataparudra's predecessor Rudramadevi, Ambadeva – a Kayastha feudatory of the Kakatiyas – had set up an independent kingdom with support from the neighbouring Yadava (Seuna) and Pandya dynasties. [8] Soon after ascending the throne, Prataparudra reorganized the Kakatiya military, and launched expeditions against Ambadeva and his allies. [9]
Prataparudra first sent his army to Vikramasimhapura (modern Nellore ), which was ruled by Ambadeva's appointee Manuma Gandagopala. The attack was led by Adidamu Mallu, an officer (dakshinabhuja-danda) of the  Kakatiya commander-in-chief (sakala-senadhipati) Somayadula Rudradeva. Manuma was defeated and killed in battle. He was succeeded by Madhurantaka Pottapi Choda Ranganatha (alias Raja-Gandagopala), whose rule is attested by inscriptions dated to 1290 ( Shaka 1212). Prataparudra formed an alliance with Raja-Gandagopala. [10]
In 1291–92 (Shaka 1213), Prataparudra sent an army to Tripurantakam . The army was led by Manuma Gannaya (son of Kolani Soma-mantri), and Annayadeva (Prataparudra's cousin and son of Induluri Peda Gannaya-mantri). Epigraphic evidence suggests that as a result of this attack, Ambadeva had to retreat southwards to the Mulikinadu region: his last inscription at Tripurantakam is dated Shaka 1213, and an inscription of Induluri Annayadeva is dated two months later in the same year. [10] The Kayasthas seem to have ruled Mulikanadu independently for the next few years, as the inscriptions of Ambadeva's son Tripurari II do not mention Prataparudra as his overlord. In 1309, Prataparudra sent an expedition to Mulikinadu, which resulted in the end of the Kayastha rule. The region was annexed to the Kakatiya kingdom, and Somaya Nayaka was made its governor. [7]
Prataparudra also sent an expedition against the Yadavas (Seunas), who had supported Ambadeva. The Telugu Chola Manuma Gandagopala (not to be confused with Manuma Gandagopala of Nellore) participated in this expedition. His Narasaraopet inscription calls him ""the wild fire to the bamboo-like army of the Seunas"". The 1294 Raichur Fort inscription of the Kakatiya feudatory Gona Vithala states that Vithala captured the Adavani and Tumbala forts in the present-day Bellary district , and Manuva and Haluva in the Raichur Doab . Finally, he took control of the city of Raichur, where he erected strong fortifications to protect the city. [11]
Meanwhile, Raja-Gandagopala betrayed Prataparudra, and formed an alliance with the Pandyas. [10] To punish him, Prataparudra sent a second expedition to Nellore, led by the Telugu Chola chief Manuma Gandagopala. The Kakatiya army won the ensuing battle: a 1297–98 (Shaka 1219) inscription of Manuma states that he drank ""the ocean of the Dravida (Pandya) army"" like a massive fire. [11]
Alauddin Khalji's invasion
Main article: Siege of Warangal (1310)
In the early 13th century, the Deccan region was an immensely wealthy area, having been shielded from the foreign Muslim armies that had ransacked and razed northern India. [12] In 1296, Alauddin Khalji , a general of the Delhi Sultanate , had successfully raided Devagiri , the capital of the Yadavas , who were the western neighbours of the Kakatiyas. Alauddin forced the Yadava monarch Ramachandra to become his tributary, and shortly after, used the war booty from Devagiri to usurp the throne of Delhi. The huge plunder obtained from Devagiri prompted Alauddin to plan an invasion of the Kakatiya capital Warangal in 1301, but the untimely death of his general Ulugh Khan made him defer this plan. [13]
In late 1302 or early 1303, Alauddin sent his generals Malik Juna and Malik Chajju on an invasion of Warangal. By the time the Khalji army returned to Delhi, it had suffered severe losses in men and material. [13] The Delhi Sultanate chronicles do not mention how and where the army suffered these losses. According to the 14th century chronicler Ziauddin Barani , the army had managed to reach Warangal, but decided to return because the rainy season had started. [14] The 16th century chronicler Firishta states that this army was ordered to reach Warangal via Bengal . Historian Kishori Saran Lal theorizes that Delhi met with a humiliating defeat in Bengal, [15] which was ruled by Shamsuddin Firoz ; [14] an embarrassed Alauddin decided to keep this failure a secret, which explains Barani's narrative. [14] On the other hand, P. V. P. Sastry believes that a Kakatiya army repulsed the invaders at Upparapalli. His theory is based on Velugoṭivāri-Vamṣavāli, which states that two Kakatiya commanders — the Velama chief Vena and Potugamti Maili — destroyed the pride of the Turushkas (Turkics, that is, the Khaljis). [16]
Around 1308, Alauddin sent his general Malik Kafur to invade Devagiri, after Ramachandra discontinued the tribute payments promised in 1296. Malik Kafur returned to Delhi after defeating the Yadavas , and forcing Ramachandra to become Alauddin's vassal. Prataparudra determined that the Delhi Sultanate forces were likely to invade Deccan again, and therefore, he reorganized his defence set-up. He is said to have raised an army of 900,000 archers, 20,000 horses and 100 elephants. Despite these preparations, when Malik Kafur invaded Warangal in 1310, Prataparudra was forced to negotiate a truce. He surrendered a substantial amount of wealth to the invaders, and agreed to become a tributary to Alauddin. Subsequently, he maintained friendly relations with Alauddin. [16]
Southern campaigns
[ edit ]
Taking advantage of the Khalji invasion, the Kakatiya vassals at the frontier provinces asserted independence. [16] When Mallideva, the Vaidumba chief of Gandikota, attempted to overthrow his suzerainty, Prataparudra sent his general Juttaya Lemka Gomkya Reddi to Gandikota. Reddi defeated Mallideva, and was appointed governor of Gandikota and its surrounding areas. [17]
Another insubordinate chief was Ranganatha, the Telugu Chola ruler of Nellore . In 1311, Prataparudra's overlord Alauddin asked him to contribute forces to Malik Kafur's invasion of the Pandya kingdom . On his way to the Pandya territory, Prataparudra visited Ranganatha's territory, and suppressed the rebellion. [17]
By the mid-1310s, the Pandya kingdom had been weakened by a war of succession between the brothers Sundara Pandya and Vira Pandya, and the Muslim raids. After Alauddin's death in 1316, the Hoysala king Ballala launched a fresh invasion of the Pandya territory. According to a Daksharama inscription, the Kakatiya commander Peda Rudra defeated Ballala and his allies — Shambhuvaraya of Padaividu and Yadavaraya of Chandragiri. After this victory, he occupied Kanchi in the Pandya territory. [17]
When the Pandya forces tried to evict the Kakatiyas from Kanchi, Prataparudra himself led an army against them, supported by his generals Muppidinayaka, Recherla Era Dacha, Manavira, and Devarinayaka. The Pandyas were forced to retreat after a battle near Kanchi. [17] The Kakatiya general Devarinayaka penetrated further into the Pandya territory, and defeated Vira Pandya and his ally Malayala Tiruvadi Ravivarman Kulashekhara. [18] The Kakatiyas then reinstated Sundara Pandya at Viradhavala. To commemorate his victory, Devarinayaka granted the Salakalavidu village to Sriranganatha in 1317. [19]
Mubarak Shah's invasion
Main article: Siege of Warangal, 1318
After Alauddin's death, Malik Kafur installed Alauddin's minor son Shihab-ud-din Omar as a puppet monarch on the throne of Delhi. However, Alauddin's elder son Qutubuddin Mubarak Shah soon killed Kafur, and became the Sultan. By this time, Ramachandra's son-in-law Harapaladeva had rebelled at Devagiri, and Prataparudra had stopped sending tribute payments to the Khaljis. Mubarak Shah suppressed the rebellion at Devagiri, and then sent his general Khusrau Khan to Warangal in 1318. [19] Prataparudra did not offer much resistance, and made a tribute payment in the form of 100 elephants, 12,000 horses, gold, and precious stones. In addition, he agreed to cede five districts of his kingdom to Mubarak Shah. [7]
War against Kampili
[ edit ]
Meanwhile, the Hoysala king Ballala invaded the Kampili kingdom located at the juncture of the Kakatiya, Hoysala and the Delhi Sultanate (formerly Yadava) territories. According to the Kannada language text Kumara-Ramanasangatya, the Kampili prince Kumara Rama sought Prataparudra's assistance against Ballala. Prataparudra refused to help him and his father Kampiliraya , leading to a rivalry between the two kingdoms. Sometime later, Kumara Rama forcibly occupied the western part of the Kakatiya kingdom, and Prataparudra responded by waging a war against Kampili. [19]
According to Srinatha 's Telugu language text Bhimesvara-Puranamu, Prataparudra's commander Prolaya Annaya destroyed the Kampili capital Kummata . [19] Kotikanti Raghava, a son of the Aravidu chief Tata Pinnama (who was probably a Kakatiya feudatory), is credited with having defeated Kampiliraya. These accounts suggest that Prataparudra won battles against Kampili, but he does not appear to have gained any tangible benefit from these victories. [20]
Tughluq invasion
Main article: Siege of Warangal, 1323
Meanwhile, in Delhi, Khusrau Khan murdered Mubarak Shah, and usurped the throne of Delhi in 1320. He was dethroned by a group of rival nobles, and Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq became the new Sultan. According to the 16th century chronicler Firishta , Prataparudra had stopped sending tributes to Delhi by this time. Therefore, Ghiyath al-Din sent his son Ulugh Khan (later Muhammad bin Tughluq ) to Warangal in 1323. Prataparudra put up a strong resistance this time, but ultimately retreated to his capital Warangal. Ulugh Khan besieged Warangal, while another part of the Delhi army led by Abu-Riza besieged Kotagiri . [20]
During the siege, a false rumour about Ghiyath al-Din's death in Delhi caused a rebellion in Ulugh Khan's army, and he had to retreat from Warangal. The Kakatiya army plundered his camp, and pursued him till Kotagiri, where Abu Riza came to his rescue. Ulugh Khan ultimately retreated to Devagiri. [21]
Prataparudra believed that he had achieved a decisive victory, and let his guard down. [22] However, Ghiyath al-Din sent reinforcements to Devagiri, and instructed Ulugh Khan to launch a fresh attack on Warangal. Within four months, Ulugh Khan besieged the fort again, and this time, Prataparudra had to surrender. [23]
Death
[ edit ]
Ulugh Khan sent an imprisoned Prataparudra and his family members to Delhi, escorted by a contingent led by the Tughluq lieutenants Qadir Khan and Khawaja Haji. [22] The Tughluq court historian Shams-i-Siraj Arif simply states that Prataparudra died en route to Delhi. The 1330 Vilasa inscription of Musunuri Prolaya Nayaka states that Prataparudra died on the banks of the Somodbhava ( Narmada ) river, while being taken to Delhi as a captive. The 1423 Kaluvacheru inscription of the Reddi queen Anitalli mentions that he ""departed to the world of Gods by his own desire."" [6] When taken together, these accounts suggest that Prataparudra committed suicide on the banks of the Narmada River while being taken to Delhi as a prisoner. [24]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
National parks in India are International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) category II protected areas . India's first national park was established in 1936, now known as Jim Corbett National Park , in Uttarakhand . In 1970, India had only five national parks. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger in 1973 to safeguard the habitats of conservation reliant species and currently, there are 106 national parks in India. Further legislation strengthening protection for wildlife was introduced in the 1980s.
There are 106 existing national parks in India covering an area of 44,402.95 km2 which is 1.35% of the geographical area of the country. In addition to the above, 75 other national parks covering an area of 16,608 km2 (6,412 sq mi) are proposed in the Protected Area Network Report. The network of parks will go up 176 after full implementation of the above report.

Chartres Cathedral , also known as the Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres, is a Catholic cathedral in Chartres , France, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) southwest of Paris . It is the seat of the bishop of Chartres . Mostly constructed between 1194 and 1220, it stands on the site of at least five cathedrals that have occupied the site since the Diocese of Chartres was formed as an episcopal see in the 4th century. It is one of the best-known and most influential examples of High Gothic and Classic Gothic architecture. Chartres Cathedral is known for its stained glass , and contains 167 stained-glass windows dating from the 12th century to the 20th century. This photograph shows the stained glass in the north transept of Chartres Cathedral. The rose window , which is 10.5 metres (34 feet) in diameter, was installed circa 1230 and contains imagery relating to the Virgin Mary and figures from the Old Testament . The presence of the coats of arms of King Louis IX and his mother Blanche of Castile are taken as a sign of royal patronage for this window. Below the rose are five lancet windows , each 7.5 metres (25 feet) tall, depicting Saint Anne and four Old Testament figures.

.
India has a history of sports dating back to the Vedic period , with Western sports having been imported during British rule . [2] Cricket is the most popular spectator sport; it generates the highest television viewership , with the Indian Premier League (IPL) being the most-followed league in the country. Football has also gained popularity, [3] [b] with the Indian Super League (ISL) being the highest level of domestic football, and the national team winning multiple gold medals at the Asian and South Asian Games . Additional football accomplishments include India having reached the Groupstage of the 1960 Olympics , qualified for the 1950 FIFA World Cup , and won the SAFF Championship . [5] [6] [7] [8] Other sports include kabaddi , badminton , tennis , and athletics , with kho-kho becoming the fourth-most viewed sport. [9] India has also had success in field hockey , winning the World Cup and multiple medals in the Olympic Games . Sports such as golf , rugby , wrestling , boxing , motorsport , and basketball are featured throughout the country. [10]
India's diverse culture and people have influenced the wide variety of sports, with indigenous sports such as fighter kite and boat racing being popular in some regions. Other indigenous sports include chess , kho kho , cycling , polo , snooker and rugby , subject to location. Water sports , like scuba diving , boating , surfing , and kiteboarding , frequently appear in coastal areas. [11] Professional wrestling and mixed martial arts (MMA) are popular among young audiences, [12] with some Indian wrestlers achieving international success. [13] [14] India has hosted the Cricket World Cup three times and won it twice. [c] Field hockey is the most successful sport for India at the Olympics, with the Indian men's team winning thirteen Olympic medals—eight of which were gold. Although it is not considered a professional sport, cycling is a recreational activity and exercise in India. [17]

The world's oldest stadium with terraced stands was constructed in Dholavira , Gujarat , during the third millennium BCE. Two stadiums have been identified at the ancient site: one is considered a ceremonial ground, and the other a small stadium. [23] [24] [25]
Sports were evident during the Vedic era . [2] physical culture in ancient India was fuelled by religious rights.[ specify ] The mantra in the Atharvaveda says, ""Duty is in my right hand and the fruits of victory in my left."". This resembles the Olympic Oath : ""For the Honour of my Country and the Glory of Sport."" [26]
The modern game of badminton developed from an English children's game known as battledore and shuttlecock , a game that was most prominent in ancient India. The battledore was a paddle and the shuttlecock was a small feathered cork, colloquially called a bird. [27]
India has a rich heritage of martial arts . In the Mahabharata and Ramayana , Bhima and Hanuman were the greatest Gadadhari ( transl. One who fights with Gada (the Mace weapon)) and were skilled in wrestling. Lord Krishna 's brother Balarama was a great Gadadhari. During the era of the Mahabharata, Pandava prince Arjun and Ekalavya were expert archers; the Mahabharata is a tale of warring cousins ( Pandavas and Kauravas ). [28] It was believed that this book contained all aspects of Indian life, and whatever was said which was not in the book was not true. Going back to the history of sports, martial arts was one of the earliest sport used for military purposes. This too was limited to only the warrior caste, the Kshatriya . In ancient Greece, the patriarchy was very strict, and likewise ancient India restricted their sports to only men. [29] Kalaripayattu is still practised to this day by some as a traditional martial art in South India.
Board games, including chess and snakes and ladders , originated from the ancient Indian games chaturanga and gyan chauper respectively; these were later brought to foreign countries, where they would be modernized. [30] [31] Chaturanga taught ancient Indians how to strategise for war, and the other board games often imparted spiritual values. [32] [33]
Several Indian variations of tag , such as kabaddi and kho-kho , originated in prehistoric times, with kho-kho being played as far back as the fourth century BCE. [34] Atya-patya , a variant of tag, was mentioned in the Naṟṟiṇai (written in 300 CE). [35] [36] [37] Kabaddi and atya-patya in particular were used for military training purposes. [37] [38] During the rule of the Mughal Empire , pehlwani , a form of wrestling, was developed by combining native malla-yuddha with Persian varzesh-e bastani . [39]
Several other activities were partaken in for recreation, such as hunting, gambling in dice-games, etc. [40]
British Colonial period
[ edit ]

During the colonial period , British India [h] competed at six Olympic Games , winning medals in field hockey . [i] British sports were introduced into India during that period. Some Indians were variously participating in British sports to rise up the social hierarchy by imitating their colonisers [43] as well as aiming to achieve victory against the British in their sports. [44] The British also aimed to spread their sports among Indians as a way of spreading British values. [29] [45] Efforts were made to develop the native games of India during this time period; this led to the successful standardisation of games such as kabaddi and kho-kho, [46] [47] as well as their demonstration in the 1936 Summer Olympics . [48] However, the economic struggles prevailing at the time limited people's overall ability to participate in sport. [49]
In the early days, the British began clubs, which only whites could join. These clubs were a place where men could gather together to drink, socialize, and play sports. British soldiers would play British sports as a way of maintaining fitness, since the mortality rate for foreigners in India was high at the time, as well as to maintain a sense of Britishness; in the words of a contemporary writer, playing British sports was a way to ""defend themselves from the magic of the land"". The different games played in the clubs would be cricket, badminton, rugby , golf , and rowing . [29]
Snooker originated in the late 19th century among British Army officers stationed in India. [50] Modern polo originated in British India in the 19th century [j] in Manipur , where the game was known as Sagol Kangjei, Kanjai-bazee, or Pulu. The name polo is the anglicized version of the lattermost term. The first polo club was established in Silchar , Assam , in 1833. The oldest polo club still in existence is the Calcutta Polo Club , which was established in 1862. [51] [52] [53]
Dorabji Tata , with the support of Dr. A.G. Noehren, the then-director of YMCA , established the Indian Olympic Association in 1927. [54]
One of the world's earliest football clubs, the Mohun Bagan was established in 1889. The club was formed when The Football Association began making standard rules for football. Before FIFA , the international governing body of football[ clarification needed ] was founded.
Sport as a Symbol of National Power
[ edit ]
India has been under direct British colonial rule since 1858, and showed constant political, social, and cultural resistance throughout history. Though the British Raj has attained direct control over the subcontinent, there is a perspective that the Native Indians were able to cultivate their own form of national empowerment and a sense of implicit sovereignty through means of sport.

The British used sport as another conduit of transferring British socio-political ideas, culture, and beliefs into the fabric of India's system. As Australian author Brian Stoddart writes in his article on British sports and cultural imperialism, “Colonial governors were especially important in emphasizing cricket as a ritual demonstration of British behavior, standards, and moral codes in both public and private.” [58] Despite many Indians being a part of white-dominated sports teams, there was an inevitably constant re-emphasis of the superior and inferior race ideology within the teams. During this era, there was a prevailing mindset amongst the British colonizers, being the fact that they viewed the Indians through a lens of superiority, which was reflected through socio-political events, specifically through sports. The British believed that the Indians were the inferior and effeminate race, taking the opportunity of sport as a mission to mold, reshape and therefore improve the Native race into a stronger, more physically capable race. [59] However, unsurprisingly, the native Indians were not keen on giving up their traditions to follow their colonizers, as author Subhadipa Dutta emphasizes through the quote of “the colonized were not always fascinated to ‘mimic’ the manly gestures and leisure pursuits of their white masters.” To illustrate this, in his book, Ramachandra Guha has delved deep into the political aspect of religion, race and caste within sports teams, especially cricket . Guha successfully highlights the significance of the socio-cultural factors that are entwined in cricket, and how it encouraged the indigenization of the sport. [60]
Consequently, a strong desire stemming from frustration arose from the Indians; a desire to essentially reclaim their country that has been controlled by Europeans. The theory that Indians resisted British colonialism through sports to regain power over their country has been evident in various scholarly articles, books, and monographs. Specifically, in the 1963 memoir Beyond a Boundary , Tranidian Marxist intellectual C. L. R. James compares Indians on the field to Greek drama plays: “selected individuals played representative roles which were charged with social significance.” [61] The author explains that there is irony between the English origins of the sport and the means of which Indians use it as a way to express their national identity – an identity which they feel was stolen from them as a result of the British Raj or ruling. This is further evident through the quote of “... [S]ocial and political passions denied normal outlets, expressed themselves so fiercely in cricket precisely because they were games.” [61]
Furthermore, emphasizing and delving deep into its meanings, the memoir offers crucial points regarding the concept of native Indians expressing sovereignty within the games that they play. The memoir leads the reader to speculate beyond the meaning of cricket being a game for pleasure to view Englishness as an inherent and leading force within the actual sport. Through the lens of James’ memoir, the sport evolves into a nuance where Englishness intersects with West Indian identity formation, both in and beyond the field. [62] Indians used sports as a gateway or an opportunity to regain national pride and identity, ultimately fighting against the British narrative. The colonized therefore developed their own physical strength and power while confronting and rejecting the components of imperial ideology. They developed proud self-image throughout time as a significant step for achieving freedom and establishing popular sovereignty, which underscores the revolutionary power of resistance among Indians against their British colonizers through harvesting strength and national self-determination and identity.
Post-Independence

The Eden Gardens in Kolkata , established in 1864, is the oldest cricket stadium in India. It has been part of several historic cricket matches. [k] [l]
Until the 1970s, poverty limited Indians' ability to play ball sports; [63] however, when India won the 1983 Cricket World Cup , cricket rose to popularity [64] while the former favorite sport field hockey was declining. [65] International sport and sporting leagues quickly grew after the economic liberalisation of the 1990s , which allowed more money to be invested into sports. [66] The Indian Premier League (IPL), which started in 2007, quickly became the most dominant league in the country and is highly influential in global cricket; [67] by 2022, it was only behind America's National Football League in terms of being the most valued league in the world on a per-match basis. [68] Several other sports leagues quickly popped up after the IPL, with the Indian Super League becoming one of the biggest leagues and playing a significant role in Indian football. [69] Other leagues (such as the Pro Kabaddi League , Ultimate Kho Kho , and the Pro Panja League ) contributed to the modernisation of indigenous sports. [70] [71] [72] [73] Kabaddi has become an international sport, with countries such as South Korea and Iran playing it. [74]
Several factors have explained India's lack of success in international sport, such as economic hardship, lack of emphasis on sports other than cricket in Indian culture, corruption, and a lack of investment in sports. [75] [76] Indians seeking to become professional athletes are often encouraged to instead pursue higher-paying professions and help their families economically; surveys indicate that Indians also spend substantially less time playing sports than people in OECD countries . [77] In recent decades[ when? ], the Government of India and Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports have tried to promote sports in the country by launching and organising new national sports events such as the Khelo India Youth Games (KIYG), Khelo India Winter Games , and Khelo India University Games (KIUG) of Khelo India games in various cities across the nation. [m] The first Khelo India School Games was held in 2018. [n] KIYG and KIUG are set up as annual events for children and teenagers, who represent their states and universities in them. [79] [80] The Indian government has also tripled its sports budget from 2014 to 2023, and is looking to host the 2036 Olympics . [81]
India founded the Asian Games , which is considered to be the world's second-largest sporting event behind the Olympic Games , [82] as a way to make itself relevant in the new post-colonial world order. [20] [83] It hosted the Games in New Delhi for the inaugural edition in 1951 and again in 1982 . The current Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports was initially set up as the Department of Sports in 1982 at the time of organisation of the Games in New Delhi. Its name was changed to the Department of Youth Affairs and Sports during International Youth Year in 1985. [84] India has also hosted and co-hosted several international sporting events, including the 1987 , 1996 and 2011 Cricket World Cups , the 2003 Afro-Asian Games , the 2010 Hockey World Cup , and the 2010 Commonwealth Games . Major international sporting events annually held in India include the Chennai Open , the Mumbai Marathon and the Delhi Half Marathon . The country hosted the first Indian Grand Prix in 2011. [85] The largest stadium in the world, the Narendra Modi Stadium , is in India.
Administration
The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports is a ministry of the Government of India for sport in the country. Anurag Thakur is the incumbent sports minister of India. [86]
The ministry is run by a Secretary to the Government of India, and is usually headed by a Minister of State . [87] A ministry-recognised National Sports Federation Of India (NSFOI) represents each Olympic and non-Olympic sport—the only major exception being the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which is not an NSFOI. [88] [o] As of 2019 [update] , 56 NSFs are recognised by the ministry. [90] The presence of politicians at the helm of many such federations has been criticised for causing inefficiency and corruption. [88]
For each sport, India has a separate governing body. These include the All India Football Federation for football, National Rifle Association of India for shooting, and Boxing Federation of India for boxing .
The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) is responsible for the Indian contingent's participation in the Olympic Games , Commonwealth Games , Asian Games (outdoor, indoor and beach), South Asian Games , Lusofonia Games , World Games and Military World Games . The selection of the national teams is done by the respective national federations and then recommended to the IOA for official sponsorship for participation in those games. [54] The Paralympic Committee of India is responsible for the Indian participation in the Paralympic Games and Asian Para Games . The All India Sports Council for the Deaf is responsible for India's participation in the Deaflympics Games, and the Special Olympics Bharat is responsible for India's participation in the Special Olympics .
The Association of Indian Universities is responsible for India participating in the Universiade Games, while the School Games Federation of India is responsible for India's participation in the Gymnasiade Games.

[190] The lure for most of these participants is adventure. Whitewater kayaking in India allows for exploration of places where, literally, no human has been before.
Gear availability is a problem that plagues kayakers. While the global designs for whitewater boats and paddles change annually, Indian kayakers have to pay high fees if they want to import any kind of gear, or they have to buy used gear in Nepal. More often than not, one will see Indian kayaking guides riding down the river in a Perception Amp, Piroutte or Dancer designs, while the kayakers from abroad ride the river in their new design, planing hull, centred-volume kayaks from Riot, Pyranha, or Wave Sport.

It is Asia's longest mountain bike race, bikers around the world take part in this mountain race. [194]
For the last six years, Mtb himachal , a hardcore endurance event, has been organised regularly by Himalayan Adventure Sports & Tourism Promotion Association (HASTPA), a non-governmental organisation (NGO). A number of national and international riders participate, including Indian Army, Indian Air Force , Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), and a number of young and energetic mountain biking individual riders from cities including Pune , Bangalore, Delhi and Chandigarh .

Road Cycling/Touring
The Tour of Nilgiris is a major non-competitive and non-commercial touring event in South Asia that covers 1,000 kilometres in under 10 days. [195] The Tour of Nilgiris (TfN), India's first Day Touring Cycle Ride, was born in December 2008 with the twin objectives of promoting bicycling as an activity and spreading awareness about the bio-diversity, flora and fauna of the Nilgiris.
It soon grew into something a lot more, with an eclectic riding community in 2008 wanting to participate. The community soon assembled, made plans, chose a route and realised they would need a framework to support such a large group of people. So they recruited sponsors to mitigate costs as well as popularise the Tour and the cause of popularising cycling as a viable and sustainable means of travel. Ever since its first edition, the TfN has stayed true to the Community of Cyclists in India by being a Tour for the Community, Of the Community and By the Community. It has grown in size, stature and visibility. From 40 riders in the first edition, it has grown to 100 cyclists in 2013.[ tone ]
The tour has grown bigger and the routes tougher, allowing cyclists to test their endurance, enjoy the biodiversity of the Nilgiris covering the southern states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. For the racing aficionados, there are racing segments on the tour with colour coded jerseys, recognition and prizes. TfN as it is lovingly called is pushing cycling to new frontiers with more and more interested cyclists, applying for the tour. The tour has acquired quite a name, and currently about 25% of registrations are selected for the tour by the organisers.[ citation needed ][ tone ]

List of hill stations in India
3 languages
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Mussoorie , called as queen of hill stations
Hill stations are high-altitude towns for recreation, enjoyment and used as a place of refuge to escape the blistering heat in India during summertime. As India is a vast country with limited amounts of the coastal area most of its towns and districts face continental type of climate with summer being very hot so hill stations (as situated on high altitude due to which it faces low temperature) becomes a spot to escape such hot and humid conditions.
The Indian subcontinent has seven principal mountain ranges and the largest of all is the Himalayas that lies in the northern part of India. The famous peaks and ranges include the Kangchenjunga range in the Eastern Himalayas which frames the hill stations of Darjeeling and Gangtok as well as the Nanda Devi in Uttarakhand . The Shivalik range that also lies within the same region also has some famous hill stations that include Mussoorie , Drass , Dalhousie , Kullu , Shimla , Nainital and many more. [1]
Most hill stations in India were developed by the British around a central mall to get respite from the oppressive summer heat. Many have picturesque lakes as their focal point, making them excellent places for boating activities.
Most hill stations in India are located in the states of Jammu and Kashmir , Ladakh , Manipur , Himachal Pradesh , Uttarakhand , Sikkim , West Bengal , Arunachal Pradesh , Mizoram , Nagaland and Meghalaya in the Himalayas and in the states of Gujarat , Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Kerala , and Tamil Nadu in Western ghats. [2] Some are located in Eastern ghats of Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh , Odisha and West Bengal . Some of the hill stations in India are listed below by state .
Since a number of these hill stations attract large numbers of tourists in summer as well as other times of the year, they are well connected by rail, road, and air services to major Indian cities.
History
Nandi Hills was developed by Ganga Dynasty in 11th century. [3] [4] It was also used by Tipu Sultan (1751 - 1799) as a summer retreat. [5]
Hill stations in British India were established for a variety of reasons. After the revolt of 1857 the ""British sought further distance from what they saw as a "" disease-ridden "" land by escape to the Himalayas in the north and Nilgiri Hills in the south"", a pattern which started even before 1857. Other factors included anxieties about the dangers of life in India, among them ""fear of degeneration brought on by too long residence in a debilitating land."" The hill stations were meant to reproduce the home country, illustrated in Lord Lytton 's statement about Ootacamund , in the 1870s, ""such beautiful English rain, such delicious English mud."" [6] Shimla was officially made the ""summer capital of India"" in the 1860s and hill stations ""served as vital centers of political and military power, especially after the 1857 revolt."" [7] : 2
Dane Kennedy, following Monika Bührlein, identifies three stages in the evolution of hill stations in India: high refuge to hill station, and hill station to town . The first settlements started in the 1820s, primarily as sanitoria . In the 1840s and 1850s, there was a wave of new hill stations, with the main impetus being ""places to rest and recuperate from the arduous life on the plains"". In the second half of the 19th century, there was a period of consolidation with few new hill stations. In the final phase, ""hill stations reached their zenith in the late nineteenth century. The political importance of the official stations was underscored by the inauguration of large and costly public-building projects."" [7] : 14
Siddharth Pandey analyses the femininity often ascribed to Indian hills stations, in their nomenclature (such as 'the Queen of hills', as claimed by Shimla, Ooty, and several other hill stations) as well as the visual aesthetic of their landscapes. He argues that compared to the 'terrifying, sublime landscape' of the high Himalayan peaks and ridges, the hill stations have a gentler aspect, manageable and conducive for domestication. With ideas of domesticity having been traditionally associated with the feminine and household spheres, hill stations, which were developed by the colonialists as 'homes away from home', acquired over time a sense of being feminine, in terms of both their natural as well as their architectural beauty.

History of Telangana
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Part of a series on the
The history of Telangana , located on the high Deccan Plateau , includes its being ruled by the Satavahana Dynasty (230 BCE to 220 CE), the Kakatiya Dynasty (1083–1323), the Musunuri Nayaks (1325–1438), the Delhi Sultanate , the Bahmani Sultanate (1347–1512), Golconda Sultanate (1512–1687) and Asaf Jahi dynasty (1724–1950). [1]
In 1724, Nizam-ul-Mulk defeated Mubariz Khan and conquered Hyderabad. His successors ruled the princely state of Hyderabad, as Nizams of Hyderabad . The Nizams established first railways , postal and telegraph networks, and the first modern universities in Telangana.
After Indian independence, the Nizam did not sign the instrument of accession to India . The Indian army invaded and annexed Hyderabad State in 1948. From 1948 to 1956, Telangana remained as part of Hyderabad State , and then it was merged into Andhra Pradesh , a state created for Telugu people. In 2014, Telangana became the 29th state of India after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, consisting of thirty-three (33) districts, with Hyderabad as its capital. [2] The city of Hyderabad served as the joint capital for the residual Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for a period of ten years until 2024. [3] [4]
Early history
Main article: Satavahana dynasty
The Satavahanas rose to a political power, after the fall of the Mauryan Empire . Koti Lingala seems to be one of the 30 cities of Satavahana dynasty. [5] Excavations revealed brick wells, coins belonging to a pre-Satavahana period, namely, Gobhada and Samagopa. It is believed that the place is the site of the hermitage of sage Bhavari. [6] Several coins of Simukha, the founder of the Satavahana dynasty, and those of other early rulers like Kanha and Satakarni I were found. [7]
The Deccan, during this period, was an emporium of inland and maritime trade. The region between the rivers of Godavari and Krishna was full of ports and throbbing with activity[ citation needed ]. There was plentiful of currency to facilitate trade and the people entered upon a period of great industrial, commercial and maritime activity. Buddhism flourished throughout the period and the rulers were also devoted to Vedic ritualism. They constructed several Buddhist Stupas, Viharas and Chaityas. Satavahanas were able rulers and loved literacy and architecture. The 17th ruler of this dynasty, Hāla was a great poet and his ""Gathasaptasati"" in Prakrit was well received by all. Gunadhnya, the minister of Hala was the author of ""Brihatkadha"". According to Matsya Purana, there were 29 rulers of this dynasty. They ruled over for about 456 years, from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD. The empire included most of the southern peninsula and some southern parts of the present Indian states of Maharashtra , Orissa and Madhya Pradesh . The court language used by the Satavahanas was Prakrit .
The decline and fall of the Satavahana Empire left the state in a political chaos. Local rulers, as well as invaders, tried to carve out small kingdoms for themselves and to establish many dynasties. Such instability continued to prevail until the rise of the Western Chalukyas .[ citation needed ]
Kakatiya dynasty
The 12th and 13th centuries saw the emergence of the Kakatiya dynasty . [9] The Kakatiyas are known for their famous architecture such as Warangal Fort , Ramappa Temple , Thousand Pillar Temple and Kota Gullu . [10] [11]
At first they were feudatories of the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani , ruling over a small territory near Warangal . A ruler of this dynasty, Prola II (1110–1158), extended his sway to the south and declared his independence. His successor Rudra (1158–1195) pushed the kingdom to the east up to the Godavari delta. He built Warangal Fort to serve as a second capital and faced the invasions of the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri . The next ruler, Mahadeva, extended the kingdom to the coastal area.  Ganapati Deva succeeded him in 1199. He was the greatest of the Kakatiyas and the first after the Satavahanas to bring almost the entire Telugu area under one unified empire. Ganapati put an end to the rule of the Velanati Cholas in 1210 and extended his empire to Anakapalle in the north.
The most prominent ruler in this dynasty was Rani Rudrama Devi (1262–1289), one of the few queens in Indian history. An able fighter and ruler, Rudrama defended the kingdom against the Cholas and the Seuna Yadavas , earning their respect. Marco Polo visited India during her reign and made note of her rule. [12]
On the death of Rudrama at the beginning of 1290, her grandson Prataparudra II ascended the throne. Prataparudra had to fight battles throughout his reign against either internal rebels or external foes. Prataparudra expanded his borders to the west to Raichur and in the south to Ongole and the Nallamala Hills , whilst introducing many administrative reforms, some of which were also later adopted in the Vijayanagara empire .
In 1309, the Sultan of Delhi , Alauddin Khilji sent his general Malik Kafur on an expedition to the Kakatiya kingdom. [13] Kafur's army reached the Kakatiya capital Warangal in January 1310, and breached its outer fort after a month-long siege . [14] The Kakatiya ruler Prataparudra decided to surrender and agreed to pay tribute. Kafur returned to Delhi in June 1310 with a huge amount of wealth obtained from the defeated king.
Invasion by Delhi Sultanate
Main article: Siege of Warangal, 1323
In 1323, Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq sent his son Ulugh Khan on an expedition to the Kakatiya capital of Warangal. The ensuing Siege of Warangal resulted in the annexation of Warangal, and the end of the Kakatiya dynasty. [15] Prataparudra was taken captive, and sent to Delhi, but it is believed he died en route. Ulugh Khan ruled briefly as viceroy, until he returned to Delhi to succeed the throne.
As early as 1330, the Musunuri Nayaks who served as army chiefs for Kakatiya kingdom united the various Telugu clans and recovered Warangal from the viceroy of the Delhi Sultanate and ruled for half a century. Surrounded by more significant states, by the 15th century these new entities had ceded to the Bahmani Sultanate and the Sangama dynasty , the latter of which evolved to become the Vijayanagara empire . [16]
Bahmani and Deccan Sultanates
The Qutb Shahi Monuments of Hyderabad were submitted by India in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage status in 2011. [17]
The Bahmani Sultanate ruled the region in the 15th century. In 1463, Sultan Muhammad Shah Bahmani II dispatched Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk to the Telangana region to quell disturbances. Sultan Quli quelled the disturbance and was rewarded as the administrator of the region. He established a base at Kakatiya hill fortress of Golconda which he strengthened and expanded considerably. By the end of the century, Quli ruled from Golconda as the subedar (governor) of the Telangana region. Quli enjoyed virtual independence from Bidar , where the Bahmani Sultanate was then based. In 1518, the Bahmani Sultanate disintegrated into five different kingdoms, with the others based in Ahmednagar , Berar , Bidar and Bijapur . Sultan Quli declared independence from the Bahmani rule and established the Golconda Sultanate under the title ""Sultan Quli Qutub Shah"", [18] [19] he rebuilt the mud-fort of Golconda and named the city Muhammad Nagar. [20] [21]
During this period, the city of Hyderabad was established by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah in 1591, on the banks of the Musi River . [22] The Charminar and Mecca Masjid were constructed to form a centerpiece of the city. Over the years, Hyderabad would grow as an important trading center for diamonds, pearls, arms and steel.
The Qutb Shahi rulers were patrons of both Indo-Persian and the local Telugu art and culture. [23] Early Indo-Islamic type of architecture is reflected in the Qutb Shahi buildings. Some examples of it include the Golconda Fort , Qutb Shahi tombs , Charminar , Mecca Masjid , Khairtabad Mosque , Taramati Baradari and Toli Mosque .
Mughal conquest and rule
Aurangzeb during the Siege of Golconda . The Mughal victory over Golconda led to the end of the Qutb Shahi dynasty .
Mughal prince Aurangzeb spent most of his time in the Deccan, fighting local Hindu and Muslim kingdoms alike to establish Mughal sovereignty. The Golconda Sultanate faced various attacks by the Mughal prince Aurangzeb , who was appointed Viceroy of the Deccan by his father and Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan . It was forced to pay an annual tribute to the Mughal Empire.
In 1656, Aurangzeb attacked Golconda Fort by surprise but was forced to call off the siege on orders of Shah Jahan . Therefore, a treaty was signed between Abdullah Qutb Shah and Aurangzeb , when the former accepted Mughal sovereignty, paid an annual tribute and married his daughter to Aurangzeb's eldest son . [24] [25]
After becoming Mughal Emperor , Aurangzeb returned to the Deccan. He captured Hyderabad and besieged Golconda in 1687, and the refused any negotiations. [26] On 22 September 1687, after a nine month long siege, Golconda was captured. Abul Hasan Qutb Shah was taken prisoner, and Hyderabad's diamond trade was all but destroyed.
Nizams of Hyderabad
Main articles: Nizam of Hyderabad and Hyderabad State
The Nizams of Hyderabad , also known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty, ruled Hyderabad State , [note 1] which comprised Telangana , Marathwada and Kalyana-Karnataka from 1724 to 1948. Under this period, Hyderabad State was the largest princely state in British India , and had its own mint , currency , railway and postal system. The Nizam acquired massive amounts of wealth due to the diamond trade.
Asaf Jah I
Main article: Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I
With the emaciation of the Mughal Empire after Aurangzeb's death in 1707, the Mughal-appointed governors of the Deccan Suba ( Deccan province) gained more autonomy from Delhi. In 1714, the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar appointed Mir Qamar-ud-din Siddiqi as the viceroy to the Deccan and gave him the title of Nizam-ul-Mulk (governor of the country). He was well suited for the position as he had fought alongside his father and grandfather who were commanders during the siege of Hyderabad.
In 1724, he defeated Mubariz Khan to establish control over Hyderabad. He received the title of Asaf Jah from Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah in the following year. Thus began the Asaf Jahi dynasty that would rule Hyderabad State until a year after India's independence from Britain.
Successors of Asaf Jah I

When Asaf Jah I died in 1748, there was political unrest due to contention for the throne among his sons, who were aided by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces.
The death of Asaf Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons, backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces, contended for the throne. The accession of Asif Jah II , who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768 he signed the Treaty of Machilipatnam , surrendering the coastal region to the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent. [27]
In 1769 Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Nizams. [28] [29] In response to regular threats from Hyder Ali (Dalwai of Mysore ), Baji Rao I ( Peshwa of the Maratha Empire ), and Basalath Jung (Asaf Jah II's elder brother, who was supported by the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau ), the Nizam signed a subsidiary alliance with the East India Company in 1798, allowing the British Indian Army to occupy Bolarum (modern Secunderabad ) to protect the state's capital, for which the Nizams paid an annual maintenance to the British. [27]
When the British and the French spread their hold over the country, successive Nizams won their friendship without bequeathing their power. The Nizams allied themselves with each side at different times, playing a significant role in the Anglo-Mysore Wars .
As an offshoot of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , Maulvi Allauddin and Turrebaz Khan led attacks on the British Residency . [30]
The Great Musi flood of 1908 ravaged the city of Hyderabad and resulted in the death of at least 15,000 people. [31]
Last Nizam
[ edit ]
In 1911, Mir Osman Ali Khan , the seventh and last Nizam of Hyderabad succeeded his father. He was widely known for his wealth and considered one of the wealthiest men of all time. The development of early modern Hyderabad took place during his reign.
Being a secular ruler, he is known for his donations and yearly grants towards various Hindu temples like Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala , Lakshmi Narasimha Temple, Yadadri . [32] [33] He also donated a grant of 1 Lakh Hyderabadi Rupees towards the reconstruction of Thousand Pillar Temple . [34]
He also donated money and yearly grants for research work for 11 years for the compilation of the Hindu holy book ""Mahabharata"" at Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute , Pune. [35] [32]
Telangana Rebellion
Main article: Telangana Rebellion
In late 1945, there started a peasant uprising in Telangana area, led by the Comrades Association (representing Communist Party of India ) also known as The Telangana Rebellion or Vetti Chakiri Udyamam or Telangana Raithanga Sayudha Poratam. The communists drew their support from various quarters.
Among the poor peasants, there were grievances against the jagirdari system, which covered 43% of landholding. Initially, they also drew support from wealthier peasants who also fought under the communist banner, but by 1948, the coalition had disintegrated.
Initially, in 1945, the communists targeted zamindars and deshmukhs, but soon they launched a full-fledged revolt against the Nizam. Starting mid-1946, the conflict between the Razakars (a private militia led by Kasim Razvi ) and the communists became increasingly violent, with both sides resorting to increasingly brutal methods. The Razakars cordoned off villages, captured suspected communists en masse and engaged in ""absolutely indiscriminate and organised"" (according to one Congressman) looting and massacres. According to an Indian government pamphlet, the communists had killed about 2,000 people by 1948. [36]
Post-Independence
India became independent from the United Kingdom in 1947. The Nizam of Hyderabad wanted to explore his options of independence from India, but was forced to cede his state to India in 1948 to form Hyderabad State .

Died
Shia Islam
Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah (4 April 1565 – 11 January 1612) was the fifth sultan of the Sultanate of Golconda and founder of the city of Hyderabad . [2] He built its architectural centerpiece, the Charminar . He was an able administrator and his reign is considered one of the high points of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. He ascended to the throne in 1580 at the age of 15 and ruled for 31 years. [3]
Early life and reign
Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah was the third son of Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah Wali of the Sultanate of Golconda and Hindu mother Bhagirathi. [4]

Founding of Hyderabad
[ edit ]
From the time of his father Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah, there was a high influx of populace into the city of Golconda , which led to over-crowding and unhygienic conditions. This created the need for an extension or new city. [3] The construction of Hyderabad was initiated in 1591, on the southern bank of the River Musi . Before construction he prayed by reciting the following couplet for the welfare of the  city: ""Make my city full of people, like you keep the river full of fish."" [5]
There is a degree of folklore associated with selection of the land for the new city of Hyderabad. It is said that once the sultan was coming back from a hunt and he crossed the bridge across River Musi and arrived at the flat land which pleased him. However, Muhammad Quli must have been aware of the presence of this land and the story is a romanticised version. [3]
The city was planned in a gridiron manner with the Charminar in the centre and other important palaces and administrative buildings along the surrounding axes. Other important buildings which were constructed in the following years such as Dar-ul-Shifa , Mecca Masjid , Badshahi Ashurkhana and several palaces which have since been demolished. [5]
Muhammad Quli also planned several gardens throughout the city. [5]
Patronage of art and literature
[ edit ]
Dancing before Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Golconda, about 1590
Muhammad Quli was a patron of poetry, paintings, calligraphy and architecture. Major scripts used in this period are Nastaliq, Naksh, Kufi, Tughra and Sulus. A unique inscription is on Mecca Masjid in Nastaliq script, a script not known anywhere else in the Deccan region. Another inscription in the same mosque is a verse of the Quran carved in Naksh style. [5] [6]
Muhammad Quli was an accomplished poet and wrote his poetry in Persian , Telugu and Urdu . [7] [3] He is considered one of the first poets to write in the Deccani Urdu language. He wrote in a wide range of genres from religious to romantic to profane. [3] He composed his verses in the Persian diwan style, and his poems consisted of verses relating to a single topic, gazal-i musalsal. [7] His poetry has been compiled into a volume entitled Kulliyat-e-Quli Qutub Shah. [8] Over half of its 1800 pages were gazals, while qasidas were present on one hundred pages, and the rest over 300 pages of matnawi and marsiyas. [7] He was the first Saheb-e-dewan Urdu poet. [8]
Physicians who wrote Persian language books on Unani medicine during his reign include Mir Momin (Ikhtiyarat-i Qutub Shahi), Shamsuddin Ali Husain al-Jurjani      (Tazkirat-i Kahhalin), Hakim Shamsuddin bin Nuruddin (Zubdat-ul Hukama), Abdullah Tabib (Tibb-i Farid), Taqiuddin Muhammad bin Sadruddin Ali (Mizan-ul Tabai'), Nizamuddin Ahmad Gilani (Majmu'a-i Hakim-ul mulk), and Ismai'l bin Ibrahim Tabrezi (Tazkirat-ul Hukama).

[62] The first municipal body that governed the municipal population of the city came into being in 1907 in erstwhile Bhopal estate, and was called Majlis-e-intezamia"". [63] The first city survey was conducted in 1916 after the enactment of Municipal act. [63] Till 1956, the area under Bhopal Municipal limit was very small, after which surrounding villages were added to it. [63] By 1975, the municipal limit reached 71.23 square km. [63] Bhopal Municipal Council got the status of Municipal Corporation, with total of 56 wards in 1983. [64]
Civic administration
[ edit ]

Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) is the urban civic body which oversees the needs of Bhopal city. [63] The municipal corporation follows guidelines under the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956, [65] as well as the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1961. [66] [67] In 2015, Kolar Municipal Corporation merged with it, after having been split from it earlier. [68] In 2019, it was announced that the corporation would be split again and a proposal was put forth to the urban administration and housing department, which was criticised by the mayor-in-council. [3] [69] It also proposed for indirect election of the mayor. [70]
The municipal corporation is spread over an area of 463 km2 (179 sq mi) and has a population of 17,95,648. [2] [3] [4] [71] The city is divided into 14 zones and 85 wards for the purpose of administration, and each ward is represented by a councillor elected for a term of five years. [72] [73] The winning party elects a council of members, who are responsible for various departments. [74] Ward committees as well as Mohalla committees have been prescribed by the corporation act. [75] In October 2016, the Pioneer reported the meeting of one ward committee in the city. [76] Madhya Pradesh is one of the few states in India, which uses the Mayor-in-Council (MIC) system and hence the elected representatives of the Bhopal Municipal Corporation are also organised as MIC. [77] There are multiple municipal departments in BMC such as Health and Environment; Education, Social JusticeFood and Culture; Planning and Rehabilitation; Public Relations and Library; Fire Brigade and Transport; Power; Engineering; Revenue and Project; Accounting; JnNURM; M.P.U.S.P and General Administration. [78]

[97] While the municipality website states that door-to-door collection was started by BMC at each zone and ward level from 15 August 2013, [98] Free Press Journal has reported in 2020 that the civic body has failed in the same. [99] Bhopal has 8 transfer stations, where the garbage collected zone wise is dumped, and without any segregation, the waste is transferred to the Adampur Chhawni landfill site . [99] In 2018, after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed the BMC to clean dump at Bhanpur , which activists claim is 80 feet high and has polluted ground water up to 500 metres below, the trenching ground was shifted to Adampur. [100] In 2019, it was announced that India's first e-waste clinic was being set up in Bhopal. BMC along with Central Pollution Control Board came together to establish this clinic which will enable segregation, processing and disposal of waste, both residential and commercial.

Kakatiya Kala Thoranam
Completed
c. 1200 CE
Kakatiya Kala Thoranam (also called Warangal Gate) is a historical arch in the Warangal district , of the Indian state of Telangana . The Warangal Fort has four ornamental gates which originally formed the gates to the ruins of the great Shiva temple which are known as Kakatiya Kala Thoranam or Warangal Gates. The architectural feature of these historical arches of the Warangal Fort has been adopted as the symbol of the Kakatiya Dynasty and has been officially incorporated as the Emblem of Telangana for the state of Telangana. [1]
The arch was built around 12th century during the rule of the Kakatiya dynasty. [2] The Monument was included in the "" tentative list "" of UNESCO World Heritage Site . The Monument was submitted by the Permanent Delegation of India to UNESCO on 10/09/2010. [3] [4]
History
[ edit ]
Kakatiya Kala Thoranam (Warangal Gate) and Ruins
The Kakatiya Kala Thoranam, or arch, is an extensive ornamented stone sculpture; reflective of four identical gates in the Warangal Fort, which was part of the great Swayambhusiva temple of Shiva in the fort built by Ganapati-deva (1199-1262) during the 12th century. [5] His daughter Rudrama Devi and Pratap Rudra II of the Kakatiya Dynasty added more fortifications to the fort which was laid in three concentric circles. [6] The four gateways (char kaman) were part of the temple which was destroyed by the Muslim invader Jauna Khan during the 1323 invasion , as a part of their policy followed after their victories over territories, to desecrate Hindu temples . [6] The great temple of which the gates were integral is said to be comparable to the size and splendor of the Rudra Mahalaya Temple at Siddhpur in Gujarat . [7]
Features
[ edit ]
The arch depicted on a stamp
A depiction of the arch forms the main symbol in the Emblem of Telangana for the state of Telangana. [8] [9] This logo or emblem, in English , Telugu and Urdu is portrayed with a combination of green and gold, representing ""Bangaru Telangana"" (meaning: ""Golden Telangana""). Also inscribed on the logo are the names of the Government of Telangana in English, and as ""Telangana Prabhutvam"" in Telugu and as ""Telangana Sarkar"" in Urdu. At the base of the logo there is an inscription in Sanskrit which says "" Satyameva Jayate "" (meaning: Truth shall triumph). [1]
The central part of the fort, identified as the archaeological zone, contains the ruins of the great Swayambhusiva temple, now seen with only the free-standing ""Entrance Portals"", or gates on the four sides, all being similar in design. Each gate has twin pillars with angled brackets over which lies the huge lintel ; the height of this gate being 10 metres (33 ft). The gates have extensive intricate carvings of ""lotus buds, looped garlands, mythical animals, and birds with foliated tails"". They do not depict any religious symbols, said to be the reason for its preserved condition for not being destroyed by Muslim invaders. [7] [10] The gates at the northern and southern ends are 480 feet (150 m) apart. The eastern and western gates are at a distance of 433 feet (132 m) apart. [7]
Replicas
A replica of the gateway has been installed at Narsingi . [11]

Nizam of Hyderabad
Historic monarch of the Hyderabad State of India

Nizam-ul-Mulk of Hyderabad Deccan
Coat of Arms of the Hyderabad
First to reign Chin Qilich Khan 31 July 1724 – 1 June 1748
Details
Mir Osman Ali Khan
Nizam of Hyderabad was the title of the ruler of Hyderabad State (now [update] part of the Indian state of Telangana , the Marathwada region of Maharashtra and the Kalyana-Karnataka region of Karnataka ). Nizam is a shortened form of Niẓām ul-Mulk ( Persian : نظام‌ الملک; lit. 'Administrator of the Realm'), and was the title bestowed upon Asaf Jah I when he was appointed Viceroy of the Deccan by the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar . In addition to being the Mughal Viceroy ( Naib ) of the Deccan, Asaf Jah I was also the premier courtier of the Mughal Empire until 1724, when he established an independent realm based in Hyderabad , but in practice, continued to recognise the nominal authority of emperor.
The Asaf Jahi dynasty was founded by Chin Qilich Khan (Asaf Jah I), who served as a Naib of the Deccan sultanates under the Mughal Empire from 1713 to 1721. He intermittently ruled the region after Emperor Aurangzeb 's death in 1707. In 1724 Mughal control weakened, and Asaf Jah became virtually independent. [1] [2] [3] Later the Nizam defeated the Marathas with the alliance of the British.
When the English East India Company achieved paramountcy over the Indian subcontinent , they allowed the Nizams to continue to rule their princely states as client kings. The Nizams retained internal power over Hyderabad State until 17 September 1948, when Hyderabad was integrated into the new Indian Union. [4]
The Asaf Jahi dynasty had only seven recognized rulers, but there was a period of 13 unstable years after the rule of the first Nizam when two of his sons, Nasir Jung ,and Salabath Jung , and grandson Muzafur Jung ruled. They were never officially recognised[ by whom? ] as rulers. The seventh and last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan , fell from power when India annexed Hyderabad State in 1948 in Operation Polo . [5] Today, the title is held by his great grandson and pretender , Azmet Jah . [6]
History
The title Nizam comes from the Persian نظام /nɪˈzɑːm/, which itself is derived from Arabic niẓām which means ""order"" or ""arrangement"", and was typically given to high ranking state officials. [7]
Descent
[ edit ]
According to Sir Roper Lethbridge in The Golden Book of India (1893), the Nizams are lineally descended from the First Caliph Abu Bakr , the successor of the Islamic prophet Muhammed . [8] The family of Nizams in India is descended from Abid Khan , a Persian from Samarkand , whose lineage is traced to Sufi Shihab-ud-Din Suhrawardi (1154–91) of Suhraward in Iran. In the early 1650s, on his way to hajj , Abid Khan stopped in Deccan, where the young prince Aurangzeb , then Governor of Deccan, cultivated him. Abid Khan returned to the service of Aurangzeb to fight in the succession wars of 1657–58. After Aurangzeb's enthronement, Abid Khan was richly rewarded and became Aurangzeb's favourite nobleman. His son Ghazi Uddin Khan was married to Safiya Khanum, the daughter of the former imperial Grand Vizier (prime minister) Sa'dullah Khan . Mir Qamaruddin Khan , the founder of the line of Nizams, was born of the couple, thus descending from two prominent families of the Mughal court. [9]
Ghazi Uddin Khan rose to become a General of the Emperor Aurangzeb and played a vital role in conquering Bijapur and Golconda Sultanates of Southern India in 1686. [10] He also played a key role in thwarting the rebellion by Prince Akbar and alleged rebellion by Prince Mu`azzam . [11]
Map of India in 1760. Part of the southern area in green was ruled by the Nizam.
After Aurangzeb's death and during the war of succession, Qamaruddin and his father remained neutral thus escaping the risk of being on the losing side; they remained marginal players in the Mughal court during the reigns of Bahadur Shah I (1707–12) and Jahandar Shah (1712–13). Their successor Farrukhsiyar (1713–19) appointed Qamaruddin the governor of Deccan in 1713, awarding him the title Nizam-ul-Mulk. However, the governorship was taken away two years later and Qamaruddin withdrew to his estate in Moradabad . Under the next emperor, Muhammad Shah (1719–48), Qamaruddin accepted the governorship of Deccan for the second time in 1721. The next year, following the death of his uncle Muhammad Amin Khan, a power-broker in the Mughal Court, Qamaruddin returned to Delhi and was made the wazir (prime minister). According to historian Faruqui, his tenure as prime minister was undermined by his opponents and a rebellion in Deccan was engineered against him. In 1724, the Nizam returned to Deccan to reclaim his base, in the process making a transition to a semi-independent ruler. [12]
Reign
Further information: Hyderabad State
In 1724, Asaf Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the Deccan Suba, named the region Hyderabad Deccan , and started what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty . Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asaf Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad. [13] [14] Nizam I never formally declared independence from the Mughals; he still flew the Mughal flag, and was never crowned. In Friday prayers, the sermon would be conducted in the name of Aurangzeb, and this tradition continued until the end of Hyderabad State in 1948. The death of Asaf Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons, backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces, contended for the throne. The accession of Asif Jah II , who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768, he signed the treaty of Machilipatnam , surrendering the coastal region to the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent. [15]

Following the decline of the Mughal power, the region of Deccan saw the rise of the Maratha Empire . The titular Nizams themselves fought during the Mughal-Maratha Wars since the 1720s, which resulted in the Nizam paying a regular tax ( Chauth ) to the Marathas. The major battles fought between the Marathas and the Nizam include Palkhed , Bhopal , Rakshasbhuvan , and Kharda , in all of which the Nizam lost. [16] [17] Following the conquest of Deccan by Bajirao I and the imposition of Chauth by him, the Nizam essentially remained a tributary of the Marathas. [18]

In 1805, after the East India Company's victory in the Second Anglo-Maratha War , the Nizam of Hyderabad came under their protection.[ citation needed ]. In 1858, the state of Hyderabad became part of the British Indian Empire as a princely state with full autonomy albeit under colonial rule and was subject to the British Crown.
From 1876 to 1948, the Nizam recognised the Crown as paramount ruler of India as the monarch of the United Kingdom simultaneously held the title of emperor of India (first held by Queen Victoria as empress and the last being George VI as emperor)
In 1903, the Berar region of the state was separated and merged into the Central Provinces of British India , to form the Central Provinces and Berar .
During the Second World War , 80,000 men who were raised by the Nizam to form a personal army under the Indian State Forces , known as the 19th Hyderabad Regiment served in Malaya, North Africa, Persia, Singapore and Burma
The last Nizam of Hyderabad state, Mir Osman Ali Khan crowned in 1911, had been the richest man in the world in his time. [19] The Nizams developed the railway, introduced electricity, and developed roads, airways, irrigation and reservoirs; in fact, all major public buildings in Hyderabad City were built during his reign during the period of British rule in India . He pushed education, science, and the establishment of Osmania University forward.
In 1947, at the time of the partition of India , the British government offered the 565 princely states in the sub-continent the options of acceding to either India or Pakistan or remaining independent.

Atomic tourism

Tourism involving travel to nuclear sites
Tourists at ground zero, Trinity site.
Atomic tourism or nuclear tourism is a form of tourism in which visitors witness nuclear tests or learn about the Atomic Age by traveling to significant sites in atomic history such as nuclear test reactors, museums with nuclear weapon artifacts, delivery vehicles, sites where atomic weapons were detonated, and nuclear power plants . [1] [2]
In the United States, the Center for Land Use Interpretation has conducted tours of the Nevada Test Site , Trinity Site , Hanford Site , and other historical atomic age sites, to explore the cultural significance of these Cold War nuclear zones. The book Overlook: Exploring the Internal Fringes of America describes the purpose of this tourism as  ""windows into the American psyche, landmarks that manifest the rich ambiguities of the nation's cultural history."" [3] [4] [5] A Bureau of Atomic Tourism was proposed by American photographer Richard Misrach and writer Myriam Weisang Misrach in 1990. [6] [7]
Visitors to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone often visit the nearby deserted city of Pripyat . [1] The Hiroshima Peace Memorial (Genbaku Dome), which survived the destruction of Hiroshima , is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site at the center of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park . [8] Bikini Atoll was at one time the site of a diving tourism initiative. [9] As of 2012, China planned to build a tourist destination at its first atomic test site, the Malan Base at Lop Nur in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region . [10]
Several nuclear power plants offer tours of the facilities or provide education at visitor centers.
Nuclear tests
Mushroom cloud seen from downtown Las Vegas .
During the early atomic age fission was viewed as a sign of progress and modernity.
In this light Las Vegas became in the mid-1940s and early 1950s an original place of atomic tourism when nuclear tests were performed at Nevada Test Site . Seeing nuclear tests was advertised and viewings were hosted in Las Vegas at the time. [11] The city of Las Vegas and its Chamber of Commerce nicknamed Vegas as the ""Atomic City"" in an attempt to attract tourists. [12] [13] So called ""bomb viewing parties"" took place on desert hilltops, or more famously at the panoramic Sky Room at the Desert Inn , and casinos held Miss Atomic pageants while serving Atomic Cocktails .

Mountain railways of India
The Mountain railways of India are the railway lines that were built in the mountainous regions of India . The term mainly includes the narrow-gauge railways in these regions but may also include some broad-gauge railways.
Three of the lines, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway , the Nilgiri Mountain Railway , and the Kalka–Shimla Railway , are collectively designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name ""Mountain Railways of India"". Two more, the Matheran Hill Railway and the Kangra Valley Railway , are on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites . [1] [2] The Nilgiri Mountain Railway is also the only rack and pinion railway in India.
Mountain railways, such as the Jammu–Baramulla line and the Chota Char Dham Railway , are currently under construction, and others are in the planning stage, such as the Srinagar–Leh line and the Bhanupli–Leh line . All the mountain railways constructed in recent times use broad-gauge.
World Heritage Sites
[ edit ]
Three railways, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway , the Nilgiri Mountain Railway and the Kalka–Shimla Railway are collectively designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name Mountain Railways of India. The Matheran Hill Railway and Kangra Valley Railway are on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. [1] The basis of UNESCO's designation of the Mountain Railways of India as a World Heritage Site is ""outstanding examples of bold, ingenious engineering solutions for the problem of establishing an effective rail link through rugged, mountainous terrain."" [3] The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway received the honor first in 1999 by UNESCO followed by the Nilgiri Mountain Railway in 2005. The Kalka–Shimla Railway received the designation in 2008. The three routes together have been titled the Mountain Railways of India under UNESCO World Heritage Site criteria ii and iv, within the Asia-Pacific region. The Matheran Hill Railway, a fourth mountain line, has been nominated and is pending approval by the international body. [3] [4]
Darjeeling Himalayan Railway
A train on the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway
A Z reverse on the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway
The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway , with the nickname ""the Toy Train,"" is a 610 mm (2.00 ft) narrow-gauge railway that links the  88 km (55 mi) between Siliguri and Darjeeling . The latter is a major summer hill station and the centre of a flourishing tea-growing district located in West Bengal . The route is operated by Indian Railways ., and its elevation starts at 100 m (330 ft) in Siliguri and rises to about 2,200 m (7,200 ft) at Darjeeling. The highest elevation is at Ghoom station, 2,300 m (7,500 ft). [5] [6]
The town of Siliguri, the start of the railway route, was connected with Calcutta (now Kolkata) via railway in 1878, while the additional journey to Darjeeling required the use of tongas (horse-driven carts) along a dust track. On the recommendations of a committee appointed by Sir Ashley Eden , work on the route began in 1879 and was completed by July 1881. [5] [7] The line underwent several improvements such as making its gradients more gradual over the years to increase its manoeuvrability. By 1909–1910, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was carrying roughly 174,000 passengers and 47,000 tons of goods annually. [6]
Important features incorporated in the line include four loops ( spirals ) and four 'Z' reverses ( zigzags ). The introduction of bogie carriages allowed for the replacement of the basic four wheel carriages formerly used for support and stability. In 1897, a major earthquake damaged the railway, requiring rebuilding of the route, including extensive improvements to the track and stations. Further modernization occurred as part of the Northeast Frontier Railway Zone . Most trains on the route are still powered by steam engines , but a modern diesel engine is used for the Darjeeling Mail train. [5] [7] [8] The railway is notable for its signage located at key vantage points, marking locations with titles such as Agony Point and Sensation Corner. Another feature are spirals on steep hills that provide scenic views of the valleys below. [9] In 1999, the Darjeeling line was the first to be recognized by UNESCO and placed on the World Heritage List . A condition of being placed upon the list was that steam locomotives would continue to be used along the route. [3]
Nilgiri Mountain Railway
[ edit ]
A train on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway
The Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a 46 km (29 mi) metre gauge single-line railway. It connects the town of Mettupalayam with the hill station of Udagamandalam ( Ootacamund ). The route is located within the state of Tamil Nadu and travels through the Nilgiri Hills , which are popularly known as the Blue Mountains of Southern India . The Nilgiri is the only rack railway in India, and it uses an Abt rack system . The ABT system requires the use of special steam locomotives . The line contains 208 curves, 16 tunnels, and 250 bridges, causing the uphill journey along the route to take about 290 min (4.8 h), while the downhill journey takes 215 min (3.6 h). [9] [10] [11] The Nilgiri Mountain Railway was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2005. Initially, the town of Coonoor was the final station on the line, but in September 1908 it was extended to Fernhill followed by Udagmandalam by October 15, 1908. The system was described by Guilford Lindsey Molesworth in a report from 1886: [12]
Two distinct functions – first that of traction by adhesion as in an ordinary loco; second that of traction by pinions acting on the track bars. The brakes are four in number – two handbrakes, acting by friction; and two acting by preventing the free escape of air from cylinder and thus using compressed air in retarding the progress of the engine. The former are used for shunting while the later for descending steep gradients. One of the handbrakes acts on the tyres of the wheels in the ordinary manner and the second acts on grooved surfaces of the pinion axle, but can be used in those places where the rack is laid. [12]
A unique feature of the line, which is still fully operational, is that its oldest and steepest track uses rack and pinion technology. Currently, the line runs for 7.2 km (4.5 mi), up to the foothill station of Kallar , where the rack rail portion begins. The rack rail portion ends at Coonoor railway station . The longest tunnel of this section measures 97 m (318 ft). The route has a gradient of 1:12.5 up to Coonoor , and past Coonoor to the final station the track has a ruling gradient of 1:23. [9] [13]
Kalka–Shimla Railway
[ edit ]
Shivalik Deluxe Express on the Kalka–Shimla Railway
The Kalka–Shimla Railway runs between Kalka and Shimla. The railway is 95.66 km (59.44 mi) long, and its gauge is narrow 2 ft 6 in (762 mm). [13] Shimla is the modern capital of Himachal Pradesh [9] [14] and is at an elevation of 2,205 m (7,234 ft) in the foothills of the Himalayas. It became the summer capital of British India in 1864, and it also served as the headquarters of the British Army in India. [9] [14] Until the railway's construction, the only access to Shimla was by village cartway. The railway line was constructed by the Delhi–Ambala–Kalka Railway Company, beginning in 1898 in the Siwalik Hills , and was completed in 1903. The Kalka–Shimla Railway joined the Nilgiri and Darjeeling lines as a World Heritage Site in 2008. [3]
The Kalka–Shimla Railway has 103 tunnels and 864 bridges. Many of the bridges are multi-arched, reminiscent of Ancient Roman aqueducts , and one bridge, which spans 18.29 m (60.0 ft), is made with plate girders and steel trusses . Its ruling gradient is 1:33 or 3%, and it features 919 curves, with the sharpest at 48 degrees (a radius of 37.47 m (122.9 ft)). The tracks climb from 656 m (2,152 ft) to a peak elevation of 2,076 m (6,811 ft) at Shimla. The longest tunnel on the line is the Barog Tunnel (No. 33), which is 1,144 m (3,753 ft) long, connecting Dagshai and Solan . The loops at Taksal , Gumman, and Dharampur help to attain flatter gradients. [9]

History
[ edit ]
Kerala was a relatively unknown state among tourist circles until the early 1960s. The first initiative to popularize Kerala as a tourist destination was undertaken by Travancore 's Prince Consort Col. Godavarma Raja (husband of the then Queen of Travancore) started Kerala Tours Limited to popularize key tourist locations in Travancore Kingdom. When Travancore merged with India, Kerala Tours Limited became a private entity under the Travancore royal family. For more than 20 years since Independence, Kerala tended to ignore tourism as a key industry, leaving KTL and other private players to lead the role. In the 1960s, KTL struck gold, by collaborating with Thomas Cook and started popularizing Kovalam in western countries which started the advent of hippie culture in Kovalam Beach. The strong inflow of tourists into Kovalam, started Kerala government to consider tourism as a key industry. Though it tried to nationalize Kerala Tours Limited, it soon fell into legal issues. This resulted in the government to think starting a new entity known as Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) IN 1966. [1]
Started as a government department, KTDC became a separate commercial entity by the 1970s. Several premium guest houses of Kerala Government were identified and converted into hotel brands. Lt. Col. G. V. Raja was also the President of Tourism Promotion Council of Kerala. He was the main architect in developing Kovalam as an international tourist spot. [2] [3]
Objectives
To promote Kerala as a leading tourist destination
To identify key tourist destinations within Kerala and promote it outside
To provide auxiliary support in developing key tourist destinations
To provide highest quality hospitality services to tourists

To ensure higher returns to government, through financial and social viable projects, and thereby provide employment

Wellness tourism is voluntary travel to world-wide destinations for the purpose of promoting health and well-being through physical, psychological, or spiritual activities. [1]
Wellness tourism aims to control stress levels and promote a healthy lifestyle. Specific types of wellness tourism include meditation and multiple types of yoga, such as classical or exercise-based, as well as treatments that include conventional, alternative, complementary, herbal, or homeopathic medicine. These types of wellness tourism account for the global market growth of the industry and the impact and issues that are currently within the industry or will occur in the future.
Market
[ edit ]
In 2021, the global wellness tourism industry was valued at $850.55 billion and is expected to grow to $2.1 trillion by 2030. [2] [3]
The market primarily includes services like lodging, transportation, activities, and food and drink. [4] The lodging segment dominates these sectors as it accounted for about 23% of the revenue in 2022. [3] Visiting a spa has become more prevalent among tourists and mass luxury brands such as Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts , Aman Resorts , Oberoi Group , Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group , and Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company have rapidly incorporated house-brand spas into the leisure experience. Hotels may also gratify wellness tourists by housing third party spa operators, such as Clarins . [5]
North America is the biggest market of wellness tourism across the globe with a revenue share of about 40 percent as of 2022. [3] International tourism has the highest projected growth in the global industry with Europe as the second largest and the Asia Pacific as third. Extreme growth is expected from Asia, the Middle East/North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries that can offer unique ‘wellness’ experiences at much lower costs. [3] Within the US $3.4 trillion spa and wellness economy, wellness tourism is estimated to total US$494 billion or 14.6 percent of all 2013 domestic and international tourism expenditures. [6]
Wellness tourists are generally high-yield tourists, spending, on average, 130 percent more than the average tourist. [7] In 2020, international wellness tourists spent 35% more than the average international tourist; domestic wellness tourists spend about 177% more than the average domestic tourist. [8] Domestic wellness tourism is significantly larger than its international equivalent, representing 84 percent of wellness travel and 68 percent of expenditures (or $299 billion). International wellness tourism represents 16 percent of wellness travel and 32 percent of expenditures ($139 billion market). [9] Wellness tourists are generally wealthier and more willing to spend greater amounts of money on these types of experiences and services. [10]
The wellness tourism market includes primary and secondary wellness tourists. Primary wellness tourists travel entirely for wellness purposes while secondary wellness tourists engage in wellness-related activities as part of a trip. Secondary wellness tourists constitute the significant majority (92%) of total wellness tourism trips and expenditures (85 percent). [10]
Industry players
[ edit ]
Wellness travelers may seek procedures or treatments using conventional, alternative, complementary, herbal, or homeopathic medicine . [11] Advertisers may use the term wellness to promote a wide range of miscellaneous products and services. Players in wellness tourism may target healthy tourists who want to maintain and promote their health, or cure guests who want to recover from illness and seek healing of bodily ailments. Wellness tourism suffers from skepticism about the quality and effectiveness of the treatments and pursuits on offer. [12]
Individual wellness practitioners and programs provide diverse services such as beauty treatments , exercise opportunities, including physical fitness and sports, healthy diet and weight management , health-related education, and relaxation and stress relief methods in luxurious, privately rent resort centers, small hotels or sections of larger hotels themed for the purpose all over the world. [13]
Tourists doing yoga in Poon Hill , Nepal
Wellness travelers pursue these diverse services as a form of stress control. Popular relaxation methods used to control stress include spiritual tourism , including meditation and yoga , whether classical or as exercise ; Spiritual tourism is a growing practice that has evolved from a religious pilgrimage into traveling to a sacred spot in hopes of finding a special feeling. [14]
Cruise ships offering wellness programs including the use of on-board spas. [15] Day spas and destination spas offer short-term, residential programs to address specific health concerns, reduce stress, or support lifestyle improvement.
Destinations
The premises of Krinides mud baths in Macedonia , Greece
Wellness tourism is now an identifiable niche market in at least 30 countries. [16] Twenty countries accounted for 85 percent of global wellness tourism expenditures in 2012. The top five countries alone (United States, Germany, Japan, France, Austria) account for more than half the market (59 percent of expenditures). [6]
North America
[ edit ]
Gentlemen's Pool House, Jefferson Pools , Warm Springs, Virginia, built 1761 it is the oldest spa building in the United States
As of 2014, the US is the largest wellness tourism market, with $180.7 billion in annual, combined international and domestic expenditures. The US is the top destination for inbound international wellness tourism, with 7.1 million international, inbound trips. Europe and high-income Asian countries are primary sources of wellness tourists traveling to the US. [17]
Domestic tourism accounts for the majority (94 percent) of wellness trips in North America. Americans and Canadians receive—and take—few vacation days compared to workers in other countries making domestic, weekend trips the most popular wellness travel option. [18]
Europe
[ edit ]
Europe is the second largest wellness tourism market, with $158.4 billion in annual, combined international and domestic expenditures; the region ranks highest in number of wellness trips with 216.2 million, compared to North America's 171.7 in 2013. [6] Europeans have long believed in health benefits derived from mineral baths, saunas, thalassotherapy , and other natural and water-based treatments. Thermal resorts and hotels in Turkey and Hungary cater to wellness tourists, many of whom are subsidized by host countries such as Norway and Denmark seeking to mitigate costs of medical procedures for patients with chronic conditions requiring expensive surgeries. [19]
Asia-Pacific
The Oriental Spa in the Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok
The Asia-Pacific region ranks as the third largest with $6.4 billion in annual, combined international and domestic expenditures. [6] Ancient regional wellness traditions include Indian Ayurveda , Yoga , traditional Chinese medicine , Hilot , and Thai massage .
Latin America-Caribbean
[ edit ]
Latin America and the Caribbean is the fourth largest region for wellness tourism in terms of both the number of trips and expenditures. Domestic tourism accounts for approximately 71 percent of wellness tourism trips, and 54 percent of wellness tourism expenditures.
Middle East and Africa
[ edit ]
The Middle East and Africa currently represent the smallest regions for wellness tourism. The Middle East boasts a long tradition of bathing associated with Turkish baths , and some older facilities are being modernized to cater to spa-seeking tourists. Tourism is experiencing growth in the region, prompting governments and private developers to establish new facilities.
In Africa, wellness tourism is concentrated in a few regions such as South Africa and the Maghreb, and it is predominantly driven by international tourists.
Criticism
[ edit ]
Wellness tourism advocates suggest that vacations improve physical well-being, happiness, and productivity, citing that health-oriented trips give travelers a fresh perspective and positively affect creativity, resilience, problem solving, and capacity for coping with stress. [20] [21] Yet it is difficult to quantify the health benefits since many of the wellness practices are unregulated, and the growing industry negatively impacts the destinations that travelers flock to.
Quantifying Wellness
[ edit ]
One study found that sectors of the wellness industry including healthy eating, physical wellness, and mental resilience had little to no statistical relationship with indicating better health. [22] While these aspects of wellness are widely regarded to improve health outcomes, some believe that a higher level of spending in these areas does not actually improve health. [22] In these sectors, the offerings of Wellness Tourism experiences do not have a tangible impact on the overall health of the consumer.
Regulatory Issues
[ edit ]
Many Wellness Tourism practices are unregulated, and due to the breadth of countries and organizations in the industry, it is difficult to maintain standards across experiences. [23] Over 60% of retreats admitted to not engaging with regulations or certifications beside basic health and safety checks. [23] In many instances, safety cannot be guaranteed during wellness practices. There are several instances where tourists on ayahuasca retreats have died while under the influence of unregulated drugs. [24] There have also been instances of tourists dying in sweat lodges and incidents involving cults during meditation retreats. [23] There is also little regulation when it comes to employee training, and many retreat employees are only trained internally by their superiors. [25] With the lack of regulations, it is difficult for consumers to determine which retreats are safe.
Environmental Impact
[ edit ]
Another impact of tourism is the environmental impacts on the countries tourists flock to. As many wellness tourism destinations are developing countries, many of these countries are not equipped to handle the heavy influx of tourists surrounding the wellness industry. The draw of these locations is that they are remote: an escape from society. However, these remote locations lack the infrastructure to handle sewage, landfill, and enough natural resources to support tourists. [23] In 2016, over 1,500 wellness retreat locations in India admitted to dumping sewage directly into rivers, and Tulum faced similar issues. [23] Wellness tourism practices also destroy natural resources and habitats; with the rising fad of ayahuasca retreats, plants were depleted naturally and providers moved to farming them commercially, leading to deforestation to make room for fields.

List of menhirs
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The following is an alphabetical list of menhirs by subcontinents and nations.
This list is incomplete ; you can help by adding missing items . (September 2021)
Africa
[ edit ]
Ancient standing stones are found throughout the Horn of Africa . Several of these old menhirs exist in Qohaito , Eritrea , and date to a period before the founding of the Kingdom of Axum . The Axumites themselves also erected a number of large stelae , which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. One of these granite columns is the largest such structure in the world, standing at 90 feet. [1]
Pre- Axumite standing stones in Qohaito , Eritrea
In northeastern Somalia , on the coastal plain 20 km to Alula 's east are found ruins of an ancient monument in a platform style. The structure is formed by a rectangular drystone wall that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones are also positioned on the edifice's corners. Near the platform are graves, which are outlined in stones. 24 m by 17 m in dimension, the structure is the largest of a string of ancient platform and enclosed platform monuments exclusive to far northeastern Somalia. [2] Additionally, around 200 stone monuments (taalos) are found in the northeastern Botiala site, most of which consist of cairns . There are a number of rows of standing stones on the eastern side of the structures, which are similar to those at Salweyn , a great cairn-held situated close to Heis . Besides cairns, the Botiala area also features a few other drystone monuments. These include disc monuments with circular, ground-level features, as well as low, rectangular platform monuments. [3] Burial sites near Burao in the northwestern part of the country likewise feature a number of old stelae. [4]
Additionally, between Djibouti City and Loyada in Djibouti are a number of anthropomorphic and phallic stelae. The structures are associated with graves of rectangular shape flanked by vertical slabs, as also found in central Ethiopia . The Djibouti-Loyada stelae are of uncertain age, and some of them are adorned with a T-shaped emblem. [5]
In Ethiopia, the town of Tiya contains 36 menhirs (standing stones) or stelae. Of these, 32 are engraved with swords and other mysterious symbols. The ancient structures suggest the presence of a large, prehistoric burial complex. [6] The archaeological site was designated a World Heritage Site in 1980.

Menhirs are found all across India. They can be as tall as 20 to 14 feet (over 4.2 m), and several hundred smaller menhirs scattered all over the agricultural fields, mountains and various geographical areas. Rao and his team visited the menhir site in Telangana on the days of summer and winter solstice and equinox and found that particular rows of stones were aligned to the rising and setting sun on these days. ""This suggests the megalithic community here was aware of the solar trajectories,"" he said. [7]
In 2019, four menhirs and nearly 1,000 small and big dolmens were found in India at the Pothamala hills at the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. [8] In 2023, four menhirs of megalithic age were discovered near Melkote, Karnataka. [9]
Iran
[ edit ]
Menhirs in Iran are found in different villages and areas of East Azarbaijan Province, meshkin shahr (pirazmian) and Amlash and Deylaman areas in Gilan . A double menhir is also situated on Kharg Island in the Persian Gulf .
Menhirs are called Sang-Afrāsht (سنگ‌افراشت) in Persian , and there are different studies published in Iranian periodicals about the details of the Iranian menhirs, specially in the periodical ""Barrasiha-yi Tarikhi"" (Historical studies).

The Hebrew term for ""standing stone"" is masseba, pl. massebot (also written matseva, matsevot). The most famous examples are from the Canaanite High Place at Tel Gezer , comprising a straight row of ten stone stelae and a square stone basin, all erected simultaneously during the Middle Bronze Age . [10]
Indonesia

Menhirs are found in Indonesia, except for the easternmost tip, namely New Guinea , which are not found. One of the famous prehistoric sites in Indonesia, the Pahoman Site in Banten . At the Pahoman site there is a menhir stone which is strongly suspected of originating from the relics of Gunung Karang civilization which was inhabited by ancient Sundanese . [11] [12]

Europe

Numerous menhirs dot the lands across Armenia, where they are called vishapakar ( Armenian : Վիշապաքար). Vishap translates to ""dragon"" or ""serpent"" and kar translates to ""stone"". The stones are cigar-shaped, and are typically 10 to 20 feet (3.0 to 6.1 metres) tall. They are often found in the mountains near the sources of rivers or lakes. A large number of them have been carved in the shape of a fish. The earliest known vishapakar is thought to date from between the 18th to 16th centuries BC. An inscription in ancient Urartian cuneiform written upon a vishap at the temple of Garni shows that they were created prior to the Urartian Kingdom (pre-8th century).
Bulgaria
Several menhirs are known in Bulgaria : next to the museum in Haskovo , in the village of Ovcharovo, in the village of Pethocladentsi, in the village of Stegerovo, Staroseltsi village, in Strelcha. [13]
Czech Republic
[ edit ]
Kamenný pastýř near Klobuky , Czech Republic
A number of menhirs exist in the Czech Republic . There are about 40 real menhirs in the country, and dozens of stones which could also be menhirs. Others have been erected recently. The largest real menhir is Kamenný pastýř (""stony shepherd"") near Klobuky , with a height of 3.3 metres (10.8 ft). [14] Czech menhirs are probably the last outcrop of similar buildings in northern Germany. [15]
France

The Kerloas menhir, the tallest standing menhir in Brittany [16]
Brittany stands out in the distribution of menhirs by virtue of both the density of monuments and the diversity of types. The largest surviving menhir in the world is located in Locmariaquer , Brittany, and it is known as the Grand Menhir Brisé ( Great Broken Menhir ). Once nearly 20.6 m (68 ft) high, today, it lies fractured into four pieces, but it would have weighed near 330 tons when intact. It is placed third after the Thunder Stone in St. Petersburg and the Western Stone in the Western Wall as the heaviest object moved by humans without powered machinery.
A 4.5 meter menhir can be seen on the side of Le Mans Cathedral . It was moved there in 1778 when the dolmen it was associated with was destroyed.
Alignments of menhirs are common, the most famous being the Carnac stones in Brittany, where more than 3000 individual menhirs are arranged in four groups and arrayed in rows stretching across four kilometres. Each set is organised with the tallest stones at the western end and shorter ones at the eastern end. Some end with a semicircular cromlech , but many have since fallen or been destroyed. [17]
The second largest concentration of menhirs in France is at the Cham des Bondons, which is located on high open limestone plain in the granitic Cévennes . Today, the site is protected by the Parc National des Cévennes . From the time pastoralism was established, the site was kept open by controlled burning and grazing. [18]
On the island of Corsica, menhirs are found in Filitosa , a megalithic site in southern Corsica. The period of occupation spans from the end of the Neolithic era and the beginning of the Bronze Age, until around the Roman times in Corsica.
Ireland
Ireland is rich in menhirs, standing stones which are usually located in farmer's fields and are heavily worn due to poor weather conditions and exposure to livestock.
Italy
[ edit ]
Menhir in Sardinia
Menhirs are especially common in Sardinia . [19] It is possible to see at least 332 such standing stones on the island, [20] including especially elaborate ""statue-menhirs"" that show a human face at the top and other gendered symbols on the flat front sides. Over a hundred examples of this standardized type have been found, most of them around the village of Laconi . [20] In the Sardinian language they are known as perdas fittas or perdas lungas. [21]
Norway
Bauta discoveries in Norway by county
County
Østfold
140
Overall 1,176 menhirs are registered in Norway . The stones are often included as part of a tomb construction. The introduction to Snorre Sagas points out that it was the custom to ""burn all dead and raise monoliths for them"" and that this custom was maintained in Norway and Sweden for a long time. As a rule, each grave was marked with a single stone, but there were also instances where several stones were used, including the burial facility De fem dårlige jomfruer at Karmsundet in Rogaland , with five raised stones. It is especially prevalent in Østlandet to find several monoliths arranged in a circle. 
Sometimes standing stone monuments are unrelated to known graves. It may be that they served as boundary markers. These include several stones in Fana in Bergen Municipality that can be linked to an important historical boundary between Sunnhordland and Nordhordland , as it was in medieval times.
In Norway, standing stones usually dated to the Migration Period , the Viking Age or early Middle Ages .
Portugal
[ edit ]
In Portugal , there are also found several ancient menhirs. The highest concentration is in the Alentejo region. These include the menhirs of Meada , the largest of the Iberian Peninsula, Outeiro , Patalou and Barrocal . Among these megalithic structures is the great Almendres Menhir within the Almendres Cromlech complex near Évora .
Scandinavia
Frostatinget bautasten
In Scandinavia , menhirs are called bautasteiner or bautastenar and continued to be erected during the Pre-Roman Iron Age and later, usually over the ashes of the dead. They were raised both as solitary stones and in formations, such as the stone ships and few stone circles . Sometimes, they were raised only as commemoration to great people, a tradition which was continued as the runestones .
Frostating , with its seat at Tinghaugen in Frosta Municipality in Trøndelag county, was the site of an early Norwegian court. The site is represented by the Frostatinget bautasten .
The tradition was strongest in Bornholm , Gotland and Götaland and appears to have followed the Goths , during the 1st century, to the southern shore of the Baltic Sea , (now Northern Poland) where they are a characteristic of the Wielbark culture . [22] [23]
Scotland
Various menhirs have existed in Scotland. The Ravenswood standing stone is an extant one that is about 4000 years old.
Serbia
The graves of the ""Latins"" and the ""Jidovs"" near the village of Balwan ( Bovan ), north of Aleksinac in Serbia were marked by large boulders. [24]
Spain
[ edit ]
In Spain, menhirs associated with the western European megalithic industry are relatively unusual compared to dolmens , but still are common sights in the northern half of the country, where at least 500 menhirs have been reported. [25] They are particularly common in the Basque Country , Navarre , northern Burgos and Palencia , Cantabria , and the Pyrenees , where they are usually encountered standing alone or in small groups (cromlech) in elevated locations; the Arlobi menhir is one of the most recent examples of a menhir. In smaller numbers, but of great dimensions, some examples are located in Extremadura , very related to the menhirs of Portugal. Most of the menhirs in northern Spain appear to date back to the stone age; they are not usually associated with burials, but in at least one instance (the Menhir of Cuesta del Molino in Burgos ) burials dating at least 2000 years after the menhir was originally built have been found. [25]
In mediterranean Spain and, particularly the Balearic islands, megalithic structures consisting of standing stones such as the Taulas , but associated with Bronze Age and Iron Age cultures, are also common.
Sweden
[ edit ]
In Sweden menhirs were erected as markers for the graves of warriors until the 13th century. The following lines are taken from Snorri Sturluson 's introduction to his work Heimskringla :
As to funeral rites, the earliest age is called the Age of Burning; because all the dead were consumed by fire, and over their ashes were raised standing stones. For men of consequence a mound should be raised to their memory, and for all other warriors who had been distinguished for manhood a standing stone; which custom remained long after Odin's time. [26]
In the same work Snorri writes that the Swedes burned the corpse of their king Vanlade and raised a stone over his ashes by the River Skyt, one of the tributaries of the River Fyris :
The Swedes took his body and burned it at a river called Skytaa, where a standing stone was raised over him. [26]
The tradition is also mentioned in the Hávamál .
Switzerland
In the French-speaking canton of Vaud in Switzerland , several menhirs form linear patterns in Yverdon-les-Bains . These are situated in Clendy and date back to the third millennium BC.

Western Chalukya Empire - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Chalukya_Empire,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
10th–12th century empire in western Deccan, South India
This article is about the Western Chalukya Empire. For other dynasties, see Chalukya (disambiguation) .
Western Chalukya Empire
Greatest extent of the Western Chalukya Empire, 1121 AD [2]
Status
Seuna (Yadava) dynasty
The Western Chalukya Empire ( /tʃəˈluːkjə/ chə-LOO-kyə ) ruled most of the western Deccan , South India , between the 10th and 12th centuries. This Kannada -speaking dynasty is sometimes called the Kalyani Chalukya after its regal capital at Kalyani, today's Basavakalyan in the modern Bidar district of Karnataka state, and alternatively the Later Chalukya from its theoretical relationship to the 6th-century Chalukya dynasty of Badami . The dynasty is called Western Chalukyas to differentiate from the contemporaneous Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi , a separate dynasty. Before the rise of these Chalukyas, the Rashtrakuta Empire of Manyakheta controlled most of the Deccan Plateau and Central India for over two centuries. In 973, seeing confusion in the Rashtrakuta empire after a successful invasion of their capital by the ruler of the Paramara dynasty of Malwa , Tailapa II , a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta dynasty ruling from Bijapur region defeated his overlords and made Manyakheta his capital. The dynasty quickly rose to power and grew into an empire under Someshvara I who moved the capital to Kalyani.
For over a century, the two empires of South India, the Western Chalukyas and the Chola dynasty of Thanjavur fought many fierce wars to control the fertile region of Vengi . During these conflicts, the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, distant cousins of the Western Chalukyas but related to the Cholas by marriage, took sides with the Cholas further complicating the situation. During the rule of Vikramaditya VI , in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, the Western Chalukyas convincingly contended with the Cholas and reached a peak, ruling territories that spread over most of the Deccan, between the Narmada River in the north and Kaveri River in the south. [3] [4] [5] [6] His exploits were not limited to the south for even as a prince, during the rule of Someshvara I, he had led successful military campaigns as far east as modern Bihar and Bengal . [7] [8] [9] During this period the other major ruling families of the Deccan, the Hoysala Empire , the Seuna dynasty , the Kakatiya dynasty and the Kalachuris of Kalyani , were subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only when the power of the Chalukya waned during the later half of the 12th century.
The Western Chalukya architecture known today as a transitional style, an architectural link between the style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the later Hoysala Empire. Most of its monuments are in the districts bordering the Tungabhadra River in central Karnataka. Well known examples are the Kasivisvesvara Temple, Lakkundi , the Mallikarjuna Temple, Kuruvatti , the Kalleshvara Temple, Bagali and the Mahadeva Temple, Itagi . This was an important period in the development of fine arts in South India, especially in literature, as the Western Chalukya kings encouraged writers in their native language Kannada and in Sanskrit .
History
[ edit ]
Old Kannada inscription dated 1028 AD from the rule of King Jayasimha II at the Praneshvara temple in Talagunda , Shivamogga district
Old Kannada inscription dated 1057 AD of King Someshvara I at Kalleshwara Temple, Hire Hadagali in Bellary district
Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in Koppal district , Karnataka
Knowledge of Western Chalukya history has come through examination of the numerous Kannada language inscriptions left by the kings (scholars Sheldon Pollock and Jan Houben have claimed 90 percent of the Chalukyan royal inscriptions are in Kannada), [10] [11] and from the study of important contemporary literary documents in Western Chalukya literature such as Gada Yuddha (982 CE) in Kannada by Ranna and Vikramankadeva Charitam (1120) in Sanskrit by Bilhana . [12] [13] The earliest record is dated 957, during the rule of Tailapa II when the Western Chalukyas were still a feudatory of the Rashtrakutas and Tailapa II governed from Tardavadi in present-day Bijapur district , Karnataka . [14] [15] The genealogy of the kings of this empire is still debated. One theory, based on contemporary literary and inscriptional evidence plus the finding that the Western Chalukyas employed titles and names commonly used by the early Chalukyas, suggests that the Western Chalukya kings belonged to the same family line as the illustrious Chalukya dynasty of the sixth century, [16] [17] while other Western Chalukya inscriptional evidence indicates they were a distinct line unrelated to the early Chalukyas. [18]
The records suggests a possible rebellion by a local Chalukya King, Chattigadeva of Banavasi province (c. 967), in alliance with local Kadamba chieftains. This rebellion however was unfruitful but paved the way for his successor Tailapa II. [19] A few years later, Tailapa II re-established Chalukya rule and defeated the Rashtrakutas during the reign of Karka II by timing his rebellion to coincide with the confusion caused in the Rashtrakuta capital of Manyakheta by the invading Paramaras of Central India in 973. [20] [21] After overpowering the Rashtrakutas, Tailapa II moved his capital to Manyakheta and consolidated the Chalukya empire in the western Deccan by subjugating the Paramara and other aggressive rivals and extending his control over the land between the Narmada River and Tungabhadra River. [22] However, some inscriptions indicate that Balagamve in Mysore territory may have been a power centre up to the rule of Someshvara I in 1042. [23]
The intense competition between the kingdom of the western Deccan and those of the Tamil country came to the fore in the 11th century over the acutely contested fertile river valleys in the doab region of the Krishna and Godavari River called Vengi (modern coastal Andhra Pradesh ). The Western Chalukyas and the Chola dynasty fought many bitter wars over control of this strategic resource. The imperial Cholas gained power during the time of the famous king Rajaraja Chola I and the crown prince Rajendra Chola I . Chola Emperor Rajaraja Chola I conquered parts of Chalukya territory in present-day Southern Karnataka by subjugating the Western Ganga dynasty of Gangavadi . The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi were cousins of the Western Chalukyas but became increasingly influenced by the Cholas through their marital ties with the Tamil kingdom. As this was against the interests of the Western Chalukyas, they wasted no time in involving themselves politically and militarily in Vengi. When King Satyashraya succeeded Tailapa II to the throne, he was able to protect his kingdom from Chola aggression as well as his northern territories in Konkan and Gujarat although his control over Vengi was shaky. In 1007 Chola crown-prince Rajendra Chola I invaded Western Chalukyas and had a battle with Western Chalukya Emperor Satyashraya at Donur in Bijapur district of Karnataka. According to an inscription of Satyasraya from Dharwad, Rajaraja Nittavinoda Rajendra Vidyadhara, ornament of the Chola race, Nurmudi-Chola (one-hundred-crown Chola) invaded the Western Chalukya Empire in 1007 AD with an army of 900,000 soldiers, carrying fire and sword throughout the region. The invading troops advanced as far as Donur in Bijapur district on their way to the Chalukya capital Manyakheta, where they were met by the Chalukya army under Satyashraya. The Tanjore big temple inscriptions and Hottur inscriptions state that Rajendra Chola I destroyed the Western Chalukya capital. The result of the battle was Cholas conquered Gangapadi and Nolambapadi. Satyashraya's successor, Jayasimha II , fought many battles with the Cholas in the south around c. 1020–21 when both these powerful kingdoms struggled to choose the Vengi king. [24] [25] Shortly thereafter in c. 1024, Jayasimha II subdued the Paramara of central India and the rebellious Yadava King Bhillama. [24]
e
It is known from records that Jayasimha's son Someshvara I , whose rule historian Sen considers a brilliant period in the Western Chalukya rule, moved the Chalukya capital to Kalyani in c. 1042. [26] [27] Hostilities with the Cholas continued while both sides won and lost battles, though neither lost significant territory [28] [29] during the ongoing struggle to install a puppet on the Vengi throne. In 1066, Vikramaditya VI, Son of Someshwara I had invaded the Chola Empire penetrating as far as the capital Gangaikonda Cholapuram and threatening the city before being repulsed by Cholas. [27] [30] [31] In the Battle of Vijayawada which was fought in 1068 between Someshvara I and Chola Emperor Virarajendra Chola , Someshwara I and his son Vikramaditya VI suffered defeat and lost Vengi to the Cholas. After the battle, Someshwara I due to incurable illness drowned himself in the Tungabhadra River (Paramayoga). [32] [33] [34] Despite many conflicts with the Cholas in the south, Someshvara I had managed to maintain control over the northern territories in Konkan, Gujarat, Malwa and Kalinga during his rule. His successor, his eldest son Someshvara II , feuded with his younger brother, Vikramaditya VI , an ambitious warrior who had initially been governor of Gangavadi in the southern Deccan when Someshvara II was the king. Before 1068, even as a prince, Vikramaditya VI had invaded Bengal , weakening the ruling Pala Empire . These incursions led to the establishment of Karnata dynasties such as the Sena dynasty and Varman dynasty in Bengal, and the Nayanadeva dynasty in Bihar. [7] [8] [9] At the death of Someshvara I in April 1068, his son Someshvara II succeeded him as the king of Chalukya. A dispute broke out between him and his younger brother soon after, resulting in a civil war between the two over control of the empire, with the brother proclaiming himself Vikramaditya VI of Western Chalukya. Vikramditya's request for assistance to king Virarajendra Chola was well received, with Virarajendra later recording that he recognised Vikramaditya VI as the king of Western Chalukya. Virarajendra married his daughter to Vikramaditya VI and forged an alliance with him, halting the long feud between the two empires. Vikramaditya VI won the loyalty of the Chalukya feudatories: the Hoysala, the Seuna and the Kadambas of Hangal. In 1075 Vikramaditya overthrew Someshawara II and became the Western Chalukya Emperor. From 1075 to 1076, during the Chola reign of Kulottunga I , the war began with the incursion of the Vikaramaditya's forces into the Chola territories and the two armies met in the Kolar district. What followed was the Chola counter-attack popularly known as the Nangili episode. In the ensuing battle, the Chalukyan army was completely routed and chased by the Chola forces from the rocky roads of Nangili all the way to the Tungabhadra via Manalur. Vikramaditya is said to have retreated hastily and fled. [35] [36]
The fifty-year reign of Vikramaditya VI, the most successful of the later Chalukya rulers, was an important period in Karnataka's history and is referred to by historians as the ""Chalukya Vikrama era"". [37] [38] [39] Not only was he successful in controlling his powerful feudatories in the north (Kadamba Jayakesi II of Goa, Silhara Bhoja and the Yadava King) and south (Hoysala Vishnuvardhana), he successfully dealt with the imperial Cholas whom he defeated in the battle of Vengi in 1093 and again in 1118. He retained this territory for many years despite ongoing hostilities with the Cholas. [3] [4] [5] [6] This victory in Vengi reduced the Chola influence in the eastern Deccan and made him emperor of territories stretching from the Kaveri River in the south to the Narmada River in the north, earning him the titles Permadideva and Tribhuvanamalla (lord of three worlds). The scholars of his time paid him glowing tributes for his military leadership, interest in fine arts and religious tolerance. [40] [41] Literature proliferated and scholars in Kannada and Sanskrit adorned his court. Poet Bilhana, who immigrated from far away Kashmir , eulogised the king in his well-known work Vikramankadeva Charita. [42] [43] Vikramaditya VI was not only an able warrior but also a devout king as indicated by his numerous inscriptions that record grants made to scholars and centers of religion. [44] [45]

The continual warring with the Cholas exhausted both empires, giving their subordinates the opportunity to rebel. [45] [49] In the decades after Vikramaditya VI's death in 1126, the empire steadily decreased in size as their powerful feudatories expanded in autonomy and territorial command. [45] [50] The time period between 1150 and 1200 saw many hard fought battles between the Chalukyas and their feudatories who were also at war with each other. By the time of Jagadhekamalla II , the Chalukyas had lost control of Vengi and his successor, Tailapa III , was defeated by the Kakatiya king Prola in 1149. [50] Tailapa III was taken captive and later released bringing down the prestige of the Western Chalukyas. Seeing decadence and uncertainty seeping into Chalukya rule, the Hoysalas and Seunas also encroached upon the empire. Hoysala Narasimha I defeated and killed Tailapa III but was unable to overcome the Kalachuris, who vied for control over the same region. In 1157 the Kalachuris of Kalyanis under Bijjala II captured Kalyani and occupied it for the next twenty years, forcing the Chalukyas to move their capital to Annigeri , located in the present day Dharwad district . [50] [51]
The Kalachuris were originally immigrants into the southern Deccan from central India and called themselves Kalanjarapuravaradhisavaras. [52] Bijjala II and his ancestors had governed as Chalukya commanders (Mahamandaleshwar) over the Karhad-4000 and Tardavadi-1000 provinces (overlapping region in present-day Karnataka and Maharashtra) with Mangalavada [53] or Annigeri [54] as their capital. Bijjala II's Chikkalagi record of 1157 calls him Mahabhujabala Chakravarti (""emperor with powerful shoulders and arms"") indicating he no longer was a subordinate of the Chalukyas. [53] However the successors of Bijjala II were unable to hold on to Kalyani and their rule ended in 1183 when the last Chalukya scion, Someshvara IV , made a final bid to regain control of the empire by recapturing Kalyani. [51] [54] Kalachuri King Sankama was killed by Chalukya general Narasimha in this conflict. [55] [56] During this time, Hoysala Veera Ballala II was growing ambitious and clashed on several occasions with the Chalukyas and the other claimants over their empire. He defeated Chalukya Someshvara IV and Seuna Bhillama V bringing large regions in the Krishna River valley under the Hoysala domains, but was unsuccessful against Kalachuris. [57] The Seunas under Bhillama V were on an imperialistic expansion too when the Chalukyas regained Kalyani. Their ambitions were temporarily stemmed by their defeat against Chalukya general Barma in 1183 but they later had their vengeance in 1189. [58]
The overall effort by Someshvara IV to rebuild the Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Someshvara IV into exile in Banavasi 1189. After the fall of the Chalukyas, the Seunas and Hoysalas continued warring over the Krishna River region in 1191, each inflicting a defeat on the other at various points in time. [59] This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western Deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire. [60]
Administration
[ edit ]

The Western Chalukya kingship was hereditary, passing to the king's brother if the king did not have a male heir. The administration was highly decentralised and feudatory clans such as the Alupas , the Hoysalas, the Kakatiya, the Seuna, the southern Kalachuri and others were allowed to rule their autonomous provinces, paying an annual tribute to the Chalukya emperor. [61] Excavated inscriptions record titles such as Mahapradhana (Chief minister), Sandhivigrahika, and Dharmadhikari (chief justice). Some positions such as Tadeyadandanayaka (commander of reserve army) were specialised in function while all ministerial positions included the role of Dandanayaka (commander), showing that cabinet members were trained as army commanders as well as in general administrative skills. [62]
The kingdom was divided into provinces such as Banavasi-12000, Nolambavadi-32000, Gangavadi-96000, each name including the number of villages under its jurisdiction. The large provinces were divided into smaller provinces containing a lesser number of villages, as in Belavola-300. The big provinces were called Mandala and under them were Nadu further divided into Kampanas (groups of villages) and finally a Bada (village). A Mandala was under a member of the royal family, a trusted feudatory or a senior official. Tailapa II himself was in charge of Tardavadi province during the Rashtrakuta rule. Chiefs of Mandalas were transferable based on political developments. For example, an official named Bammanayya administered Banavasi-12000 under King Someshvara III but was later transferred to Halasige-12000. Women from the royal family also administered Nadus and Kampanas. Army commanders were titled Mahamandaleshwaras and those who headed a Nadu were entitled Nadugouvnda. [63]
The Western Chalukyas minted punch-marked gold pagodas with Kannada and Nagari legends [64] which were large, thin gold coins with several varying punch marks on the obverse side. They usually carried multiple punches of symbols such as a stylised lion, Sri in Kannada, [65] a spearhead, the king's title, a lotus and others. Jayasimha II used the legend Sri Jaya, Someshvara I issued coins with Sri Tre lo ka malla, Someshvara II used Bhuvaneka malla, Lakshmideva's coin carried Sri Lasha, and Jagadhekamalla II coinage had the legend Sri Jagade. The Alupas, a feudatory, minted coins with the Kannada and Nagari legend Sri Pandya Dhanamjaya. [66] Lakkundi in Gadag district and Sudi in Dharwad district were the main mints (Tankhashaley). Their heaviest gold coin was the Gadyanaka, weighing 96 grains . Other coins included the Dramma (65 grains), the Kalanju (48 grains), the Kasu (15 grains), the Manjadi (2.5 grains), the Akkam (1.25 grains), and the Pana (9.6 grains). [67]
Economy
[ edit ]

Agriculture was the empire's main source of income through taxes on land and produce. The majority of the people lived in villages and worked farming the staple crops of rice , pulses , and cotton in the dry areas and sugarcane in areas having sufficient rainfall, with areca and betel being the chief cash crops. The living conditions of the labourers who farmed the land must have been bearable as there are no records of revolts by the landless against wealthy landlords. If peasants were disgruntled the common practice was to migrate in large numbers out of the jurisdiction of the ruler who was mistreating them, thereby depriving him of revenue from their labor. [68]
Taxes were levied on mining and forest products, and additional income was raised through tolls for the use of transportation facilities. The state also collected fees from customs, professional licenses, and judicial fines. [69] Records show horses and salt were taxed as well as commodities (gold, textiles, perfumes) and agricultural produce (black pepper, paddy, spices, betel leaves, palm leaves, coconuts and sugar). Land tax assessment was based on frequent surveys evaluating the quality of land and the type of produce. Chalukya records specifically mention black soil and red soil lands in addition to wetland, dry land and wasteland in determining taxation rates. [70]
e
Key figures mentioned in inscriptions from rural areas were the Gavundas (officials) or Goudas . The Gavundas belonged to two levels of economic strata, the Praja Gavunda (people's Gavunda) and the Prabhu Gavunda (lord of Gavundas). They served the dual purpose of representing the people before the rulers as well as functioning as state appointees for tax collection and the raising of militias. They are mentioned in inscriptions related to land transactions, irrigation maintenance, village tax collection and village council duties. [71]
The organisation of corporate enterprises became common in the 11th century. [72] Almost all arts and crafts were organised into guilds and work was done on a corporate basis; records do not mention individual artists, sculptors and craftsman. Only in the regions ruled by the Hoysala did individual sculptors etched their names below their creations. [73] Merchants organised themselves into powerful guilds that transcended political divisions, allowing their operations to be largely unaffected by wars and revolutions. Their only threat was the possibility of theft from brigands when their ships and caravans traveled to distant lands. Powerful South Indian merchant guilds included the Manigramam , the Nagarattar and the Anjuvannam . Local guilds were called nagaram, while the Nanadesis were traders from neighbouring kingdoms who perhaps mixed business with pleasure. The wealthiest and most influential and celebrated of all South Indian merchant guilds was the self-styled Ainnurruvar , also known as the 500 Svamis of Ayyavolepura ( Brahmins and Mahajanas of present-day Aihole ), [74] [75] who conducted extensive land and sea trade and thereby contributed significantly to the total foreign trade of the empire. It fiercely protected its trade obligations (Vira Bananjudharma or law of the noble merchants) and its members often recorded their achievements in inscriptions ( prasasti ). Five hundred such excavated Prasasti inscriptions, with their own flag and emblem, the bull, record their pride in their business.
Rich traders contributed significantly to the king's treasury through paying import and export taxes. The edicts of the Aihole Svamis mention trade ties with foreign kingdoms such as Chera , Pandya , Maleya ( Malaysia ), Magadh , Kaushal , Saurashtra , Kurumba, Kambhoja ( Cambodia ), Lata ( Gujarat ), Parasa ( Persia ) and Nepal . Travelling both land and sea routes, these merchants traded mostly in precious stones, spices and perfumes, and other specialty items such as camphor. Business flourished in precious stones such as diamonds, lapis lazuli , onyx , topaz , carbuncles and emeralds . Commonly traded spices were cardamom, saffron, and cloves, while perfumes included the by-products of sandalwood, bdellium , musk, civet and rose. These items were sold either in bulk or hawked on streets by local merchants in towns. [76] The Western Chalukyas controlled most of South India's west coast and by the 10th century they had established extensive trade ties with the Tang Empire of China , the empires of Southeast Asia and the Abbasid Caliphate in Bhagdad , and by the 12th-century Chinese fleets were frequenting Indian ports. Exports to Song dynasty China included textiles, spices, medicinal plants, jewels, ivory, rhino horn, ebony and camphor. The same products also reached ports in the west such as Dhofar and Aden . The final destinations for those trading with the west were Persia, Arabia and Egypt. [77] The thriving trade center of Siraf , a port on the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf, served an international clientele of merchants including those from the Chalukya empire who were feasted by wealthy local merchants during business visits. An indicator of the Indian merchants' importance in Siraf comes from records describing dining plates reserved for them. [78] In addition to this, Siraf received aloe wood, perfumes, sandalwood and condiments. The most expensive import to South India were Arabian horse shipments, this trade being monopolised by Arabs and local Brahmin merchants. Traveller Marco Polo , in the 13th century, recorded that the breeding of horses never succeeded in India due to differing climatic, soil and grassland conditions. [77]
Culture

The fall of the Rashtrakuta empire to the Western Chalukyas in the 10th century, coinciding with the defeat of the Western Ganga dynasty by the Cholas in Gangavadi , was a setback to Jainism . The growth of Virashaivism in the Chalukya territory and Vaishnava Hinduism in the Hoysala region paralleled a general decreased interest in Jainism, although the succeeding kingdoms continued to be religiously tolerant. [79] Two locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory continued to be patronaged, Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli . The decline of Buddhism in South India had begun in the 8th century with the spread of Adi Shankara 's Advaita philosophy. [80] The only places of Buddhist worship that remained during the Western Chalukya rule were at Dambal and Balligavi . [81] There is no mention of religious conflict in the writings and inscriptions of the time, suggesting that the religious transition was smooth.
Although the origin of the Virashaiva faith has been debated, the movement grew through its association with Basavanna in the 12th century. [82] [83] Basavanna and other Virashaiva saints preached of a faith without a caste system . In his Vachanas (a form of poetry), Basavanna appealed to the masses in simple Kannada and wrote ""work is worship"" (Kayakave Kailasa). Also known as the Lingayats (worshipers of the Linga, the universal symbol of Shiva), these Virashaivas questioned many of the established norms of society such as the belief in rituals and the theory of rebirth and supported the remarriage of widows and the marriage of unwed older women. [84] This gave more social freedom to women but they were not accepted into the priesthood. Ramanujacharya , the head of the Vaishnava monastery in Srirangam , traveled to the Hoysala territory and preached the way of devotion ( bhakti marga ). He later wrote Sribhashya, a commentary on Badarayana Brahmasutra , a critique on the Advaita philosophy of Adi Shankara. [85] Ramanujacharya's stay in Melkote resulted in the Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana converting to Vaishnavism, a faith that his successors also followed.
The impact of these religious developments on the culture, literature, and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of metaphysics and poetry based on the teachings of these philosophers were written over the next centuries. Akka Mahadevi , Allama Prabhu , and a host of Basavanna's followers, including Chenna Basava, Prabhudeva, Siddharama, and Kondaguli Kesiraja wrote hundreds of poems called Vachanas in praise of Lord Shiva . [86] The esteemed scholars in the Hoysala court, Harihara and Raghavanka , were Virashaivas. [87] This tradition continued into the Vijayanagar empire with such well-known scholars as Singiraja, Mallanarya, Lakkana Dandesa and other prolific writers of Virashaiva literature. [88] [89] The Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of the Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanujacharya exists today in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara. [90] Scholars in the succeeding Mysore Kingdom wrote Vaishnavite works supporting the teachings of Ramanujacharya. [91] King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism. [92]
Society

The rise of Veerashaivaism was revolutionary and challenged the prevailing Hindu caste system which retained royal support. The social role of women largely depended on their economic status and level of education in this relatively liberal period. Freedom was more available to women in the royal and affluent urban families. Records describe the participation of women in the fine arts, such as Chalukya queen Chandala Devi's and Kalachuris of Kalyani queen Sovala Devi's skill in dance and music. The compositions of thirty Vachana women poets included the work of the 12th-century Virashaiva mystic Akka Mahadevi whose devotion to the bhakti movement is well known. [93] Contemporary records indicate some royal women were involved in administrative and martial affairs such as princess Akkadevi, (sister of King Jayasimha II) who fought and defeated rebellious feudals. [94] [95] Inscriptions emphasise public acceptance of widowhood indicating that Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow used to immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre ) though present was on a voluntary basis. [96] Ritual deaths to achieve salvation were seen among the Jains who preferred to fast to death ( Sallekhana ), while people of some other communities chose to jump on spikes (Shoolabrahma) or walking into fire on an eclipse.
In a Hindu caste system that was conspicuously present, Brahmins enjoyed a privileged position as providers of knowledge and local justice. These Brahmins were normally involved in careers that revolved around religion and learning with the exception of a few who achieved success in martial affairs. They were patronised by kings, nobles and wealthy aristocrats who persuaded learned Brahmins to settle in specific towns and villages by making them grants of land and houses. The relocation of Brahmin scholars was calculated to be in the interest of the kingdom as they were viewed as persons detached from wealth and power and their knowledge was a useful tool to educate and teach ethical conduct and discipline in local communities. Brahmins were also actively involved in solving local problems by functioning as neutral arbiters (Panchayat). [97]
Regarding eating habits, Brahmins, Jains, Buddhists and Shaivas were strictly vegetarian while the partaking of different kinds of meat was popular among other communities. Marketplace vendors sold meat from domesticated animals such as goats, sheep, pigs and fowl as well as exotic meat including partridge, hare, wild fowl and boar. [98] People found indoor amusement by attending wrestling matches (Kusti) or watching animals fight such as cock fights and ram fights or by gambling. Horse racing was a popular outdoor pastime. [99] In addition to these leisurely activities, festivals and fairs were frequent and entertainment by traveling troupes of acrobats, dancers, dramatists and musicians was often provided. [100]
Schools and hospitals are mentioned in records and these were built in the vicinity of temples. Marketplaces served as open air town halls where people gathered to discuss and ponder local issues. Choirs, whose main function was to sing devotional hymns, were maintained at temple expense. Young men were trained to sing in choirs in schools attached to monasteries such as Hindu Matha , Jain Palli and Buddhist Vihara . [101] These institutions provided advanced education in religion and ethics and were well equipped with libraries (Saraswati Bhandara). Learning was imparted in the local language and in Sanskrit. Schools of higher learning were called Brahmapuri (or Ghatika or Agrahara). Teaching Sanskrit was a near monopoly of Brahmins who received royal endowments for their cause. Inscriptions record that the number of subjects taught varied from four to eighteen. [102] The four most popular subjects with royal students were Economics (Vartta), Political Science (Dandaniti), Veda (trayi) and Philosophy ( Anvikshiki ), subjects that are mentioned as early as Kautilyas Arthashastra .
Literature
Main article: Western Chalukya literature in Kannada
Grill work at Tripurantkesvara temple in Balligavi, Shimoga district
The Western Chalukya era was one of substantial literary activity in the native Kannada, and Sanskrit. [103] In a golden age of Kannada literature, [104] Jain scholars wrote about the life of Tirthankaras and Virashaiva poets expressed their closeness to God through pithy poems called Vachanas . Nearly three hundred contemporary Vachanakaras (Vachana poets) including thirty women poets have been recorded. [105] [106] Early works by Brahmin writers were on the epics, Ramayana , Mahabharata , Bhagavata , Puranas and Vedas . In the field of secular literature, subjects such as romance, erotics, medicine, lexicon, mathematics, astrology, encyclopedia etc. were written for the first time. [107] [108]
Most notable among Kannada scholars were Ranna , grammarian Nagavarma II , minister Durgasimha and the Virashaiva saint and social reformer Basavanna . Ranna who was patronised by king Tailapa II and Satyashraya is one among the ""three gems of Kannada literature"". [109] He was bestowed the title ""Emperor among poets"" (Kavi Chakravathi) by King Tailapa II and has five major works to his credit. Of these, Saahasabheema Vijayam (or Gada yuddha) of 982 in Champu style is a eulogy of his patron King Satyashraya whom he compares to Bhima in valour and achievements and narrates the duel between Bhima and Duryodhana using clubs on the eighteenth day of the Mahabharata war . [110] He wrote Ajitha purana in 993 describing the life of the second Tirthankara , Ajitanatha. [111] [112]
Nagavarma II, poet laureate (Katakacharya) of King Jagadhekamalla II made contributions to Kannada literature in various subjects. [113] [114] His works in poetry, prosody, grammar and vocabulary are standard authorities and their importance to the study of Kannada language is well acknowledged. Kavyavalokana in poetics, Karnataka-Bhashabhushana on grammar and Vastukosa a lexicon (with Kannada equivalents for Sanskrit words) are some of his comprehensive contributions. [115] Several works on medicine were produced during this period. Notable among them were Jagaddala Somanatha's Karnataka Kalyana Karaka. [116]
A popular Vachana poem in the Kannada language by Akka Mahadevi
A unique and native form of poetic literature in Kannada called Vachanas developed during this time. They were written by mystics, who expressed their devotion to God in simple poems that could appeal to the masses. Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi , Allama Prabhu , Channabasavanna and Siddharama are the best known among them. [117]
In Sanskrit, a well-known poem ( Mahakavya ) in 18 cantos called Vikramankadeva Charita by Kashmiri poet Bilhana recounts in epic style the life and achievements of his patron king Vikramaditya VI. The work narrates the episode of Vikramaditya VI's accession to the Chalukya throne after overthrowing his elder brother Someshvara II. [118] The great Indian mathematician Bhāskara II (born c. 1114) flourished during this time. From his own account in his famous work Siddhanta Siromani (c. 1150, comprising the Lilavati, Bijaganita on algebra, Goladhaya on the celestial globe and Grahaganita on planets) Bijjada Bida (modern Bijapur ) was his native place. [119]
Manasollasa or Abhilashitartha Chintamani by king Someshvara III (1129) was a Sanskrit work intended for all sections of society. This is an example of an early encyclopedia in Sanskrit covering many subjects including medicine, magic, veterinary science, valuing of precious stones and pearls, fortifications, painting, music, games, amusements etc. [120] While the book does not give any of dealt topics particular hierarchy of importance, it serves as a landmark in understanding the state of knowledge in those subjects at that time. [121] Someshwara III also authored a biography of his famous father Vikramaditya VI called Vikraman-Kabhyudaya. The text is a historical prose narrative which also includes a graphic description of the geography and people of Karnataka . [122]
A Sanskrit scholar Vijnaneshwara became famous in the field of legal literature for his Mitakshara , in the court of Vikramaditya VI. Perhaps the most acknowledged work in that field, Mitakshara is a treatise on law (commentary on Yajnavalkya) based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of modern India. An Englishman Colebrooke later translated into English the section on inheritance giving it currency in the British Indian court system. [123] Some important literary works of the time related to music and musical instruments were Sangita Chudamani, Sangita Samayasara and Sangita Ratnakara. [124]
Architecture
Main article: Western Chalukya architecture

The reign of Western Chalukya dynasty was an important period in the development of Deccan architecture. The architecture designed during this time served as a conceptual link between the Badami Chalukya architecture of the 8th century and the Hoysala architecture popularised in the 13th century. [125] [126] The art of the Western Chalukyas is sometimes called the "" Gadag style"" after the number of ornate temples they built in the Tungabhadra River-Krishna River doab region of present-day Gadag district in Karnataka. [127] The dynasty's temple building activity reached its maturity and culmination in the 12th century with over a hundred temples built across the Deccan, more than half of them in present-day central Karnataka. [128] [129] Apart from temples, the dynasty's architecture is well known for the ornate stepped wells (Pushkarni) which served as ritual bathing places, a few of which are well preserved in Lakkundi. These stepped well designs were later incorporated by the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara empire in the coming centuries. [130] [131]
Ornate pillars at Saraswati temple in Gadag city, Karnataka
The Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi (Gadag district), [132] [133] the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal (Gadag district), [134] [135] the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti ( Bellary district ), [133] [136] the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali ( Davangere district ), [136] [137] the Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri ( Haveri district ), [138] [139] the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri ( Dharwad district ), [140] the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi ( Koppal district ), [141] [142] the Kaitabheshvara Temple at Kubatur, [143] and the Kedareshvara Temple at Balligavi are the finest examples produced by the later Chalukya architects. [144] The 12th-century Mahadeva Temple with its well executed sculptures is an exquisite example of decorative detail. The intricate, finely crafted carvings on walls, pillars and towers speak volumes about Chalukya taste and culture. An inscription outside the temple calls it ""Emperor of Temples"" (devalaya chakravarti) and relates that it was built by Mahadeva, a commander in the army of king Vikramaditya VI. [145] [146] The Kedareswara Temple (1060) at Balligavi is an example of a transitional Chalukya-Hoysala architectural style. [147] [148] The Western Chalukyas built temples in Badami and Aihole during their early phase of temple building activity, such as Mallikarjuna Temple, the Yellamma Temple and the Bhutanatha group of Temples . [149] [150]
Brahma Jinalaya at Lakkundi dates to the mid-late 11th century
The vimana of their temples (tower over the shrine) is a compromise in detail between the plain stepped style of the early Chalukyas and the decorative finish of the Hoysalas. [126] To the credit of the Western Chalukya architects is the development of the lathe turned (tuned) pillars and use of Soapstone (Chloritic Schist) as basic building and sculptural material, a very popular idiom in later Hoysala temples. They popularised the use of decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) in their sculptures. Famous architects in the Hoysala kingdom included Chalukyan architects who were natives of places such as Balligavi. [151] The artistic wall decor and the general sculptural idiom was dravidian architecture . [131] This style is sometimes called Karnata dravida, one of the notable traditions in Indian architecture. [152]

Old Kannada inscription from 1112 at Mahadeva Temple in Itagi, Karnataka ascribed to King Vikramaditya VI
The local language Kannada was mostly used in Western (Kalyani) Chalukya inscriptions and epigraphs. Some historians assert that ninety percent of their inscriptions are in the Kannada language while the remaining are in Sanskrit . [153] [11] More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to Vikramaditya VI than any other king prior to the 12th century, [154] many of which have been deciphered and translated by historians of the Archaeological Survey of India. [13] Inscriptions were generally either on stone (Shilashasana) or copper plates (Tamarashasana). This period saw the growth of Kannada as a language of literature and poetry, impetus to which came from the devotional movement of the Virashaivas (called Lingayatism ) who expressed their closeness to their deity in the form of simple lyrics called Vachanas. [155] At an administrative level, the regional language was used to record locations and rights related to land grants. When bilingual inscriptions were written, the section stating the title, genealogy, origin myths of the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses. This ensured the content was clearly understood by the local people without any ambiguity. [156]
In addition to inscriptions, chronicles called Vamshavalis were written to provide historical details of dynasties. Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama. In Kannada, writings on secular subjects became popular. Some well-known works are Chandombudhi, a prosody, and Karnataka Kadambari, a romance, both written by Nagavarma I , a lexicon called Rannakanda by Ranna (993), a book on medicine called Karnataka-Kalyanakaraka by Jagaddala Somanatha, the earliest writing on astrology called Jatakatilaka by Sridharacharya (1049), a writing on erotics called Madanakatilaka by Chandraraja, and an encyclopedia called Lokapakara by Chavundaraya II (1025).

Tiger reserves of India
(Redirected from Tiger Reserves of India )
Tiger conservation programme in India
The tiger reserves in India were set up as a part of Project Tiger initiated in 1973 and are administered by the National Tiger Conservation Authority of Government of India . As of December 2024, there are 57 protected areas that have been designated as tiger reserves. As of 2023, there were 3,682 wild tigers in India, which is almost 75% of the world's wild tiger population.
Goal
[ edit ]
As per the section 38 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 , the state governments are responsible preparing a Tiger Conservation Plan which includes planning and management of notified areas and maintaining the requisite competent staff to ensure the protection of the tiger reserve and providing inputs for maintaining a viable population of tigers, co-predators and prey animals. [1] [2]
Tiger population
[ edit ]
State wise tiger population (2018)
In 2006, it was estimated that there were 1,411 tigers living in the wild, the lowest ever recorded. [3] The 2010 National Tiger Assessment estimated the total population of wild tigers in India at 1,706. As per Ministry of Environment and Forests , the wild tiger population in India stood at 2,226 in 2014 with an increase of 30.5% since the 2010 estimate. [4]
In 2018, according to the National Tiger Conservation Authority, there were an estimated 2,967 wild tigers in existence in India. The wild tiger population increased to 3,682 as of 2022. [5] As India is home to majority of the global wild tiger population, the increase in population of tigers in India played a major role in driving up global populations as well; the number of wild tigers globally rose from 3,159 in 2010 to 3,890 in 2016 according to World Wildlife Fund and Global Tiger Forum. [6]
Tiger reserves
[ edit ]
Tiger reserves were set up as a part of Project Tiger initiated in 1973 and are administered by the National Tiger Conservation Authority of Government of India. Tiger reserves consist of a core area which includes part(s) of protected areas such as a national park or a wildlife sanctuary and a buffer zone which is a mix of forested and non-forested land. Project tiger is aimed at performing the necessary activities to ensure viability of tiger population in the core area and to promote a balance between the existence of people and animals in the buffer zones. [7]
In 1973, nine protected areas were initially designated as tiger reserves. By the late 1980s, the initial nine reserves covering an area of 9,115 km2 (3,519 sq mi) had been increased to 15 reserves covering an area of 24,700 km2 (9,500 sq mi). More than 1100 tigers were estimated to inhabit the reserves by 1984. [8] By 1997, 23 tiger reserves encompassed an area of 33,000 km2 (13,000 sq mi). [9] As of December 2024, there are 57 protected areas that have been designated as tiger reserves. [10]

Robert Sterling Yard in 1920
Robert Sterling Yard (1861–1945) was an American writer, journalist and wilderness activist. Yard graduated from Princeton University and spent the first twenty years of his career as a journalist, editor and publisher.  In 1915 he was recruited by his friend Stephen Mather to help publicize the need for an independent national park agency.  Their numerous publications were part of a movement that resulted in legislative support for a National Park Service in 1916. Yard served as head of the National Parks Educational Committee for several years after its conception, but tension within the NPS led him to concentrate on non-government initiatives. He became executive secretary of the National Parks Association in 1919. Yard worked to promote the national parks as well as educate Americans about their use. Creating high standards based on aesthetic ideals for park selection, he also opposed commercialism and industrialization of what he called ""America's masterpieces"". These standards caused discord with his peers. After helping to establish a relationship between the NPA and the United States Forest Service , Yard later became involved in the protection of wilderness areas. In 1935 he became one of the eight founding members of The Wilderness Society and acted as its first president from 1937 until his death eight years later. Yard is now considered an important figure in the modern wilderness movement. ( Full article... )

City governing body in India
Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation
1869(156 years ago) (1869), [1] Hyderabad, Telangana, India
Leadership
www.ghmc.gov.in
The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) is the civic body that oversees Hyderabad , the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana . It is the local government for the city of Hyderabad. It is one of the largest municipal corporations in India with a population of 7.9 million and an area of 650 km2.
History
[ edit ]
In 1869, municipal administration was first introduced for the city of Hyderabad. [6] The city of Hyderabad was divided into four and the suburbs of Chaderghat were divided into five divisions. The whole management of both the city and the suburbs was handled by the then City Police Commissioner, Kotwal-e-Baldia. [7]
In the same year, Sir Salar Jung I , the then Prime Minister of Hyderabad State under the Nizam , constituted the Department of Municipal and Road Maintenance. He also appointed a Municipal Commissioner for Hyderabad Board and Chaderghat Board. At that time, the city was just 55 km2 with a population of 3.5 lakhs.
In 1886, the suburban area of Chaderghat was handed over to a separate officer and then Chaderghat became Chaderghat Municipality.
In 1921 the size of Hyderabad Municipality increased to 84 km2.
Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (1933–2007)
[ edit ]
In 1933, Chaderghat Municipality was merged with Hyderabad Municipality to form Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and was given statutory status under the Hyderabad Municipal Act. During the following year (1934), the first elections were held for Municipal Corporation and a Standing Committee was appointed at that time. [7]
Jubilee Hills Municipality
In 1937, Jubilee Hills Municipality was formed by the amalgamation of Jubilee Hills and Banjara Hills. Later, in 1942, the corporation status for the city was removed.
Secunderabad Municipality
[ edit ]
In the year 1945, Secunderabad Municipality was formed. Again in 1950, Hyderabad regained its lost Corporation status along with the amalgamation of Jubilee Hills Municipality.
The Hyderabad Corporation and the Secunderabad Corporation, were established in 1950 via the Hyderabad Corporation Act. Jubilee Hills Municipality merged in Hyderabad Corporation during this time. [7] In 1955, the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act merged the municipal corporations overseeing Hyderabad and neighbouring Secunderabad.
Once again in 1955, both the municipal corporations of Hyderabad and Secunderabad were merged to form Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH). In 1956, Hyderabad became capital of Andhra Pradesh after the state was formed.
Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (2007–present)
The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation was formed on 16 April 2007 by merging 12 municipalities and 8 gram panchayats with the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad . The municipalities are L. B. Nagar , Gaddi Annaram , Uppal Kalan , Malkajgiri , Kapra , Alwal , Quthbullapur , Kukatpally , Serilingampally , Rajendranagar , Ramachandrapuram , and Patancheru . These municipalities are in Rangareddy district and Medak district . The panchayats are Shamshabad , Satamarai, Jallapalli, Mamdipalli, Mankhal, Almasguda, Sardanagar and Ravirala.
The Government Order 261 was initially issued in July 2005. Now, the Supreme Court has rejected the plea to interfere into the matter, the Andhra Pradesh government has passed the GO 261 that is related to the creation of Greater Hyderabad on 16 April 2007. Earlier, the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad had a population of 45 lakhs living in an area of 172 km2. The new urban agglomeration sprawls across 625 square kilometres (241 sq mi) with a population of 67 lakhs. [8] The erstwhile city of the Nizams has now transformed into an area far greater.
GHMC Head Office
The Government has decided to divide the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation into Six zones in 2019 (south, east, north, north east, west and central zones), 30 circles and 150 wards . [9] [10] [11] Old City has about 50 wards in seven circles. Each ward would cover about 40,000 - 50,000 people. [12] The GHMC is headed by a Commissioner and also has a Special Commissioner both of whom belong to IAS . Each zone will have a zonal commissioner, an officer of the rank of additional commissioner with a deputy municipal commissioners heading every circle. There will also be a separate engineering wing with an Engineer in Chief and Chief Engineer at head office level and a superintending engineer for each zone; a town planning wing with Additional Commissioner (Planning) and a Chief City Planner at the head office level and a city planner for each zone.
Secunderabad cantonment does not come under purview of GHMC. There are eight civilian wards in Secunderabad Cantonment Board, with a population of four lakh. [13]
In February 2018, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has listed its municipal bonds on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The civic body became the second to list its bonds on the BSE’s newly launched bond platform. [14]
Jurisdiction
The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) comprises the limits of the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) along with 10 municipalities and 8 panchayats in erstwhile Ranga Reddy district and 2 municipalities in erstwhile Medak district .
The 10 municipalities in the erstwhile Ranga Reddy district were:

Atithi Devo Bhava
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Hindu mantra
Learn how and when to remove this message
)
Atithi Devo Bhava, also spelt Atithidevo Bhava ( Sanskrit : अतिथिदेवो भव), English translation: A guest is akin to God, prescribes a dynamic of the host-guest relationship, which embodies the traditional Indian Hindu-Buddhist philosophy of revering guests with the same respect as a god. This concept of going out of the way to treat guests with reverence goes even beyond the traditional Hindu-Buddhist common greeting of namaste (I bow to the divinity in you) used for everyone.
The mantras are from the Taittiriya Upanishad , Shikshavalli I.11.2, which says: matrudevo bhava, mitradevo bhava, pitrudevo bhava, putradevo bhava, acharyadevo bhava, atithidevo bhava. It literally means ""be one for whom the Mother is God, be one for whom the Friend is God, be one for whom the Father is God, be one for whom the Child is God, be one for whom the Teacher is God, and be one for whom the Guest is God"". Matrudevah, mitradevah, pitrudevah, putradevah, acharyadevah, and atithidevah are one word each, and each one is a Bahuvrihi samasta-pada.
Ritual or Puja
In Sanatana Dharma personal God is worshipped in five-step worship; this is known as Panchopchara Puja. The ""Shodashopchar Poojan"" is more elaborate and formal, and involves 16 steps.
The five steps from the worship become the five formalities to be observed while receiving guests:
Fragrance ( Dhupa ) – While receiving guests, the rooms must have a pleasant fragrance because this is the first thing that attracts or detracts guests from their visit. A pleasant fragrance will put a guest in good humour.
Lamp ( Dipa ) – Prior to the electrification of India, a lamp was put between host and guest, so that expression and body language would remain clearly visible, and therefore no gap would be created between host and guest.
Eatables ( Naivedya ) – Fruits and sweets made of milk were offered to guests.
Rice ( Akshata ) – It is a symbol of being undivided. A tilak , often made of a vermilion paste, is put on the forehead, [1] and rice grains are placed on it. This is the highest form of welcome in Hindu Indian families.
Flower offering ( Pushpa ) – A flower is a gesture of goodwill. When the guest departs, the flower symbolizes the sweet memories of the visit, which stay with them for several days.
Campaign by the Government of India
[ edit ]
India attracts millions of tourists each year. To further enhance the number of tourists traveling to India, the Tourism Department of India started the Atithi Devo Bhava campaign with the theme Incredible India . [2]
""Atithi Devo Bhava"" is a social awareness campaign that aims at providing the inbound tourist a greater sense of being welcomed to the country. The campaign targets the general public, while focusing mainly on the stakeholders of the tourism industry. The campaign provides training and orientation to taxi driver, guides, immigration officers, police, and other personnel who interact directly with the tourist. [2]

Chartres Cathedral , also known as the Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres, is a Catholic cathedral in Chartres , France, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) southwest of Paris . It is the seat of the bishop of Chartres . Mostly constructed between 1194 and 1220, it stands on the site of at least five cathedrals that have occupied the site since the Diocese of Chartres was formed as an episcopal see in the 4th century. It is one of the best-known and most influential examples of High Gothic and Classic Gothic architecture. Chartres Cathedral is known for its stained glass , and contains 167 stained-glass windows dating from the 12th century to the 20th century. This photograph shows the stained glass in the north transept of Chartres Cathedral. The rose window , which is 10.5 metres (34 feet) in diameter, was installed circa 1230 and contains imagery relating to the Virgin Mary and figures from the Old Testament . The presence of the coats of arms of King Louis IX and his mother Blanche of Castile are taken as a sign of royal patronage for this window. Below the rose are five lancet windows , each 7.5 metres (25 feet) tall, depicting Saint Anne and four Old Testament figures.

Qutb Shahi tombs - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,"Toggle the table of contents
Qutb Shahi tombs
Tombs of Subhan Quli (front) and Sultan Quli (rear)
Type
Telangana State Archaeology and Museums Department, Aga Khan Trust for Culture [1] [2]
Architectural style(s)
Indo-Islamic
The Qutub Shahi Tombs are located in the Ibrahim Bagh (garden precinct), close to the famous Golconda Fort in Hyderabad, India . They contain the tombs and mosques built by the various kings of the Qutub Shahi dynasty . [3] [4] The galleries of the smaller tombs are of a single storey while the larger ones are two-storied. In the centre of each tomb is a sarcophagus which overlies the actual burial vault in a crypt below. The domes were originally overlaid with blue and green tiles, of which only a few pieces now remain. [5]
The complex was put by UNESCO on its ""tentative list"" to become a World Heritage Site in 2014, with others in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there being a number of different sultanates).
Location
[ edit ]
View of Qutb Shahi Tombs from the Golkonda fort
The tomb complex lies north of the outer perimeter wall of Golkonda Fort and its Banjara Darwaza (Gate of the Gypsies), amidst the Ibrahim bagh.
Description
[ edit ]
The tombs form a large cluster and stand on a raised platform. They are domed structures built on a square base surrounded by pointed arches, a distinctive style that blends Persian and Indian forms . The tombs are structures with intricately carved stonework and are surrounded by landscaped gardens. [6]
The tombs were once furnished with carpets , chandeliers , and velvet canopies on silver poles. Copies of the Quran were kept on pedestals and readers recited verses from the holy book at regular intervals. Golden spires were fitted over the tombs of the sultans to distinguish their tombs from those of other members of the royal families.
History
[ edit ]
During the Qutb Shahi period, these tombs were held in great veneration. In 1687, during the Siege of Golconda , the tombs were converted into barracks by the invading Mughal army, and the grounds were turned into a camp. Guns were mounted onto the mausoleums in order to bomb the fortress. [7]
The tombs fell into disrepair until Sir Salar Jung III ordered their restoration in the early 19th century. A garden was laid out, and a compound wall was built. Once again, the tomb garden of the Qutb Shahi family became a place of serene beauty. All except the last of the Qutb Shahi sultans lie buried here.

Description of each tomb
[ edit ]
Sultan Quli Qutb Mulk 's tomb, the style of which sets the example for the tombs of his descendants, is on an elevated terrace measuring 30 meters in each direction. The tomb chamber proper is octagonal, with each side measuring around 10 meters. The entire structure is crowned by a circular dome. There are three graves in this tomb chamber and twenty-one laid out on the surrounding terrace, all of which lack inscription except for the main tomb. The inscription on Sultan Quli's tomb is in three bands, in the Naskh and Tauq scripts. The inscription refers to Sultan Quli as Bade Malik (Great Master) — the endearing term by which all people of the Deccan used for him. The tomb was built in 1543 A.D. by the Sultan, during his lifetime, as was the custom. [8]
Near the tomb of Sultan Quli is that of his son, Jamsheed , the second in the line of Qutb Shahi sultans. Built in 1550 A.D., [9] this is the only Qutb Shahi tomb which has not been fashioned from shining black basalt. Its appearance, too, is quite unlike the other tombs in the garden — it rises gracefully in two stories, unlike the squat tombs of the other kings. Jamsheed Quli Qutb Shah 's is the only tomb of a Qutb Shahi ruler without any inscriptions; of course, Jamsheed's son, Subhan's tomb also does not have any inscriptions. Subhan Quli Qutb Shah ruled for a short time. Subhan's tomb stands midway between the tombs of his father and grandfather. He was popularly called Chhote Malik (Small Master).
Sultan Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah 's tomb, built in 1580, after his death, is slightly larger than Sultan Quli's tomb. [10] Traces of the enameled tiles, which once adorned this mausoleum, can still be seen on the southern wall. The tomb has two graves in the main chamber and 16 on the terrace; some of them probably are those of his six sons and three daughters. There are inscriptions in the Thuluth script on all faces of the sarcophagus. The three famous calligraphists — Isphalan, Ismail, and Taqiuddin Muhammad Salih — who left a store of Naskh, Thuluth, and Nastaliq inscriptions on the many Qutb Shahi edifices in the city, were contemporaries of Ibrahim Shah.
Tomb of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah
Sultan Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah 's mausoleum is considered the grandest of the Qutb Shahi tombs. Built in 1602 A.D., the tomb is on a terrace of 65m square and 4m high. A flight of steps leads to the mausoleum proper, which is 22 m square on the outside and 11 m square on the inside. There are entrances on the southern and eastern sides. The tomb is in a vault below the terrace. Inscriptions in Persian and the Naskh scripts decorate it.
Another grand mausoleum is that of the sixth sultan, Muhammed Qutb Shah . The facade of this tomb was once decorated with enameled tiles; only traces are now evident. There are six graves and inscriptions in Thuluth and Naskh. The mausoleum was built in 1626. Sultan Abdullah Qutb Shah 's tomb is the last of the royal tombs, as Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (Tana Shah), the last Qutb Shahi Sultan, was a prisoner in the fortress of Daulatabad, near Aurangabad, when he died. While the tombs of those who ruled dominate the area, interspersed are many other monuments, most of them tombs of other members of the royal family.
The tomb of Fatima Sultan, with its bulbous dome, is near the entrance to the tomb-garden. Fatima was the sister of Muhammed Qutb Shah. Her tomb houses several graves, two with inscriptions. Immediately to the south of Muhammed Quli's tomb are three uninscribed tombs. There are the mausoleums of Kulthoom, Muhammed Qutb Shahi's granddaughter born of the son of the sultan's favourite wife Khurshid Bibi, her (Kulthoom's) husband and daughter. Kulthoom's tomb is on the west of this cluster.
The twin-tombs of the two favourite hakims (physicians) of Sultan Abdullah — Nizamuddin Ahmed Gilani and Abdul Jabbar Gilani — were built in 1651. They are among the few Qutb Shahi tombs that are not of royalty. Another pair are those of Premamati and Taramati, the favourite courtesans of Sultan Abdullah Shah, who were laid to rest beside his tomb. One other tomb which is not that of a Qutb Shahi family member is that of Neknam Khan. Neknam Khan, who served in Abdullah's army, was the commander-in-chief of the Carnatic. His tomb is on a platform outside the mausoleum of Ibrahim Qutb Shah. It was built in 1672, two years after Nekam Khan's death.
Archways at Qutb Shahi Tombs
The last sultan of the dynasty, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (also known as Tana Shah), was not buried alongside his ancestor. Instead, he was buried at Khuldabad . The mausoleum which Abul Hasan , the last Qutb Shahi Sultan, began building for himself, actually houses the grave of Mir Ahmed, the son of Sultan Abdullah's son-in-law and the sister of Abbas II Safair, the Shah of Persia. The tomb of Fadma Khanum, one of Sultan Abdullah's daughters, stands near the mausoleum of her husband, Mir Ahmed. Hers is the only Qutb Shahi tomb not surmounted by a dome.
To the west of the tombs lies the dargah of Hussain Shah Wali , the revered Sufi saint. He is most affectionately remembered by people as the builder of Hussain Sagar in 1562. Among other monuments in the garden that are not tombs, the most important are the mortuary bath and the Masjid of Hayat Bakshi Begum.
The Great Mosque in the Qutb Shahi Tombs Complex
The mortuary bath, which stands opposite the tomb of Muhammad Quli, was built by Sultan Quli to facilitate the ritual washing of the bodies of the dead kings and others of the royal family before they were carried to their final resting place. The practice followed was to bring the body out of the fort, through the Banjara Gate, to this bath, before carrying it away for burial with the ritualistic pomp that was required to mark the occasion. A large number of people — relatives, officials, friends, and fond subjects — attended. The bath is one of the finest existing specimens of ancient Persian or Turkish baths.
The Qutb Shahis built a number of masjids all over Golkonda and Hyderabad, and almost every tomb has a masjid adjacent. The biggest and the grandest such masjid is by the mausoleum of Hayat Bakshi Begum. Popularly known as the great masjid of the Golkonda tombs, it was built in 1666 A.D. Fifteen cupolas decorate the roof and the prayer-hall is flanked by two lofty minarets. The impression, as a whole, is one of majesty and splendour. The inscriptions in the masjid are in calligraphic art.
Hayat Bakshi Begum was the daughter of Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth sultan, the wife of Sultan Muhammed Qutb Shah, the sixth sultan, and the mother of Abdullah Qutb Shah, the seventh sultan. She was affectionately known as ""Ma Saheba"" (Revered Mother). The tomb-garden of the sultans of Golkonda was known as ""Lagar-e-Faiz Athar"" (a place for bountiful entertainment) in the days of the Qutb Shahi rulers, for some item or song or dance or even an occasional play was staged here every evening, free of cost, to entertain the poor.
In Art and Literature
An engraving of a painting by William Purser entitled The Tombs of the Kings of Golconda . is the subject of a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1838. [11]
21st century restoration
[ edit ]
The Telangana State Archaeology and Museums Department, in collaboration with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture , has restored the tombs. The restoration of the step-wells within the complex was funded by the US Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation . [12] The restoration work started in 2013, [13] [3] and was unveiled by the U.S. Ambassador to India on 10 March 2020. [14] While restoration work paused due to the Covid-19 pandemic, work has now continued at a slower rate. [15]

Later, Maharana Udai Singh, impressed by the charm of this lake with the backdrop of green hills, founded the city of Udaipur on the banks of the lake and also enlarged the Lake by constructing a stone masonry dam in the Badipol region on the shore of the lake.
There are four islands on the lake:
Jag Niwas, where is built the Lake Palace
Jag Mandir , with the palace of the same name
Mohan Mandir, from where the king would watch the annual Gangaur festival celebration
Arsi Vilas, a small island which was an ammunition depot, and also a small palace
Monsoon Palace

Agra - Wikipedia,https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tourist_attractions_in_Agra,"[ edit ]
Agra has two histories: one of the ancient city on the east, or left, bank of the river Yamuna , going back so far as to be lost in the legends of Krishna and Mahabharata and reestablished by Sikandar Lodhi in 1504–1505; the other of the modern city, founded by Akbar in 1558, on the right bank of the river which is associated with the Mughals , and known throughout the world as the city of the Taj. Of ancient Agra little now remains except  few traces of the foundations. It was a place of importance under various Hindu dynasties previous to the Muslim invasions of India , but its history is unclear, and possess little historical interest. [16] The 17th century chronicler named Abdullah said it was a village before the reign of Sikandar Lodi. The king of Mathura had used the Agra fort as a jail. The degradation in the status of the site was a result of the destruction brought upon it by Mahmud of Ghazni . [17] Masud Sa'd Salman claims to have been there when Mahmud assaulted Agra, claiming the Raja Japal surrendered after seeing a nightmare. Mahmud however proceeds to pillage the city. [18]
The Tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani in Sikandra was originally built as a Baradari by Sultan Sikandar Lodi in 1495.
Agra's period of historical importance began during Sikandar Lodi's reign. In 1504–1505, Sultan Sikandar Lodi (reigned 1489–1517 [19] ), the Afghan ruler of the Delhi Sultanate , rebuilt Agra and made it the seat of government. [16] [20] Sikandar Lodhi appointed a commission which inspected and surveyed both sides of the Yamuna from Delhi to Etawah and finally chose a place on the left bank, or the east side of the Yamuna, as the site for the city. Agra on the left bank of the Yamuna grew into a large flourishing town with royal presence, officials, merchants, scholars, theologians and artists. The city became one of the most important centres of Islamic learning in India. The sultan founded the village of Sikandra in the northern suburbs of the city and built there a Baradari of red sandstone in 1495, which was converted into a tomb by Jahangir, and now stands as the Tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani , Akbar's empress. [21] [22]
After the Sultan's death in 1517, the city passed on to his son, Sultan Ibrahim Lodi (reigned 1517–26 [19] ). He ruled his sultanate from Agra until he was defeated and killed by Mughal Emperor Babur in the First battle of Panipat , fought in 1526. [23]
Mughal era
[ edit ]
The Town and Fort of Agra, an engraving
The golden age of the city began with the Mughals . Agra was the foremost city of the subcontinent and the capital of the Mughal Empire until 1658, when Aurangzeb shifted the entire court to Delhi. [24]
Babur (reigned 1526–30 [25] ), the founder of the Mughal dynasty, acquired Agra after defeating the Lodhis and the Tomaras of Gwalior in the First Battle of Panipat in 1526. [25] [26] Babur's connection with Agra began immediately after the battle of Panipat. He sent forward his son Humayun , who occupied the town without opposition. The Raja of Gwalior, slain at Panipat, had left his family and the heads of his clan at Agra. In gratitude to Humayun, who treated them magnanimously, and protected them from plunder, they presented to him a quantity of jewels and precious stones as a token of homage. Among these was the famous diamond Koh-i-nur . [26] Babur went on to lay out the first formal Mughal garden in India, the Aram Bagh (or Garden of Relaxation) on the banks of the river Yamuna. Babur was determined to establish the seat of his government at Agra, but was almost dissuaded by the desolate appearance of the region, as clear from this quote from his memoir Baburnama : [26]
It always appears to me, that one of the chief defects of Hindustan is the want of artificial watercourses. I had intended, wherever I might fix my residence, to construct water-wheels, to produce an artificial stream, and to lay out an elegant and regularly planned pleasure ground. Shortly after coming to Agra I passed the Jumna with this object in view, and examined the country to pitch upon a fit spot for a garden. The whole was so ugly and detestable that I repassed the river quite repulsed and disgusted. In consequence of the want of beauty and of the disagreeable aspect of the country, I gave up my intention of making a charbagh (garden house); but as no better situation presented itself near Agra, I was finally compelled to make the best of this same spot.... In every corner I planted suitable gardens, in every garden I sowed roses and narcissus regularly, and in beds corresponding to each other. We were annoyed by three things in Hindustan; one was its heat, another the strong winds, and the third its dust. Baths were the means of removing all three inconveniences.
Babur, Baburnama
Very few vestiges remain of Babur's city, of his fruit and flower gardens, palaces, baths, tanks, wells and watercourses. The remnants of Babur's Charbagh can be seen today at Aram Bagh , on the east side of Yamuna. [26] [27] Babur was followed by his son Humayun (reigned 1530–40 and 1555–56 [25] ), but he was completely defeated at Kanauj in 1539, just nine years after his ascension, by Sher Shah Suri , an Afghan nobleman, who had submitted to Babur, but revolted against his son. In this brief interruption in Mughal rule between 1540 and 1556, Sher Shah Suri , established the short lived Sur Empire , and the region was eventually reconquered by Akbar in the Second Battle of Panipat in 1556.
Under Akbar (reigned 1556–1605 [25] ), and followed by his grandson Shah Jahan , Agra was immortalised in the history of the world. Akbar built the modern city of Agra on the right bank of Yamuna, where the majority of its part still lies. He converted the city into a great centre of political, cultural and economic importance, connecting it with the various parts of his vast empire. Akbar raised the towering ramparts of the Agra Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new capital city of Fatehpur Sikri , around 35 km from Agra. The new capital city was later abandoned. [28] [29] Before his death, Agra had become probably one of the biggest cities in the east, with huge amounts of trade and commerce happening through its bazaars. [30] The English traveller Ralph Fitch who visited Agra in September 1585 in the life-time of Akbar, writes about the town: [29]
Agra is a very great city, and populous, built with stone, having fair and large streets with a fair river running by it . . . . Agra and Fatehpur Sikri are two very great cities, either of them much greater than London, and very populous. Between Agra and Fatehpur are twelve miles ( kos in reality) and all the way is a market of victuals and other things as full as though a man were still in a town, and so many people as if a man were in a market.
These impressions of Fitch are corroborated by another European traveller, William Finch , who remarked about Agra: [29]
It is spacious, large, populous beyond measure, that you can hardly pass the street . . . .
Agra continued to expand and flourish during Akbar's successor Jahangir's reign as he wrote in his autobiography Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri: [29] [30]
The habitable part of Agra extends on both sides of the river. On its west side, which has the greater population, its circumference is seven kos, and its breadth is one kos. The circumference of the inhabited part on the other side of the river, the side towards the east, is 2
1⁄2 kos, its length being one kos and its breadth half a kos. But in the number of its buildings it is equal to several cities of Iraq, Khurasan and Trans-Oxiana put together. Many persons have erected buildings of three or four storeys in it. The mass of the people is so great that moving about in the lanes and bazars is difficult.
Akbar's successor Jahangir (reigned 1605–27 [25] ) had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort. [31] Akbar's mausoleum at Sikandra was completed during Jahangir's reign. The Jahangiri Mahal in Agra fort and the tomb of Itmad-ud-daulah were also constructed during the reign of Jahangir. Jahangir loved Lahore and Kashmir more than Agra, but the latter continued to be the first city of the realm. [24] It was, however, Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–58 [25] ) whose building activity raised Agra to the pinnacle of its glory. Shah Jahan, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Agra its most prized monument, the Taj Mahal . Built in loving memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal , the mausoleum was completed in 1653. The Jama Masjid and several other notable buildings like the Diwan-i-Am , the Diwan-i-Khas , the Moti Masjid , etc., inside the fort were planned and executed under his orders. [24]
Shah Jahan later shifted the capital to Shahjahanabad (now known as Delhi ) in the year 1648, [32] followed by his son Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707 [25] ) moving the entire court to Delhi in 1658. With this Agra began rapidly declining. Nevertheless, the cultural and strategic importance of Agra remained unaffected and in official correspondence it continued to be referred to as the second capital of the empire. [24]
Later periods
Map of the city, c. 1914
Agra, Main Street, c. 1858
The decline of the Mughal empire caused the emergence of several regional kingdoms, and in the late 18th century the control of the city fell successively to the Jats, the Marathas, the Mughals, the ruler of Gwalior, and finally the British East India Company. [33] The Jats of Bharatpur , waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra. [34] After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of another post-Mughal Empire power, the Marathas , before falling into the hands of the British East India Company in 1803. [33] In the years 1834–1836, Agra was the capital of the short-lived Presidency of Agra , administered by a Governor . It was then the capital of the North-Western Province from 1836 to 1858, governed by a Lieutenant-Governor. [35] [36] Agra was one of the centres of the Indian rebellion of 1857 . [37]
During the Indian rebellion of 1857, when East India Company rule across many parts of India was threatened, the news of the mutiny at Meerut reached Agra on 14 May. On 30 May some companies of the 44th and 67th Native Infantry sent to Mathura to bring in the treasury mutinied and carried off the treasury to the rebels in Delhi. With the fear of the rebellion spreading to Agra as well, the rest of these native infantry battalions, which were part of the garrison at Agra, were successfully disarmed by the British on 31 May. [13] [38] However, when the Gwalior contingent mutinied on 15 June, all other native units followed. On 2 July the rebel force of the Nimach and Nasirabad contingents reached Fatehpur Sikri . Fearing advance of the mutineers to Agra, some 6000 Europeans and associated people moved into the Agra Fort for safety on 3 July. On 5 July, the British force stationed there attempted to attack an approaching force of Mutineers, but was defeated, and the British retreated back into the fort. [13] The Lieutenant-Governor, J.R. Colvin , died there, and was later buried in front of the Diwan-i-am . [39] [13] The mutineers, however, moved over to Delhi , it being a more important attraction for the rebels. Despite an uprising by a mob and extreme disorder in the city, the British managed to restore partial order by 8 July. [13] Delhi, in turn, fell to the British in September, following which an infantry brigade led by Brigadier Edward Greathed arrived in Agra on 11 October without any opposition from rebels. But shortly after their arrival another force of mutineers attacked the brigade by surprise, but was defeated and routed. This minor victory for the British was named the Battle of Agra . [40] [13] It is to be said that, the uprising in Agra was relatively minor compared to Delhi , Jhansi , Meerut and other major rebellious cities and regions. [39] After this British rule was again secured, and the British Raj ruled the city till the independence of India in 1947. [41] The capital of the North Western Provinces was shifted from Agra to Allahabad in 1858. Gradually, Agra declined to the position of a mere provincial town, and its prosperity declined: [36]
But in the economy of the administration of British India Agra is nothing more than a district town; its size, proportions and manifold activities have come down to its present requirements, and continued life in this city does not come above the average of that monotonous muffasil life in India which has been so often and so vividly described by many gifted Anglo-Indian writers. Agra has become of late years a large railway centre, and its commercial prosperity seems to be reviving.
Agra by 1892, as described by S.C. Mukerji, Traveller's Guide to Agra, pp 55-56
Agra's role in the Indian Independence movement is not well documented. [42] However, in the years between the mutiny and independence Agra was a major centre of Hindi and Urdu journalism.[ citation needed ] Paliwal park (formerly Hewitt park) in Agra is named after S.K.D Paliwal , [43] who brought out the Hindi daily Sainik. [44]
Post Independence and Mughal legacy
[ edit ]
Post India's independence, Agra has been a part of Uttar Pradesh and has gradually developed into an industrial city, with a significant contribution to Uttar Pradesh's economy. The city is now a popular tourist destination and hosts tourists from across the world. [45] The Taj Mahal and Agra Fort received UNESCO World Heritage Sites status in 1983. [46] [47] The Taj Mahal witnesses tourists, photographers, historians and archaeologists in massive numbers all around the year. The Taj Mahal has become a symbol of India. [48] [ better source needed ] [49] Post Independence, Taj Mahal has been visited by world leaders like US Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower (1959), Bill Clinton (2000), and Donald Trump (2020). Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom had visited Taj Mahal in 1961 on her India visit. Taj Mahal has also been visited by Russian President Vladimir Putin (1999), Chinese President Hu Jintao (2006), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (2018) and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (2018). [50] Agra is the birthplace of the now extinct religion known as Din-i-Ilahi , which was founded by Akbar [51] and also of the Radhaswami Faith ,[ citation needed ] which has around two million followers worldwide. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur ; [52] and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with Lucknow and Varanasi .

Public donations were the main source of books for the library, and by donations of Rupees 300 from proprietors. Dwarakanath Tagore was the first proprietor of the library. The library was initially only partially public, as poor students could use the library for a limited period of time. The Imperial Library was founded in 1891 by merging several libraries like those of the East India College and East India Board. Governor General Lord Curzon initiated the merger of these two libraries into a single Imperial Library in 1903 at the Metcalfe Hall . The goal of the library was to collect every book written about India at any time. The Assistant Librarian of the British Museum John Macfarlane was the first librarian and was succeeded by the first Indian librarian Harinath De . The library was moved to its present quarters in Belvedere Estate , Alipore and renamed the National Library .

The Times of India, also known by its abbreviation TOI, is an Indian English -language daily newspaper and digital news media owned and managed by The Times Group . It is the fourth-largest newspaper in India by circulation and largest selling English-language daily in the world . [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] It is the oldest English-language newspaper in India, and the second-oldest Indian newspaper still in circulation, with its first edition published in 1838. [9] It is nicknamed as ""The Old Lady of Bori Bunder "", [10] [11] and is a "" newspaper of record "". [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]
Near the beginning of the 20th century, Lord Curzon , the Viceroy of India , called TOI ""the leading paper in Asia"". [19] [20] In 1991, the BBC ranked TOI among the world's six best newspapers. [21] [22]
It is owned and published by Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd. (B.C.C.L.), which is owned by the Sahu Jain family. In the Brand Trust Report India study 2019, TOI was rated as the most trusted English newspaper in India. [23] In a 2021 survey, Reuters Institute rated TOI as the most trusted media news brand among English-speaking, online news users in India. [24] [25] In recent decades, the newspaper has been criticised for establishing in the Indian news industry the practice of accepting payments from persons and entities in exchange for positive coverage . [4]
History
Times of India Buildings, c. 1898
1800s
Diamond Jubilee , November 1898
TOI issued its first edition on 3 November 1838 as The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce. [26] [27] The paper was published on Wednesdays and Saturdays under the direction of Raobahadur Narayan Dinanath Velkar , a Maharashtrian social reformer , and contained news from Britain and the world, as well as the Indian Subcontinent . J. E. Brennan was its first editor he died in 1839  and George Buist became the Editor. It became a daily in 1850 under him. George Buist had a pro British editorial policy and  a Parsi shareholder Fardoonji Naoroji wanted him to change his editorial policy particularly in background of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . However, Buist refused to change his editorial policy or give up his editorial independence. After a shareholder's meeting he was replaced by Robert Knight . [28] [29] [30] [31]
In 1860, editor Robert Knight (1825–1892) bought the Indian shareholders' interests, merged with rival Bombay Standard, and started India's first news agency. It wired Times dispatches to papers across the country and became the Indian agent for Reuters news service. In 1861, he changed the name from the Bombay Times and Standard to The Times of India. Knight fought for a press free of prior restraint or intimidation, frequently resisting the attempts by governments, business interests and cultural spokesmen, and led the paper to national prominence. [32] [33] In the 19th century, this newspaper company employed more than 800 people and had a sizeable circulation in India and Europe.
Bennett and Coleman ownership

)
Subsequently, TOI saw its ownership change several times until 1892 when an English journalist named Thomas Jewell Bennett , along with Frank Morris Coleman (who later drowned in the 1915 sinking of the SS Persia ), acquired the newspaper through their new joint stock company, Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd.
1900s
[ edit ]
Sir Stanley Reed edited TOI from 1907 until 1924 [34] and received correspondence from major figures of India such as Mahatma Gandhi . In all he lived in India for fifty years. He was respected in the United Kingdom as an expert on Indian current affairs.[ citation needed ]
Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd was sold to sugar magnate Ramkrishna Dalmia of the industrial family, for ₹20 million (equivalent to ₹2.9 billion or US$33 million in 2023) in 1946, as India became independent and the British owners left. [35] In 1955 the Vivian Bose Commission of Inquiry found that Ramkrishna Dalmia, in 1947, had engineered the acquisition of the media giant Bennett Coleman & Co. by transferring money from a bank and an insurance company of which he was the chairman. In the court case that followed, Ramkrishna Dalmia was sentenced to two years in Tihar Jail after having been convicted of embezzlement and fraud. [4]
Most of the jail term he managed to spend in hospital. Upon his release, his son-in-law, Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain , to whom he had entrusted the running of Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd., rebuffed his efforts to resume command of the company. [4]
Jain family (Shanti Prasad Jain)
[ edit ]
In the early 1960s, Shanti Prasad Jain was imprisoned on charges of selling newsprint on the black market. [36] And based on the Vivian Bose Commission's earlier report which found wrongdoings of the Dalmia – Jain group, that included specific charges against Shanti Prasad Jain, the Government of India filed a petition to restrain and remove the management of Bennett, Coleman and Company. Based on the pleading, the Justice directed the Government to assume control of the newspaper which resulted in replacing half of the directors and appointing a Bombay High Court judge as the chairman. [37]
Under the Government of India
TOI on a 1988 stamp
TOI on a 2013 stamp
Following the Vivian Bose Commission report indicating serious wrongdoings of the Dalmia–Jain group, on 28 August 1969, the Bombay High Court, under Justice J. L. Nain, passed an interim order to disband the existing board of Bennett, Coleman & Co and to constitute a new board under the Government. The bench ruled that ""Under these circumstances, the best thing would be to pass such orders on the assumption that the allegations made by the petitioners that the affairs of the company were being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest and to the interests of the Company are correct"". [19] Following that order, Shanti Prasad Jain ceased to be a director and the company ran with new directors on board, appointed by the Government of India, with the exception of a lone stenographer of the Jains. The court appointed D K Kunte as chairman of the board. Kunte had no prior business experience and was also an opposition member of the Lok Sabha .[ citation needed ]
Back to the Jain family
[ edit ]
In 1976, during the Emergency in India, the Government transferred ownership of the newspaper back to Ashok Kumar Jain , who was Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain's son and Ramkrishna Dalmia's grandson. He is the father of the current owners Samir Jain and Vineet Jain ). [38] The Jains too often landed themselves in various money laundering scams and Ashok Kumar Jain had to flee the country when the Enforcement Directorate pursued his case strongly in 1998 for alleged violations of illegal transfer of funds (to the tune of US$1.25 million) to an overseas account in Switzerland . [39] [40] [41] [42]
During the Emergency
[ edit ]
On 26 June 1975, the day after India declared a state of emergency , the Bombay edition of TOI carried an entry in its obituary column that read ""D.E.M. O'Cracy, beloved husband of T.Ruth, father of L.I.Bertie, brother of Faith, Hope and Justice expired on 25 June"". [43] The move was a critique of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi 's 21-month state of emergency, which is now widely known as ""the Emergency"" and seen by many as a roundly authoritarian era of Indian government. [44] [45]
Bombay Times
[ edit ]
The Bombay Times is a free supplement of The Times of India, in the Mumbai (formerly Bombay ) region.

Criticism and controversies
This article appears to be slanted towards recent events . Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. (December 2019)
Paid news
Main article: Paid news in India
TOI has been criticised for being the first to institutionalise the practice of paid news in India, where politicians, businessmen, corporations and celebrities can pay the newspaper and its journalists would carry the desired news for the payer. [4] [55] [56] The newspaper offers prominence with which the paid news is placed and the page on which it is displayed based on the amount of the payment. According to this practice, a payment plan assures a news feature and ensures positive coverage to the payer. [4]
In 2005, TOI began the practice of ""private treaties"", also called as ""brand capital"", where new companies, individuals or movies seeking mass coverage and public relations, major brands and organisations were offered sustained positive coverage and plugs in its news columns in exchange for shares or other forms of financial obligations to Bennett, Coleman & Company, Ltd. (B.C.C.L.) – the owners of TOI. [4] [55]
The B.C.C.L., with its ""private treaties"" program, acquired stakes in 350 companies and generated 15% of its revenues by 2012, according to a critical article in The New Yorker . The ""paid news"" and ""private treaties"" practice started by TOI has since been adopted by The Hindustan Times group, the India Today group, the Outlook group, and other major media groups in India including Indian television channels. [4] [57] This division of the company was later renamed Brand Capital and has contracts in place with many companies in diverse sectors.[ citation needed ]
The ""paid news"" and ""private treaties"" blur the lines between content and advertising, with the favourable coverage written by the staff reporters on the payroll of TOI. [4] The newspaper has defended its practice in 2012 by stating that it includes a note of disclosure to the reader – though in a small font – that its contents are ""advertorial, entertainment promotional feature"", that they are doing this to generate revenues just like ""all newspapers in the world do advertorials"" according to TOI owners. [4] [55] According to Maya Ranganathan, this overlap in the function of a journalist to also act as a marketing and advertisement revenue seeker for the newspaper raises conflict of interest questions, a problem that has morphed into ever-larger scale in India and recognised by India's SEBI authority in July 2009. [55]
Under an ad sales initiative called Medianet, if a large company or Bollywood studio sponsored a news-worthy event, the event would be covered by TOI, but the name of the company or studio that sponsored it would not be mentioned in the paper unless they paid TOI for advertising. In 2010, a report by a subcommittee of the Press Council of India found that Medianet's paid news strategy had spread to a large number of newspapers and more than five hundred television channels. [4] [58]
Critics state that the company's paid news and private treaties skew its coverage and shield its newspaper advertisers from scrutiny. [4]
The Hoot, a media criticism website, has pointed out that when a lift in a 19-storey luxury apartment complex in Bangalore crashed -- killing two workers and injuring seven -- all the English language and Kannada language newspapers, with the exception of TOI, called out the name of the construction company, Sobha Developers, which was a private-treaty partner. An article titled ""reaping gold through bt cotton"" -- which first appeared in the Nagpur edition of TOI in 2008 -- reappeared unchanged in 2011, this time with a small-print alert that the article was a ""marketing feature"". In both cases, the article was factually incorrect and made false claims about the success of Monsanto 's genetically modified cotton. [4]
According to a critical article published in the Indian investigative news magazine The Caravan , when the Honda Motors plant in Gurgaon experienced an eight-month-long conflict between management and non-unionised workers over wages and work conditions in 2005, the Times of India covered the concerns of Honda and the harm done to India's investment climate, and largely ignored the issues raised by workers. [4]
Vineet Jain , managing director of B.C.C.L., has insisted that a wall does exist between sales and the newsroom, and that the paper does not give favorable coverage to the company's business partners. ""Our editors don't know who we have,"" Jain said, although he later acknowledged that all private-treaty clients are listed on the company's Web site. [4] Ravindra Dhariwal, the former CEO of B.C.C.L. had defended private treaties in a 2010 interview with the magazine Outlook and claims that the partners in the private treaties sign contracts where they agree to clauses that they will not receive any favourable editorial coverage.[ citation needed ]
Anti-competitive behaviour
[ edit ]
There have been claims that TOI would strike deals with advertisers only if they removed their advertisements from other competitor newspapers. [4]
TOI is also embroiled in an active lawsuit against the Financial Times . In 1993, when the Financial Times was preparing to enter the Indian market, Samir Jain , the vice-chairman of B.C.C.L., registered the term ""Financial Times"" as a trademark of his company and declared it his intellectual property in an attempt to stymie the Financial Times and prevent them from competing with The Economic Times , which is owned by B.C.C.L. [4]
In 1994, when the Hindustan Times was the top-selling paper in New Delhi, TOI slashed their prices by a third, to one and a half rupees after having built up their ads sales force in preparation for the price drop to make up for the lost circulation revenue. By 1998, the Hindustan Times had dropped to second place in Delhi. TOI took a similar strategy in Bangalore where they dropped the price to one rupee despite protests from Siddharth Varadarajan , one of the editors of the newspaper at the time, who called the strategy ""predatory pricing"". [4]
Cobrapost sting operation
[ edit ]
In 2018, Vineet Jain , managing director of B.C.C.L., and Sanjeev Shah, executive president of B.C.C.L., were caught on camera as part of a sting operation by Cobrapost agreeing to promote right-wing content through the group's many media properties for a proposed spend of ₹500 crore (US$58 million), some of which the client said could only be paid with black money. [59] B.C.C.L. has responded to the sting claiming that the video that was released by Cobrapost was ""doctored"" and ""incomplete"" and that the CEO Vineet Jain was engaged in a ""reverse-sting"" of his own to expose the undercover reporter during the filming of the video. [60] The company is yet to release the video evidence.[ citation needed ]

The Chalukya dynasty ( [tʃaːɭukjə] ) was a Classical Indian dynasty that ruled large parts of southern and central India between the 6th and the 12th centuries. During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the ""Badami Chalukyas"", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami ) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II . After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan . They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas , in the late 10th century. These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan ) until the end of the 12th century.
The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka . The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called ""Chalukyan architecture"". Kannada literature , which had enjoyed royal support in the 9th century Rashtrakuta court found eager patronage from the Western Chalukyas in the Jain and Veerashaiva traditions. The 11th century saw the patronage of Telugu literature under the Eastern Chalukyas .
Origins

Old Kannada inscription on victory pillar, Virupaksha Temple, Pattadakal , 733–745 AD
While opinions vary regarding the early origins of the Chalukyas, the consensus among noted historians such as John Keay , D.C. Sircar , Hans Raj, S. Sen, Kamath , K. V. Ramesh and Karmarkar is that the founders of the empire at Badami were native to the modern Karnataka region. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
A theory that they were descendants of a 2nd-century chieftain called Kandachaliki Remmanaka, a feudatory of the Andhra Ikshvaku (from an Ikshvaku inscription of the 2nd century) was put forward. This according to Kamath has failed to explain the difference in lineage. The Kandachaliki feudatory call themselves Vashisthiputras of the Hiranyakagotra. The Chalukyas, however, address themselves as Harithiputras of Manavyasagotra in their inscriptions, which is the same lineage as their early overlords, the Kadambas of Banavasi. This makes them descendants of the Kadambas. The Chalukyas took control of the territory formerly ruled by the Kadambas. [14]
A later record of Eastern Chalukyas mentions the northern origin theory and claims one ruler of Ayodhya came south, defeated the Pallavas and married a Pallava princess. She had a child called Vijayaditya who is claimed to be the Pulakeshin I 's father. However, according to the historians K. V. Ramesh, Chopra and Sastri, there are Badami Chalukya inscriptions that confirm Jayasimha was Pulakeshin I's grandfather and Ranaraga , his father. [15] [16] [17] [18] Kamath and Moraes claim it was a popular practice in the 11th century to link South Indian royal family lineage to a Northern kingdom. The Badami Chalukya records themselves are silent with regards to the Ayodhya origin. [19] [20]
While the northern origin theory has been dismissed by many historians, the epigraphist K. V. Ramesh has suggested that an earlier southern migration is a distinct possibility which needs examination. [21] According to him, the complete absence of any inscriptional reference of their family connections to Ayodhya, and their subsequent Kannadiga identity may have been due to their earlier migration into present day Karnataka region where they achieved success as chieftains and kings. Hence, the place of origin of their ancestors may have been of no significance to the kings of the empire who may have considered themselves natives of the Kannada speaking region. [13] The writing of 12th century Kashmiri poet Bilhana suggests the Chalukya family belonged to the Shudra while other sources claim they were born in the arms of Brahma, and hence were Kshatriya caste. [22] According to Xuanzang , the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II was war-like and loved ""military arts"", because he was a Kshatriya by birth. [23]
The historians Jan Houben and Kamath, and the epigraphist D.C. Sircar note the Badami Chalukya inscriptions are in Kannada and Sanskrit . [24] [25] [26] According to the historian N. L. Rao, their inscriptions call them Karnatas and their names use indigenous Kannada titles such as Priyagallam and Noduttagelvom. The names of some Chalukya princes end with the pure Kannada term arasa (meaning ""king"" or ""chief""). [27] [28] The Rashtrakuta inscriptions call the Chalukyas of Badami Karnatakabala (""Power of Karnataka""). [29] It has been proposed by the historian S. C. Nandinath that the word ""Chalukya"" originated from Salki or Chalki which is a Kannada word for an agricultural implement. [30] [31] [32] According to some historians, the Chalukyas originated from agriculturists. [32] [30]
Historical sources
Inscriptions in Sanskrit and Kannada are the main source of information about Badami Chalukya history. Among them, the Badami cave inscriptions of Mangalesha (578), Kappe Arabhatta record of c. 700, Peddavaduguru inscription of Pulakeshin II , the Kanchi Kailasanatha Temple inscription and Pattadakal Virupaksha Temple inscription of Vikramaditya II (all in Kannada language) provide more evidence of the Chalukya language. [33] [34] The Badami cliff inscription of Pulakeshin I (543), the Mahakuta Pillar inscription of Mangalesha (595) and the Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II (634) are examples of important Sanskrit inscriptions written in old Kannada script . [35] [36] [37] The reign of the Chalukyas saw the arrival of Kannada as the predominant language of inscriptions along with Sanskrit, in areas of the Indian peninsula outside what is known as Tamilakam (Tamil country). [38] Several coins of the Badami Chalukyas with Kannada legends have been found. All this indicates that Kannada language flourished during this period. [39]

Travelogues of contemporary foreign travellers have provided useful information about the Chalukyan empire. The Chinese traveller Xuanzang had visited the court of Pulakeshin II . At the time of this visit, as mentioned in the Aihole record, Pulakeshin II had divided his empire into three Maharashtrakas or great provinces comprising 99,000 villages each. This empire possibly covered present day Karnataka , Maharashtra and coastal Konkan . [40] [41] Xuanzang, impressed with the governance of the empire observed that the benefits of the king's efficient administration was felt far and wide. Later, Persian emperor Khosrau II exchanged ambassadors with Pulakeshin II. [42] [43] [44]
Legends
Court poets of the Western Chalukya dynasty of Kalyani narrate:
""Once when Brahma, the creator, was engaged in the performance of the sandhya (twilight) rituals, Indra approached and beseeched him to create a hero who could put to an end the increasing evil on earth. On being thus requested, Brahma looked steadily into the Chuluka-jala (the water of oblation in his palm) and out sprang thence a great warrior, the progenitor of the Chalukyas"". [45] The Chalukyas claimed to have been nursed by the Sapta Matrikas (""seven divine mothers"") and were worshippers of many gods including Siva, Vishnu, Chamundi, Surya, Kubera, Parvati, Vinayaka and Kartikeya.
Some scholars connect the Chalukyas with the Chaulukyas (Solankis) of Gujarat . [46] According to a myth mentioned in latter manuscripts of Prithviraj Raso , Chaulukyas were born out of fire-pit (Agnikund) at Mount Abu . However it has been reported that the story of Agnikula is not mentioned at all in the original version of the Prithviraj Raso preserved in the Fort Library at Bikaner . [47]
According to the Nilagunda inscription of King Vikramaditya VI (11th century or later), the Chalukyas originally hailed from Ayodhya where fifty-nine kings ruled, and later, sixteen more of this family ruled from South India where they had migrated. This is repeated by his court poet Bilhana, who claims that the first member of the family, ""Chalukya"", was so named as he was born in the ""hollow of the hands"" of God Brahma . [48] [49] Some genealogical accounts point to an Ayodhya origin and claim that the Chalukyas belonged to the Solar dynasty . [50] [51] [52]
According to a theory put forward by Lewis, the Chalukya were descendants of the "" Seleukia "" tribe of Iraq and that their conflict with the Pallava of Kanchi was, but a continuation of the conflict between ancient Seleukia and "" Parthians "", the proposed ancestors of Pallavas . However, this theory has been rejected by Kamath as it seeks to build lineages based simply on similar-sounding clan names. [53]
Periods in Chalukya history
e
The Chalukyas ruled over the Deccan plateau in India for over 600 years. During this period, they ruled as three closely related, but individual dynasties. These are the ""Chalukyas of Badami"" (also called ""Early Chalukyas""), who ruled between the 6th and the 8th century, and the two sibling dynasties, the ""Chalukyas of Kalyani"" (also called Western Chalukyas or ""Later Chalukyas"") and the ""Chalukyas of Vengi"" (also called Eastern Chalukyas ).
Chalukyas of Badami
Bhutanatha temple complex , at Badami
In the 6th century, with the decline of the Gupta dynasty and their immediate successors in northern India, major changes began to happen in the area south of the Vindhyas – the Deccan and Tamilakam . The age of small kingdoms had given way to large empires in this region. [54] The Chalukya dynasty was established by Pulakeshin I in 543. [55] [56] [57] Pulakeshin I took Vatapi (modern Badami in Bagalkot district, Karnataka ) under his control and made it his capital. Pulakeshin I and his descendants are referred to as ""Chalukyas of Badami"". They ruled over an empire that comprised the entire state of Karnataka and most of Andhra Pradesh in the Deccan.
Pulakeshin II , whose pre-coronation name was Ereya, [58] commanded control over the entire Deccan and is perhaps the most well-known emperor of the Badami dynasty. [59] [60] He is considered one of the notable kings in Indian history. [61] [62] [63] His queens were princess from the Alupa Dynasty of South Canara and the Western Ganga Dynasty of Talakad , clans with whom the Chalukyas maintained close family and marital relationships. [64] [65] Pulakeshin II extended the Chalukya Empire up to the northern extents of the Pallava kingdom and halted the southward march of Harsha by defeating him on the banks of the river Narmada . He then defeated the Vishnukundins in the south-eastern Deccan. [66] [67] [68] [69] Pallava Narasimhavarman however reversed this victory in 642 by attacking and occupying Badami temporarily. It is presumed Pulakeshin II, ""the great hero"", died fighting. [43] [70]
The Badami Chalukya dynasty went into a brief decline following the death of Pulakeshin II due to internal feuds when Badami was occupied by the Pallavas for a period of thirteen years. [71] [72] It recovered during the reign of Vikramaditya I , who succeeded in pushing the Pallavas out of Badami and restoring order to the empire. Vikramaditya I took the title ""Rajamalla"" (lit ""Sovereign of the Mallas"" or Pallavas). [73] The thirty-seven year rule of Vijayaditya (696–733) was a prosperous one and is known for prolific temple building activity. [74] [75]
The empire was its peak again during the rule of the illustrious Vikramaditya II (733–744) who is known not only for his repeated invasions of the territory of Tondaimandalam and his subsequent victories over Pallava Nandivarman II , but also for his benevolence towards the people and the monuments of Kanchipuram, the Pallava capital. [74] [76] [77] He thus avenged the earlier humiliation of the Chalukyas by the Pallavas and engraved a Kannada inscription on the victory pillar at the Kailasanatha Temple. [76] [78] [79] During his reign Arab intruders of the Caliphal province of Sind invaded southern Gujarat which was under Chalukya rule, but the Arabs were defeated and driven out by Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin , the governor of the Chalukya branch of Navsari . [80] Vikramaditya II later overran the other traditional kingdoms of Tamil country, the Pandyas , the Cholas and the Cheras in addition to subduing a Kalabhra ruler. [81] The last Chalukya king, Kirtivarman II , was overthrown by the Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga in 753. [82] At their peak, the Chalukyas ruled a vast empire stretching from the Kaveri in the south to the Narmada in the north.

The Chalukyas and contemporary polities c. 576
The Chalukyas revived their fortunes in 973 after over 200 years of dormancy when much of the Deccan was under the rule of the Rashtrakutas. The genealogy of the kings of this empire is still debated. One theory, based on contemporary literary and inscriptional evidence plus the finding that the Western Chalukyas employed titles and names commonly used by the early Chalukyas, suggests that the Western Chalukya kings belonged to the same family line as the illustrious Badami Chalukya dynasty of the 6th century [83] [84] while other Western Chalukya inscriptional evidence indicates they were a distinct line unrelated to the Early Chalukyas. [85]
Tailapa II , a Rashtrakuta feudatory ruling from Tardavadi – 1000 ( Bijapur district ) overthrew Karka II , re-established the Chalukya rule in the western Deccan and recovered most of the Chalukya empire. [86] [87] The Western Chalukyas ruled for over 200 years and were in constant conflict with the Cholas , and with their cousins, the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi. Vikramaditya VI is widely considered the most notable ruler of the dynasty. [88] [89] Starting from the very beginning of his reign, which lasted fifty years, he abolished the original Saka era and established the Vikrama Era. Most subsequent Chalukya inscriptions are dated in this new era. [90] [91] Vikramaditya VI was an ambitious and skilled military leader. Under his leadership the Western Chalukyas were able to end the Chola influence over Vengi (coastal Andhra) and become the dominant power in the Deccan. [92] [93] The Western Chalukya period was an important age in the development of Kannada literature and Sanskrit literature . [94] [95] They went into their final dissolution towards the end of the 12th century with the rise of the Hoysala Empire , the Pandyas , the Kakatiya and the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri . [96]
Chalukyas of Vengi
Main article: Eastern Chalukyas
Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. [97] [98] Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. [99] After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam . [98] [100]
After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. [101] Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas. [101]
The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I . [102] This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful. [101] [103]
Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and literature, though, after a period of time, local factors took over and they gave importance to Telugu language . [104] [105] Telugu literature owes its growth to the Eastern Chalukyas. [106]
Architecture

The Badami Chalukya era was an important period in the development of South Indian architecture. The kings of this dynasty were called Umapati Varlabdh and built many temples for the Hindu god Shiva. [107] Their style of architecture is called ""Chalukyan architecture"" or ""Karnata Dravida architecture"". [108] [109] Nearly a hundred monuments built by them, rock cut (cave) and structural, are found in the Malaprabha river basin in modern Bagalkot district of northern Karnataka. [110] The building material they used was a reddish-golden Sandstone found locally. These cave temples are basically excavations, cut out of the living rock sites they occupy. They were not built as their structural counterparts were, rather created by a special technique known as ""subtraction"" and are basically sculptural. [111] Though they ruled a vast empire, the Chalukyan workshops concentrated most of their temple building activity in a relatively small area within the Chalukyan heartland – Aihole , Badami , Pattadakal and Mahakuta in modern Karnataka state. [112]
Their temple building activity can be categorised into three phases. The early phase began in the last quarter of the 6th century and resulted in many cave temples, prominent among which are three elementary cave temples at Aihole (one Vedic , one Jain and one Buddhist which is incomplete), followed by four developed cave temples at Badami (of which cave 3, a Vaishnava temple, is dated accurately to 578 CE). [113] These cave temples at Badami are similar, in that, each has a plain exterior but an exceptionally well finished interior consisting of a pillared verandah , a columned hall ( mantapa ) and a cella (shrine, cut deep into rock) which contains the deity of worship. [114] In Badami, three caves temples are Vedic and one in Jain. The Vedic temples contain large well sculpted images of Harihara , Mahishasuramardhini , Varaha , Narasimha , Trivikrama, Vishnu seated on Anantha (the snake) and Nataraja (dancing Shiva ). [115]
The second phase of temple building was at Aihole (where some seventy structures exist and has been called ""one of the cradles of Indian temple architecture"" [116] ) and Badami. Though the exact dating of these temples has been debated, there is consensus that the beginnings of these constructions are from c. 600. [117] [118] [119] These are the Lad Khan Temple (dated by some to c. 450 but more accurately to 620) with its interesting perforated stone windows and sculptures of river goddesses; the Meguti Jain Temple (634) which shows progress in structural design; the Durga Temple with its northern Indian style tower (8th century) and experiments to adapt a Buddhist Chaitya design to a brahminical one (its stylistic framework is overall a hybrid of north and south Indian styles. [107] ); the Huccimalli Gudi Temple with a new inclusion, a vestibule , connecting the sanctum to the hall. [120] Other dravida style temples from this period are the Naganatha Temple at Nagaral; the Banantigudi Temple, the Mahakutesvara Temple and the Mallikarjuna Temple at Mahakuta; and the Lower Sivalaya Temple, the Malegitti Sivalaya Temple (upper) and the Jambulingesvara Temple at Badami. [118] Located outside the Chalukyan architectural heartland, 140 km south-east of Badami, with a structure related to the Early Chalukya style is the unusual Parvati Temple at Sanduru which dates to the late 7th century. It is medium-sized, 48 ft long and 37 ft wide. It has a nagara (north Indian) style vimana (tower) and dravida (south Indian) style parts, has no mantapa (hall) and consists of an antarala ( vestibule ) crowned with a barrel-vaulted tower (sukhanasi). The ""staggered"" base plan of the temple became popular much later, in the 11th century. [121] [122]
The structural temples at Pattadakal, built in the 8th century and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site , marks the culmination and mature phase of Badami Chalukyan architecture. The Bhutanatha group of temples at Badami are also from this period. There are ten temples at Pattadakal, six in southern dravida style and four in the northern nagara style. Well known among these are the Sangamesvara Temple (725), the Virupaksha Temple (740–745) and the Mallikarjuna Temple (740–745) in the southern style. The Papanatha temple (680) and Galaganatha Temple (740) are early attempts in the nagara – dravida fusion style. [123] Inscriptional evidence suggests that the Virupaksha and the Mallikarjuna Temples were commissioned by the two queens of King Vikramaditya II after his military success over the Pallavas of Kanchipuram. [118] Some well known names of Chalukyan architects are Revadi Ovajja, Narasobba and Anivarita Gunda . [124]
The reign of Western Chalukyas was an important period in the development of Deccan architecture. Their architecture served as a conceptual link between the Badami Chalukya architecture of the 8th century and the Hoysala architecture popularised in the 13th century. [125] [126] The centre of their cultural and temple-building activity lay in the Tungabhadra region of modern Karnataka state, encompassing the present-day Dharwad district ; it included areas of present-day Haveri and Gadag districts. [127] [128] Here, large medieval workshops built numerous monuments. [129] These monuments, regional variants of pre-existing dravida temples, defined the Karnata dravida tradition. [130]
The most notable of the many buildings dating from this period are the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district , [131] [132] the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi in the Gadag district , [133] [134] the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti, [134] and the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali, [135] both in the Davangere district . [136] Other notable constructions are the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal (Gadag district), [137] [138] the Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri ( Haveri district ), [139] [140] and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri ( Dharwad district ). [141] [142] The Eastern Chalukyas built some fine temples at Alampur, in modern eastern Andhra Pradesh. [113] [143]

Literature
See also: Western Chalukya literature
Poetry on stone at the Meguti temple ( Aihole inscription ) dated 634 AD, in Sanskrit language and old Kannada script, with a Kannada language endorsement of about the same date at the bottom. [24]
The Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II (634) written by his court poet Ravikirti in Sanskrit language and Kannada script is considered as a classical piece of poetry. [35] [144] A few verses of a poet named Vijayanaka who describes herself as the ""dark Sarasvati "" have been preserved. It is possible that she may have been a queen of prince Chandraditya (a son of Pulakeshin II). [145] Famous writers in Sanskrit from the Western Chalukya period are Vijnaneshwara who achieved fame by writing Mitakshara , a book on Hindu law, and King Someshvara III , a noted scholar, who compiled an encyclopaedia of all arts and sciences called Manasollasa. [146]
From the period of the Badami Chalukyas, references are made to the existence of Kannada literature, though not much has survived. [147] Inscriptions however refer to Kannada as the ""natural language"". [148] The Kappe Arabhatta record of c. 700 in tripadi (three line) metre is the earliest available work in Kannada poetics. [149] [150] Karnateshwara Katha, which was quoted later by Jayakirti, is believed to be a eulogy of Pulakeshin II and to have belonged to this period. [150] Other probable Kannada writers, whose works are not extant now but titles of which are known from independent references [151] are Syamakundacharya (650), who is said to have authored the Prabhrita, and Srivaradhadeva (also called Tumubuluracharya, 650 or earlier), the possible author of the Chudamani (""Crest Jewel""), a lengthy commentary on logic . [147] [152] [153] [154]
The rule of the Western and Eastern Chalukyas, however, is a major event in the history of Kannada and Telugu literatures respectively. By the 9th–10th centuries, Kannada language had already seen some of its most notable writers. The ""three gems"" of Kannada literature , Adikavi Pampa , Sri Ponna and Ranna belonged to this period. [155] [156] In the 11th century, Telugu literature was born under the patronage of the Eastern Chalukyas with Nannaya Bhatta as its first writer. [156] [157]
Badami Chalukya country
Army
The army was well organised and this was the reason for Pulakeshin II's success beyond the Vindyas. [158] It consisted of an infantry, a cavalry, an elephant corps and a powerful navy. The Chinese traveller Hiuen-Tsiang wrote that the Chalukyan army had hundreds of elephants which were intoxicated with liquor prior to battle. [43] [159] It was with their navy that they conquered Revatidvipa ( Goa ), and Puri on east coast of India. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use the term Karnatakabala when referring to the powerful Chalukya armies. [160] [29]
Land governance
The government, at higher levels, was closely modelled after the Magadhan and Satavahana administrative machinery. [43] The empire was divided into Maharashtrakas (provinces), then into smaller Rashtrakas (Mandala), Vishaya (district), Bhoga (group of 10 villages) which is similar to the Dasagrama unit used by the Kadambas . At the lower levels of administration, the Kadamba style prevailed fully. The Sanjan plates of Vikramaditya I even mentions a land unit called Dasagrama. [161] In addition to imperial provinces, there were autonomous regions ruled by feudatories such as the Alupas, the Gangas , the Banas and the Sendrakas. [162] Local assemblies and guilds looked after local issues. Groups of mahajanas (learned brahmins ) looked after agraharas (called ghatika or ""place of higher learning"") such as at Badami which was served by 2000 mahajans and Aihole which was served by 500 mahajanas. Taxes were levied and were called the herjunka – tax on loads, the kirukula – tax on retail goods in transit, the bilkode – sales tax, the pannaya – betel tax, siddaya – land tax and the vaddaravula – tax levied to support royalty. [162]
Coinage
The Badami Chalukyas minted coins that were of a different standard compared to the coins of the northern kingdoms. [163] The coins had Nagari and Kannada legends. [25] The coins of Mangalesha had the symbol of a temple on the obverse and a 'sceptre between lamps' or a temple on the reverse. Pulakeshin II's coins had a caparisoned lion facing right on the obverse and a temple on the reverse. The coins weighed 4 grams and were called, in old-Kannada, hun (or honnu) and had fractions such as fana (or fanam) and the quarter fana (the modern day Kannada equivalent being hana – which literally means ""money""). [164] A gold coin called gadyana is mentioned in a record at the Vijayeshwara Temple at Pattadakal , which later came to be known as varaha (their royal emblem). [163]

Status

The Kakatiya dynasty ( IAST : Kākatīya) [a] was a Telugu dynasty that ruled most of eastern Deccan region in present-day India between 12th and 14th centuries. [6] Their territory comprised much of the present day Telangana and Andhra Pradesh , and parts of eastern Karnataka , northern Tamil Nadu , and southern Odisha . [7] [8] Their capital was Orugallu, now known as Warangal .
Early Kakatiya rulers served as feudatories to Rashtrakutas and Western Chalukyas for more than two centuries. They assumed sovereignty under Prataparudra I in 1163 CE by suppressing other Chalukya subordinates in the Telangana region. [9] Ganapati Deva (r. 1199–1262) significantly expanded Kakatiya lands during the 1230s and brought under Kakatiya control the Telugu-speaking lowland delta areas around the Godavari and Krishna rivers. Ganapati Deva was succeeded by Rudrama Devi (r. 1262–1289) who is one of the few queens in Indian history. Marco Polo , who visited India around 1289–1293, made note of Rudrama Devi's rule and nature in flattering terms. She successfully repelled the attacks of Yadavas (Seuna) of Devagiri into the Kakatiyan territory. [9]
In 1303, Alauddin Khalji , the emperor of the Delhi Sultanate invaded the Kakatiya territory which ended up as a disaster for the Turks. [b] But after the successful siege of Warangal in 1310, Prataparudra II was forced to pay annual tribute to Delhi. Another attack by Ulugh Khan (i.e. Tughluq) in 1323 saw stiff resistance by the Kakatiyan army, but they were finally defeated. The demise of the Kakatiya dynasty resulted in confusion and anarchy under alien rulers for some time, before Musunuri Nayakas united the various Telugu clans and recovered Warangal from the Delhi Sultanate . [10]
Kakatiyas unified the distinct upland and lowland cultures of Telugu lands, which brought into being a feeling of cultural affinity between those who spoke the Telugu language . Kakatiya period also saw the construction of reservoirs for irrigation in the uplands called ""tanks"" many of which are still used today. They were egalitarian in nature and anyone, regardless of birth, could acquire the nayaka title that denoted the warrior status. They recruited peasants into the military which resulted in a new warrior class and provided social mobility. Kakatiya era also saw the development of a distinct style of architecture that improved and innovated upon the existing modes. [11] Most notable examples are the Thousand Pillar Temple in Hanamkonda , Ramappa Temple in Palampet, Warangal Fort , Golconda Fort and Kota Gullu in Ghanpur .
Etymology and names
Studies of the inscriptions and coinage by the historian Dineshchandra Sircar reveal that there was no contemporary standard spelling of the family name. Variants include Kakatiya, Kakatiyya, Kakita, Kakati and Kakatya. The family name was often prefixed to the name of the monarch, giving constructs such as Kakatiya-Prataparudra. Some of the monarchs also had alternate names; for example, Venkata and Venkataraya may have been alternate names of Prataparuda I, with the former appearing on a coin in the form Venkata-Kakatiya. [12] [c]
According to Kakatiya inscriptions, the family's name derives from the name of a place called Kakati. However, Kumarasvami Somapithin, in his 15th-century commentary on Vidynatha's Prataparudra-Yashobhushanam or Prataparudriya states that the family was named after their tutelary goddess Kakati, a form of Durga . [13] [14] It is possible that the early Kakatiya chiefs resided at a place called Kakati, which had a shrine of their tutelary goddess. [15] [16]
Although the Hindu mythological texts do not mention any such form of Durga, the worship of a goddess named Kakati is attested by several other sources. For example, Vallabharaya's Krida-bhiramamu mentions an image of Kakatamma (""Mother Kakati"") in the Kakatiya capital Orugallu. The 16th century Shitap Khan inscription mentions the reinstallation of the image of goddess Jaganmatruka (mother of the universe) and the lotus seat of the Kakatirajya, which had been destroyed by the Turushkas (Turkic people). [17] According to one theory, Kakati was originally a Jain goddess (possibly Padmavati ) and later came to be regarded as a form of Durga. [14]
The Bayyaram tank inscription from the reign of Ganapati-deva states that the Kakatiya chief Venna (c. 9th century) resided at Kakati, because of which his descendants came to be known as Kakatishas (""lords of Kakati""). [18] Ganapati-deva's Garavapadu charter traces the family's ancestry to Durjaya , a legendary chieftain of ancient Andhra, arrived at a town called Kakati during a hunting expedition, and set up his camp there. [16] The modern identity of Kakati is uncertain: different historians have variously attempted to identify it with modern Kakati village in Karnataka and Kanker in Chhattisgarh . Siddheshvara-Charitra, a later literary work, states that the ancestors of the Kakatiya family lived at Kandarapura (identified with modern Kandhar in Maharashtra ). However, no other evidence supports this tradition. [19] Later, the Kakatiya capital Orugallu (present-day Warangal) was also called ""Kakati-pura"" (""Kakati town""), as attested by some inscriptions of the dynasty. [15]

Much of the information about the Kakatiya period comes from inscriptions, including around 1,000 stone inscriptions, and 12 copper-plate inscriptions. [20] Most of these inscriptions document matters relating to religion, such as donations to Hindu temples. They are particularly abundant for the period 1175–1324 CE, which is the period when the dynasty most flourished and are a reflection of that. The probability is that many inscriptions have been lost due to buildings falling into disuse and also the ravages of subsequent rulers, most notably the Muslim Mughal Empire in the Telangana region. Inscriptions are still being discovered today but governmental agencies tend to concentrate on recording those that are already known rather than searching for new examples. [21] A 1978 book written by P.V.P. Sastry on the history of the Kakatiyas, published by the Government of Andhra Pradesh also constitutes one of the sources. Tamil stone inscription from Kakatiya king Prataparudra was found in Motupalli , Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh. [22]
Information about the Kakatiya period also comes from Sanskrit and Telugu literary works written during Kakatiya and post-Kakatiya period. The most notable among these works include Prataparudriyam, Krida-bhiramamu, Panditaradhya-charitamu, Sivayogasaramu, Nitisara, Niti-sastra-muktavali, Nrutya-ratnavali, Pratapa-charita, Siddhesvara-charitra, Somadeva-rajiyamu, Palnativira-charitra, Velugotivari-vamsavali, and Velugotivari-vamsacharitra. [23] Chronicles by Muslim authors such as Isami and Firishta describe Prataparudra's defeats against the Muslim armies. The Kannada text Kumara-Ramana-charita also provides information about Prataparudra's relations with the Kampili kingdom . [24]
Besides epigraphs and literature, the forts, temples and tanks constructed during the Kakatiya period are an important source of information about contemporary society, art and architecture. [25]
History
Origin
The Kakatiya rulers traced their ancestry to a legendary chief or ruler named Durjaya . [16] Many other ruling dynasties of Andhra also claimed descent from Durjaya. Nothing further is known about this chief. [26]
Most of the Kakatiya records do not mention the Varna (social class) of the family, but the majority of the ones that do, proudly describe them as Shudra . [27] Examples include the Bothpur and Vaddamanu inscriptions of Ganapati's general Malyala Gunda senani. The Kakatiyas also maintained marital relations with other Shudra families, such as the Kotas and the Natavadi chiefs. All this evidence indicates that the Kakatiyas were of Shudra origin. [28]
A few copper-plate inscriptions of the Kakatiya family describe them as belonging to the Kshatriya (warrior) varna. These inscriptions primarily document grants to Brahmans , and appear to be inspired by the genealogies of the Imperial Cholas . [27] For example, the Motupalli inscription of Ganapati counts legendary solar dynasty kings such as Rama among the ancestors of Durjaya, the progenitor of the Kakatiya family. The Malkapuram inscription of Visvesvara Sivacharya, the preceptor of Kakatiya rulers Ganapati-deva and Rudrama-devi, also connects the Kakatiyas to the solar dynasty (Sūryavaṃsa). [29] The term ""Kshatriya"" in these panegyric records appears to signify the family's warrior-like qualities rather than their actual varna. [30]
Relationship to the Rashtrakutas
Kubera, Hoysala-Kakatiya period, 1100-1350 CE.
According to an interpretation of the Mangallu and the Bayyaram inscriptions, the Kakatiyas were not just Rashtrakuta vassals, but also a branch of the Rashtrakuta family. [31]
The 956 CE Mangallu inscription was issued by the Vengi Chalukya prince Dānārnava, at the request of the Kakatiya chief Gunda IV . [32] The inscription names Gundyana's ancestors as Gundiya-Rashtrakuta ( Gunda III ) and Eriya-Rashtrakuta ( Erra ). [33] This suggests that Gunda IV was a Rashtrakuta general, and not a Vengi Chalukya subordinate, as assumed by some earlier historians. [33]
The Bayyaram tank inscription, which records the construction of the Dharma-kirti-samudra tank by Ganapati's sister Mailama (or Mailamba), provides another genealogical list. [34] The similarities of names mentioned in the Mangallu and Bayyaram inscriptions lists suggest that both of these refer to the same family: [35]

The significance of the suffix ""Rashtrakuta"" in the names of the early Kakatiya chiefs is debated. According to one theory, the suffix only implies that these chiefs were Rashtrakuta's subordinates. This theory is based on the fact that the phrase Rashtrakuta-kutumbinah appears in several Rashtrakuta-era copper-plate inscriptions, and refers to the officers and subjects of the Rashtrakuta kingdom. [37]
According to another theory, the suffix implies that the Kakatiyas were a branch of the Rashtrakuta family because the term Rashtrakuta-kutumbinah was used for officers employed by the Rashtrakuta administration, not feudatory chiefs: the early records of the Kakatiya chiefs describe them as samantas (feudatory chiefs). [38] The Kazipet Darga inscription of Durgaraja states that his father Beta II was born in the family of Samanta Viṣṭi. [39] Historian P.V.P. Sastry theorises that ""Viṣṭi"" is a corruption of Vrishni , the name of a clan from which some Rashtrakutas claimed descent. He notes that some chiefs of Rashtrakuta origin adopted the title ""Viṭṭi-narayana"", which means ""as great as Narayana ( Krishna ) of the Vitti (Vrishni) family. [40] Sastry further proposes that the term ""Voddi"", which appears in the phrase Voddi-kula (""Voddi family"") in the Mangallu inscription may be same as ""Viṣṭi"". [41] Sastry also believes that the early Kakatiya chiefs followed Jainism , which was also patronized by the Rashtrakutas, thus strengthening the view that the two dynasties were connected (see Religion section below). [14]
The Kakatiyas seemed to have adopted the mythical bird Garuda as their royal insignia, as attested by the Ekamranatha temple inscription of Ganapati-deva, the Palampet inscription of the Kakatiya general Recharla Rudra , and Vidyanatha's Prataparudriya. [39] The Bayyaram tank inscription calls the Kakatiya chief Beta I (son of Gunda IV) Garudamka-Beta, and ""Garuda"" here appears to refer to the family's emblem. [42] In Hindu mythology, Garuda is the vahana of god Vishnu . The Rashtrakutas and some other dynasties of Deccan claimed descent from the Vrishni clan (associated with Vishnu's avatar Krishna ) and had adopted Garuda as their royal insignia. [38] According to Sastry, this corroborates the theory that the Kakatiyas were associated with the Rashtrakuta family. [5] Sastry further speculates that the Kakatiyas may have adopted the Garuda symbol because of Jain influence: the yaksha of the Jain tirthankara Shantinatha is represented by the Garuda symbol. [5] However, when the Kakatiyas switched their allegiance to the Chalukyas of Kalyani , they also adopted the varaha symbol used by the Chalukyas. [43]
Based on Ganapati-deva's Garavapadu inscription, which names Karikala Chola among the family's ancestors, epigraphist C.R.K. Charlu theorised that the Kakatiyas were a branch of the Telugu Chodas . However, no other Kakatiya record mentions Karikala, and unlike the Telugu Chodas, the Kakatiyas did not claim to belong to the Kashyapa - gotra . Therefore, Sastry dismisses Charlu's theory as untenable. [41]
Early feudatory chiefs
The regnal years of the early members of the Kakatiya family are not certain. The earliest known Kakatiya chief is Venna or Vanna (r. c. 800-815), who claimed descent from Durjaya ,  legendary chieftain of ancient Andhra. According to Kakatiya inscriptions, he ruled from a town called Kakati, because of which his family was called Kakatishas (""lords of Kakati""). Not much is known about his successors Gunda I and Gunda II, who ruled during c. 815-865 CE. [44] The Bayyaram tank inscription compares his successors - Gunda I, Gunda II, and Gunda III - to the three Ramas ( Parashurama , Dasharatha-Rama , and Balarama ).
The c. 956 CE Mangallu inscription suggests that the Kakatiyas came to the Telugu -speaking region as commanders of the Rashtrakuta armies. [15] The earliest of these was Venna's son Gunda III , who died during Krishna II 's invasion of the Vengi Chalukya kingdom around 895 CE. [45] Krishna II captured the Kurravadi (possibly present-day Kuravi ) region from the Vengi Chalukyas, and probably appointed Gunda III's son Erra as a governor there. Not much is known about Erra's son Betiya. [46]
As a Rashtrakuta vassal, Betiya's son Gunda IV (r. c. 955-995) helped the Vengi Chalukya prince Danarnava ascend the throne after a succession dispute. In 973 CE, after the collapse of the Rashtrakuta empire and the murder of Danarnava, he attempted to carve out an independent principality at Kuravi . The Mudugonda Chalukyas, whom he had displaced from Kuravi, sought help from the Kalyani Chalukyas , who had usurped the power from the Rashtrakutas. The Kalyani Chalukya forces probably defeated and killed Gunda IV. [47] His son Beta I (r. c. 1000-1052 CE) accepted the Kalyani Chalukya suzerainty and received from them the fief of Anumakonda (modern Hanamakonda), which later became the Kakatiya capital. He distinguished himself in the Chalukya campaigns against the Cholas, during the reign of Someshvara I . [48]
Prola I (r. c. 1052-1076), the son of Beta I, participated in various Chalukya military campaigns, consolidated the Kakatiya control around Anumakonda by defeating local chiefs, and obtained Anumakonda as a hereditary fief. [49] [50] The Chalukya king granted his son Beta II (r. c. 996-1051) the Sabbi-1000 province (the historical Sabbi-nadu region with 1000 villages, centred around Vemulavada ). [51] He was succeeded by his sons, first Durga-raja  and then Prola II (r. c. 1116–1157). [52]
After the decline of the Rashtrakuta power, the Kakatiyas served as vassals of the Kalyani Chalukyas . After the decline of the Chalukya power in the 12th century, they assumed sovereignty by suppressing other Chalukya subordinates in the Telangana region. [53]

The 1149 Sanigaram inscription of Prola II is the last known record of the Kakatiyas as vassals. The 1163 Anumakonda inscription of Rudradeva alias Prataparudra I is the earliest known record that describes the Kakatiyas as a sovereign power. [56]
According to Sastry, Prataparudra I reigned between around 1158 – 1195, [52] while Sircar gives the dates 1163–1195. He was also known as Rudra Deva, Kakatiya Rudradeva, Venkata, and Venkataraya [12] [57] He was the son of Prola II, who had made efforts to assert greater Kakatiya influence on territories in the eastern parts of the declining Western Chalukyan empire and who died in a battle fought against the Velanati Choda ruler Gonka II around 1157/1158 while doing so. [58] [59] It was during Prataparudra's reign, in 1163, that the Kakatiyas declared an end to their status as feudatory chiefs of the Chalukyas. [d] It is notable that inscriptions were henceforth written using the Kakatiya chiefs' vernacular Telugu rather than the Kannada language that had prevailed until that point. [60]
Mahadeva succeeded Prataparudra I as king, reigning probably from 1195 to 1199. [52]
Ganapati
Just as the Yadava and Hoysala dynasties took control of linguistically related areas during the 13th century, so too did the Kakatiyas under the rule of Ganapati. [60] He is also known as Ganapathi Deva and, according to Sastry, reigned between 1199 and 1262; Sircar gives regnal dates of 1199–1260. [52] [57] He significantly expanded Kakatiya lands during the 1230s when he launched a series of attacks outside the dynasty's traditional Telangana region and thus brought under Kakatiya control the Telugu-speaking lowland delta areas around the Godavari and Krishna rivers. The outcome in the case of all three dynasties, says historian Richard Eaton, was that they ""catalysed processes of supralocal identity formation and community building"". [60]
The Kakatiya capital at Orugallu, established in 1195, was not forgotten while Ganapati expanded his territory. He organised the building of a massive granite wall around the city, complete with ramps designed for ease of access to its ramparts from within. A moat and numerous bastions were also constructed. [61]
Ganapati was keen to bolster the dynasty's economy. He encouraged merchants to trade abroad, abolishing all taxes except for a fixed duty and supporting those who risked their lives to travel afar. [62] He created the man-made Pakhal Lake .
Rudrama Devi
Statue of Rudrama Devi .
Rudrama Devi , also known as Rudramadevi, reigned around 1262–1289 CE (alternative dates: 1261–1295 CE) and is one of the few queens in Indian history. [52] [63] [64] Sources disagree regarding whether she was the widow of Ganapati or his daughter. [65]
Marco Polo , who visited India probably sometime around 1289–1293, made note of Rudrama Devi's rule and nature in flattering terms. [66] [e] She continued the planned fortification of the capital, raising the height of Ganapati's wall as well as adding a second earthen curtain wall 1.5 miles (2.4 km) in diameter and with an additional 150 feet (46 m)-wide moat. [61]
A fragmentary Kannada language inscription also states that the Kakatiya general Bhairava defeated the Yadava army probably in or after 1263 CE, which may be a reference to his repulsion of Mahadeva 's invasion. A coin of Mahadeva bears the Kakatiya emblem varaha with the Yadava symbols; this varaha may have been stuck on Mahadeva's coins to mark the Kakatiya victory. [9]
Rudrama was married to Virabhadra, an Eastern Chalukyan prince of Nidadavolu who had been selected for that purpose by her father. [67] Having no son as an heir, [61] Rudrama abdicated in favour of her grandson when it became apparent that the expansionist sultan Alauddin Khalji was encroaching on the Deccan and might in due course attack the Kakatiyas. [65]
Prataparudra II
The earliest biography of Rudrama Devi's successor, Prataparudra II , is the Prataparudra Caritramu, dating from the 16th century. [68] His reign began in 1289 (alternative date: 1295) and ended with the demise of the dynasty in 1323. [52] [64] It is described by Eaton as the ""first chapter in a larger story"" that saw the style of polity in the Deccan change from being regional kingdoms to transregional sultanates that survived until the arrival of the British East India Company in the 18th century. [69]
Decline
A replica of the Koh-i-Noor diamond. The diamond was originally owned by the Kakatiya dynasty.
The Kakatiya kingdom attracted the attention of the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji because of the possibility of plunder. [70] The first foray into the Kakatiya kingdom was made in 1303 by Malik Chajju, the nephew of the Indian Muslim Wazir Nusrat Khan Jalesari of Delhi, and Fakhruddin Jauna , [71] [72] which was a disaster due to the resistance of the Kakatiya army in the Battle of Upparapalli . [73] [f] In 1309 the Gujarati general, Malik Kafur , [74] in an attempt to force Prataparudra into acceptance of a position subordinate to the sultanate at Delhi. Kafur organised a month-long siege of Orugallu that ended with success in February 1310. Prataparudra was forced to make various symbolic acts of obeisance designed to demonstrate his new position as a subordinate but, as was Alauddin's plan, he was not removed as ruler of the area but rather forced thereafter to pay annual tribute to Delhi. [75] It was probably at this time that the Koh-i-Noor diamond passed from Kakatiya ownership to that of Alauddin, along with 20,000 horses and 100 elephants. [70]
In 1311, Prataparudra formed a part of the sultanate forces that attacked the Pandyan empire in the south, and he took advantage of that situation to quell some of his vassals in Nellore who had seen his reduced status as an opportunity for independence. Later, though, in 1318, he failed to provide the annual tribute to Delhi, claiming that the potential for being attacked on the journey made it impossible. The succeeding Sultan Mubarak Shah responded by sending another of his Gujarati generals, Khusrau Khan , [76] to Orugallu with a force that bristled with technology previously unknown in the area, including trebuchet -like machines. Prataparudra had to submit once more , with his obeisance on this occasion being arranged by the sultanate to include a very public display whereby he bowed towards Delhi from the ramparts of Orugallu. The amount of his annual tribute was changed, becoming 100 elephants and 12,000 horses. [77]
The new arrangements did not last long. Taking advantage of a revolution in Delhi that saw the Khalji dynasty removed and the Punjab-born Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq installed as sultan, [78] Prataparudra again asserted his independence in 1320. Tughlaq sent his son, Jauna Khan , to defeat the defiant Kakatiya king in 1321. Khan's army was riven with internal dissension due to rumours of the king's death, which caused many officers to leave the army. [79] This caused the siege on this occasion to last much longer — six months, rather than the few weeks that had previously been the case. The attackers were initially repulsed and Khan's forces retreated to regroup in Devagiri. Prataparudra celebrated the apparent victory by opening up his grain stores for public feasting. Khan returned in 1323 with his revitalised and reinforced army and, with few supplies left, Prataparudra was forced into submission after a five-month siege. The unprepared and battle-weary army of Orugallu was finally defeated, and Orugallu was renamed Sultanpur. It seems probable, from combining various contemporary and near-contemporary accounts, that Prataparudra committed suicide near the Narmada River while being taken as a prisoner to Delhi. [80] [81]
Characterization
Geography
The Kakatiya base was the city of Orugallu [82] in the dry uplands of northern Telangana on the Deccan Plateau . From there they expanded their influence into Coastal Andhra , the delta between the Godavari and Krishna rivers that feed into the Bay of Bengal . According to Rao and Shulman, the latter contained a high proportion of Brahmins while the former was the haunt of ""peasants, artisans and warriors"". [83] Under the Kakatiyas, cultural innovation often began in the uplands, was refined in the lowlands and then recycled back into the Deccan. This bi-directional flow of cultural influences brought into being a feeling of cultural affinity between those who spoke the Telugu language where nothing of that nature had previously existed. [g] The unification of the distinct upland and lowland cultures was their most significant political achievement, achieved through a process of binding many locally powerful figures in allegiance to the empire. [82]
The area of land under Kakatiya control reached its zenith around the 13th century CE during the rule of Ganapati Deva. By this time, South India and the Deccan were essentially under the aegis of four Hindu monarchies , of which the Kakatiyas were one. [h] The four dynasties were in a constant state of warfare with each other, with the Kakatiyas eventually exercising control from close to Anagondi in the west to Kalyani in the north-east, and down to Kanei and Ganjam district in southern Orissa . [7]
Architecture
13th century Ramappa Temple in Telangana .
A notable trend during the dynastic period was the construction of reservoirs for irrigation in the uplands, around 5000 of which were built by warrior families subordinate to the Kakatiyas. This dramatically altered the possibilities for development in the sparsely populated dry areas. Many of these edifices, often called ""tanks"", including the large examples at Pakala and Ramappa, are still used today. [84]
Another notable architectural feature of the dynasty relates to temples. Even before the arrival of the dynasty, there were large, well-established and well-endowed Hindu places of worship in the relatively populous delta areas; however, the temples of the uplands, which were smaller and less cosmopolitan in origin and funding, did not exist until the Kakatiya period. In the lowlands, where Brahmins were numerous, the temples had long benefited from a desire to build social networks for the purposes of domestic and foreign trade, as well as for obtaining grazing rights in the face of competition; in the uplands, the endowment of the buildings was often associated with the construction and continued maintenance of reservoirs and enabled a different type of networking based on political hierarchies. The strengthening of those hierarchies, which was achieved in part by donating land for the temples and then attending worship, was necessary as the inland agrarian society grew rapidly in number and location. [85]
Society
There is a disparity between the analysis of inscriptions, of which the work of Cynthia Talbot has been in the vanguard and the traditional works of Vedic Hinduism that described pre-colonial India in terms of a reverent and static society that was subject to the strictures of the caste system . Colonial British administrators found much that appealed to them in the latter works but the Kakatiya inscriptions of Andhra Pradesh, which depict a far wider range of society and events, suggest that the reality was far more fluid and very different from the idealised image. [86]
Caste itself seems to have been of low importance as a social identifier. [87] There was a lack of consistency regarding the varna rank of Kakatiyas. In most of their inscriptions, no varna affiliation was specified. In the case of a few where it was specified, they were mostly recorded to have been Kshatriyas. A handful of the inscriptions however tried to portray them as Kshatriyas. [i] Anyone, regardless of birth, could acquire the nayaka title to denote warrior statusKshatriy and this they did. There is also little evidence that Kakatiya society paid much regard to caste identities, in the sense of jāti . Although occupation does appear to have been an important designator of social position, the inscriptions suggest that people were not bound to an occupation by birth. [88] [89]
The population became more settled in geographic terms. The growth of an agricultural peasant class subsumed many tribal people who previously had been nomadic.  The nexus of politics and military was a significant feature of the era, and the Kakatiya recruitment of peasants into the military did much to create a new warrior class, develop social mobility and to extend the influence of the dynasty into areas of its kingdom that previously would have been untouched. [90] The Kakatiya kings, and in particular the last two, encouraged an egalitarian ethos. The entrenched landed nobility that had existed before the dynasty found its power to be on the wane; the royal gifting of lands formerly in the possession of nobles to people of lesser status did much to effect this dilution.

Religion
Historian P.V.P. Sastry theorizes that the early Kakatiya chiefs were followers of Jainism . A story in the Siddhesvara-charita states that Madhavavarman, an ancestor of the Kakatiyas, obtained military strength by the grace of goddess Padmakshi . The 1123 Govindapuram Jain inscription of Polavasa, another family of feudatory chiefs, contains a similar account of how their ancestor Madhavavarman obtained military strength by the grace of the Jain goddess Yakshesvari. [91]
According to tradition, Prola II became a Veerahaivite , initiated by the Kalamukha preceptor Ramesvara Panditabefor and established Shaivism as his family's religion. The Shaivism-affiliated personal names of the later Kakatiya kings (such as Rudra, Mahadeva, Harihara, and Ganapati) also indicate a shift towards Shaivism. This, according to Sastry, strengthens the theory that the early Kakatiya chiefs were Jains. [5]
Genealogy
The following members of the Kakatiya family are known from epigraphic evidence. The rulers are children of their predecessors unless otherwise specified. [92]

Politics of Telangana
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Political system of Telangana
Leader of the House: TBA ( INC )
Leader of the Opposition: TBA ( BRS )
e
The Indian state of Telangana was founded in 2014. Its territory had formerly been part of Andhra Pradesh . The Telangana movement was instrumental in the creation of the new state, and Bharat Rashtra Samithi (previously, Telangana Rashtra Samithi), a party which led the Telangana movement after 2001, formed the government in the Telangana Legislative Assembly under its leader K. Chandrashekar Rao as the 1st Chief Minister of the state. The political landscape of Telangana is dominated by the Indian National Congress and the Bharat Rashtra Samithi, with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen being other significant forces.
The Indian National Congress draws most of its strength from rural areas whereas the Bharat Rashtra Samithi and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen have their strongholds in the GHMC and surrounding areas.
The Telugu Desam Party and the YSR Congress Party also used to have major sway in the state, although they have since lost most of their presence, and have been limited to residual Andhra Pradesh .
The incumbent Chief Minister of the state is Revanth Reddy from the Indian National Congress .
Telangana movement
Further information: Separate Telangana state movement
In the early Telangana movement, Marri Chenna Reddy formed a party called Telangana Praja Samithi to lead the Telangana movement. In November 1969, there was a major split in the party and as a result the movement declined. After two years the Telangana Praja Samithi was dissolved and its members rejoined the Congress. [1]
A successor party, Telangana Rashtra Samithi , was formed in 2001 by Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) . On 29 November 2009, KCR started a fast-unto-death , demanding that the Congress party introduce a Telangana bill in Parliament. [2] Student organisations, employee unions, and various organisations joined the movement. [3] As general strikes shut down much economic activity in Telangana, Telangana Bill was passed in Lok Sabha on 18 February 2014 [4] and in Rajya Sabha on 18 February 2014. [5] On 4 March 2014 the Government of India declared that 2 June would be the Telangana Formation Day. [6]

• Rank
Urdu: [ˈtɪləŋɡɑːna] ⓘ ) is a state in India situated in the south-central part of the Indian subcontinent on the high Deccan Plateau . [14] It is the eleventh largest state and the twelfth most populated state in India as per the 2011 census . [15] On 2 June 2014, the area was separated from the northwestern part of United Andhra Pradesh as the newly formed state of Telangana , with Hyderabad as its capital. Telugu , one of the classical languages of India , is the most widely spoken and the primary official language of the state.
The economy of Telangana is the ninth-largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹16.502 trillion (US$190 billion) and has a GSDP per capita of ₹390,564 (US$4,500) for the financial year 2024–25. [16] [17] Telangana scored 0.705 on the Human Development Index during 2017–2018. [11]
The state has emerged as a major focal point for IT software companies, industry and the services sector . The state is also the main administrative center of many Indian defence aerospace and research labs including Bharat Dynamics Limited , Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory , Defence Research and Development Organisation and Defence Research and Development Laboratory . [18]
Etymology
[ edit ]
One popular etymology derives the word ""Telangana"" from Trilinga desha (""land of three lingas ""), a region named after 3 important Shaivite shrines present in it: Kaleshwaram (present day Telangana), Srisailam and Draksharama (present day Andhra Pradesh ). [19]
According to Jayadheer Tirumala Rao , a scholar of history, the name Telangana is of Gondi origin. Rao asserts that it is derived from ""Telangadh"", which means ""south"" in Gondi and has been referred in ""Gond script dating back to about 2000 years"". [20]
One of the earliest uses of a word similar to Telangana can also be seen in a name of Malik Maqbul Tilangani (14th century CE), who was called the Tilangani, which implies that he was from Telangana. He was the commander of the Warangal Fort (Kataka Pāludu) and later Wazir — Minister under Firuz Shah Tughlaq . [21] [22]
A 16th-century travel writer, Firishta , recorded in his book:
During the just reign of Ibrahim Kootb Shah , Tulingana, like Egypt , became the mart of the whole world. Merchants from Toorkistan, Arabia, and Persia resorted to it; and they met with such encouragement that they found in it inducements to return frequently. The greatest luxuries from foreign parts daily abounded at the king's hospitable board. [23]
The word ""Telinga"" changed over time to ""Telangana"" and the name ""Telangana"" was designated to distinguish the predominantly Telugu-speaking region of the erstwhile Hyderabad State from its predominantly Marathi -speaking one, Marathwada . It is also called ""The land of Telugu people"". After Asaf Jahi 's ceded the Seemandhra region to the British, the rest of the Telugu region retained the name Telangana and the other parts were called Madras Presidency's Circars and Ceded. [24]
History
Main article: History of Telangana
Throughout antiquity and the Middle Ages, the Telangana region was part of multiple Indian empires; such as the Mauryans , Satavahanas , Vishnukundinas , Chalukyas , Cholas , Rashtrakutas , Kakatiyas , Delhi Sultanate , Bahmani Sultanate and Golconda Sultanate . During the 17th-19th centuries, the region was ruled by the Mughals and Nizam of Hyderabad . [25] [26] In 1823, the Nizams ceded Northern Circars —( Coastal Andhra ) and Ceded Districts —( Rayalseema ) to British India under a subsidiary alliance which reduced it to that of a landlocked princely state bounded on all sides by British India.
Following the Indian Independence in 1947 the Hyderabad state joined the Union of India in 1948 after a police action . In 1956, the Hyderabad State was dissolved and its Telugu-speaking region Telangana was merged with the Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh . A peasant-driven movement began to advocate for separation from Andhra Pradesh starting in the early 1950s, and continued until Telangana was granted statehood on 2 June 2014. [27]
The historic city Golconda in Hyderabad established itself as a diamond trading centre, and until the end of the 19th century the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in the world. Thus, the legendary name Golconda Diamonds became synonymous with Golconda itself.
Early history

From 230 BCE to 220 CE, the Satavahana dynasty became the dominant power in this area. It originated from the lands between the Godavari and Krishna rivers and was based at Amaravathi and Dharanikota. [28] After the decline of the Satavahanas, various dynasties, such as the Vakataka , Vishnukundina , Chalukya , Rashtrakuta and Western Chalukya , ruled the area. [29]
Medieval period

The Telangana area experienced its golden age during the reign of the Kakatiya dynasty , which ruled most parts of the present-day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana from 1083 to 1323 CE. [29] Rudrama Devi and Prataparudra II were prominent rulers from the Kakatiya dynasty. The dynasty weakened with the attack of Malik Kafur in 1309 and was dissolved after the defeat of Prataparudra by the forces of Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1323. [30] [31]
Golconda Fort
The area came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century, followed by the Bahmani Sultanate . Quli Qutb Mulk , a governor of Golconda, revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty in 1518. On 21 September 1687, the Golconda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after a year-long siege of the Golconda fort. [32]
During the early seventeenth century a strong cotton-weaving industry existed in Telangana. Large quantities of cotton were produced for domestic and exports consumption. High quality plain and patterned cloth made of muslin and calico was produced. [33]
In 1712, Qamar-ud-din Khan was appointed by emperor Farrukhsiyar as the viceroy of Deccan with the title Nizam-ul-Mulk (meaning ""Administrator of the Realm""). He was later recalled to Delhi, with Mubariz Khan appointed as the viceroy. In 1724, Qamar-ud-din Khan defeated Mubariz Khan to reclaim the Deccan suba, establishing it as an autonomous province of the Mughal empire. He took the name Asif Jah, starting what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty . [29] He named the area Hyderabad Deccan . Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were called Asif Jahi Nizams or nizams of Hyderabad . Hyderabad Nizams remained the tributary of marathas after suffering series of defeats paying annual chauth in return for retaining their domain. The Medak and Warangal divisions of Telangana were part of their realm. [34]
Telangana was the seat of numerous dynasties. The Chowmahalla Palace was home to the Nizams of Hyderabad .
Hyderabad State in 1909.
When Asif Jah I died in 1748, there was political unrest due to contention for the throne among his sons, who were aided by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. In 1769, Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Nizams. The Nizam Nasir-ud-dawlah, Asaf Jah IV signed the subsidiary alliance with the British in 1799 and lost its control over the state's defence and foreign affairs. Hyderabad State became a princely state among the presidencies and provinces of British India . [34]
In 1787, heavy flooding killed over 20,000 causing a plague which killed about 10,656,000 people in Telangana. [35]
Modern period
[ edit ]
When India became independent from the British Empire in 1947, the Nizam of Hyderabad did not want to merge with the Indian Union and wanted to remain independent. The Government of India annexed Hyderabad State on 17 September 1948 after a military operation called Operation Polo . [29] It appointed a civil servant, M. K. Vellodi , as first chief minister of Hyderabad State on 26 January 1950. [36] He administered the state with the help of English-educated bureaucrats from the Madras and Bombay states, who were familiar with British systems of administration unlike the bureaucrats of Hyderabad State who used a completely different administrative system. The official language of the state was switched from Urdu to English .
In 1952, Dr. Burgula Ramakrishna Rao was elected chief minister of the Hyderabad State in its first democratic election. During this time, there were violent agitations by some Telanganites to send the Madras state bureaucrats back and implement a rule by the natives (mulkis) of Hyderabad (Syed Alam Sharjil) was elected chief minister of Hyderabad after (Dr. Burgula Ramakrishana Rao) for one year after he resigned from the post. [37]
The Telangana Rebellion was a peasant revolt supported by the communists . It originated in the Telangana regions of the Hyderabad State between 1946 and 1951, led by the Communist Party of India (CPI). [38]
The revolt began in the Nalgonda district against the feudal lords of Reddy and Velama castes. It quickly spread to the Warangal and Bidar districts. Peasant farmers and labourers revolted against the local feudal landlords ( jagirdars and deshmukhs ) and later against the Nizam Osman Ali Khan . The violent phase of the movement ended after the government of India's Operation Polo . [39] Starting in 1951, the CPI shifted to a more moderate strategy of seeking to bring communism to India within the framework of Indian democracy. [40]
In December 1953, the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC) was appointed to form states on a linguistic basis. [41] An agreement was reached between Telangana leaders and Andhra leaders on 20 February 1956 to merge Telangana and Andhra with promises to safeguard Telangana's interests. [42] After reorganisation in 1956, the region of Telangana was merged with Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh.
Following this Gentlemen's agreement , the central government established the unified state of Andhra Pradesh on 1 November 1956. [43] [44] [45] G.O 553 of 1959 from the united Andhra Pradesh state moved two revenue divisions of Bhadrachalam from East Godavari and Aswaraopeta from West Godavari to Khammam for administrative convenience.
Main article: Telangana movement
There had been several movements to revoke the merger of Telangana and Andhra, major ones occurring in 1969, 1972, and 2009. The movement for a new state of Telangana gained momentum in the 21st century by an initiative of Kalvakuntla Chandrashekhar Rao from Bharat Rashtra Samithi later joined by the Telangana Political Joint Action Committee (TJAC), including political leadership representing the Telangana area. [46] On 9 December 2009 the government of India announced the process of formation of the Telangana state. Violent protests led by people in the Coastal Andhra and Rayalseema regions occurred immediately after the announcement, and the decision was put on hold on 23 December 2009.
The movement continued in Hyderabad and other districts of Telangana. [47] There were hundreds of claimed suicides, [48] strikes, protests and disturbances to public life demanding separate statehood.

History
[ edit ]
King Gondophares receives a letter from St. Thomas in Gujarat .
Saint Bartholomew , one of the Twelve Apostles landed [7] in Maharashtra and began his mission in Kalyan [8] and was followed by Saint Thomas [7] who landed in Gujarat during the reign of King Gondophares [9] and initiated the Gospel in parts of Bharuch [10] and Taxila before traveling southward to Kerala in 52 A.D. where he won many converts and established many churches, eventually traveling to Tamil Nadu where he was martyred in 72 A.D.  After centuries of inactivity, the missions were again revived with the arrival of Saint Francis Xavier in 1542 followed by Robert de Nobili in 1605 who arrived in Goa on the western coast.  The first Protestant missionaries arrived in 1706 with Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Plütschau of the Lutheran Missions who landed at Tranquebar on the eastern coast of Tamil Nadu.  However, the modern missions began to take shape only with the arrival of the Baptist Missions in 1793 led by William Carey , the Father of the Modern Missionary Movement. [11]
It was with this background [12] that Jawaharlal Nehru , [13] the first Prime Minister of India remarked in a parliamentary debate in 1955 [14] in the Lok Sabha that,
""Christianity in India is as old as Christianity itself.""
Christianity in Telangana
Catholic missionaries first set foot in the erstwhile Hyderabad State in 1535 [2] during the sixteenth century followed by the American Methodist missions in 1873, [2] the Baptist missions in 1875, [2] the Mennonite Brethren missions then followed by the Wesleyan Methodist missions in 1878 [15] [2] during the nineteenth century.
The beginnings of the church
[ edit ]
Once the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society set foot in the erstwhile Hyderabad State in 1878, [2] the missionaries led by Henry Little, William Burgess and the Indian Evangelist Benjamin Wesley [2] who pioneered the spread of the Gospel and helped in establishing of churches in areas northward of Hyderabad City winning of new converts to the fold of Christianity.
Meanwhile, efforts were made by visionary Pastors to form the Church of South India for which missionary societies came forward for negotiations who included [16] Anglicans , Baptists , Congregationalists , Lutherans , and Wesleyan Methodists .  However, the talks towards Church Union did not go well with the laymen hailing from the Baptists and the Lutherans in spite of efforts by their Clergy [17] led by Professor Muthyala Theophilus , CBCNC and William Powlas Peery , AELC [18] to join the Church of South India.  Meanwhile in 1923, [19] the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society participated in the negotiations towards Church union and formally agreed to join the Church of South India in 1947 and Frank Whittaker became the first Bishop of the Diocese of Medak.
The CSI and aftermath
[ edit ]
From 1947 onward, the church came under the Church of South India overseen by a Bishop residing in Medak , the ecclesiastical headquarters of the Diocese of Medak and was overseen by Bishops beginning with Frank Whittaker.  The Bishops used to appoint Pastors to lead the congregations in Christian love and faith so that the Christians lead selfless lives and set example for others.  The Clergy consisted of Pastors who had theological grounding under able scholars in seminaries either at the Andhra Christian Theological College or at the United Theological College, Bangalore . [2] The church also had visiting preachers from the nearby seminary, the Andhra Christian Theological College as well as other non-CSI churches in the city.
Ministerial formation
[ edit ]
Bishop Solomon Raj (right) and Rev. T. Bhasker (left), Vice-Chairman of the Diocese.
The Ministerial Secretary of the Diocese of Medak acts as the Vocation Promoter and for those discerning their avocation towards priesthood, the Diocese of Medak through its Ministerial Secretary examines candidates to determine their preparedness for the priestly vocation at varying points of time.  First, candidates are admitted to the Diocese of Medak and attached with a Priest in congregations and after a year or two they are sent for ministerial formation to a seminary affiliated to the Senate of Serampore College (University) .  Presently, the Diocese of Medak divides candidates between the Andhra Christian Theological College , Secunderabad and to the United Theological College, Bangalore .
It was in Medak [20] that the first seminary was established prior to 1947. [20] Incidentally, this College moved over to Dornakal and became the Andhra Union Theological College which later in 1964 [21] joined hands with the Anglicans , Baptists , Congregationalists , Lutherans , Methodists and Wesleyan Methodists to form the Andhra Christian Theological College , [21] originally located in Rajahmundry and moved to Secunderabad in 1972. [22] The Diocese is also represented in the United Theological College, Bangalore which was established in 1910. [20]

Emblem of Telangana
Use
As State Emblem
The Emblem of Telangana is the state emblem of Telangana in South India . [1] The arms has the Kakatiya Kala Thoranam in the middle, and the Charminar inside it and bordered in green. [2] [3]
Design
[ edit ]
The emblem is a circular seal consisting of the Kakatiya Kala Thoranam and Charminar with the Sarnath Lion Capital above. It has ""Telangana Prabhutvamu"" in Telugu.""Government of Telangana"" in English and ""Telangana Sarkar"" in Urdu and Satyameva Jayate is written in Sanskrit .
[ edit ]
The emblem was designed by painter, Laxman Aelay . [4] It was adopted on 2 June 2014 after the newly formed government headed by K. Chandrashekar Rao adopted it. It was the first file to be signed by him after swearing in. Initially, Charminar was not included.
Initially the national motto was written below the emblem. Naresh Kadyan, Abhishek Kadyan, and Sukanya Kadyan complained to the government about the alleged insult of the Emblem without the motto. The Sarnath Lion Capital , when used in heraldry, is required to have the words Satyameva Jayate underneath it, as per the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improver Use) Act, 2005, which the new logo violated when it was first released. [5] The emblem was corrected with an amendment approved by the Government of Telangana on 25 June 2014 made by Laxman Aelay, by moving the Satyameva Jayate below the Sarnath Lion Capital, complying with the national norm.

Huge challenges ahead for new Telangana tourism corporation

Undivided Andhra Pradesh has seen a constant yearly increase in domestic tourist arrivals in the last decade.
HYDERABAD: The government on Wednesday gave the go ahead for the creation of Telangana Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC), but experts said it has a monumental task ahead of it as tourism in the region lags behind Seemandhra in terms of revenue. The TTDC is expected to start functioning from June 2 onwards. Undivided Andhra Pradesh has seen a constant yearly increase in domestic tourist arrivals in the last decade.
The number of tourists breached the 20 crore mark in 2012, a year which also saw a surge in tourists in Telangana which till then had borne the brunt of the intense Telangana agitation. Out of the nearly 20.5 crore arrivals in 2012, Seemandhra played host to 11.5 crore tourists. The trend continued in 2013 as well, officials said. ""Most tourists head for Visakhapatnam, Araku and the beaches of East and West Godavari. A good percentage of people heading for Kerala and Goa have been known to make stops in coastal Andhra owing to the promotional activities of APTDC. Also, Tirupati and Bhadrachalam are major temple destinations attracting a large chunk of travellers,"" said Hemanth T Pandey of RK Tours and Travels. The disparity in tourist inflows also showcases itself in the revenue collections. Nearly 65 per cent of APTDC's revenue, largely earned from its hotel and tour packages, is generated in coastal Andhra. In Telangana, its Hyderabad and Warangal which make up the bulk of tourism revenue, officials said.
""There are many challenges before the TTDC. Though there are several sites in the region, these have to be aggressively promoted,"" ""Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Tirupati belt are major revenue earners,"" said a tourism department official. However, the new state may get some relief as the tourism department is currently working on modalities to share the revenue earningsfrom tours starting from Hyderabad to Seemandhra. ""Many tours to Vizag and Tirupati originate from Hyderabad. We are working on how the revenue can be shared between the regions,"" a department source said, adding that a consultant has been hired for the purpose. But it is unsure how long such an arrangement can last. ""Once a new state is created and a new airport is promotedlike the one in Hyderabad, tourists may not make the transit via Hyderabad,"" the official said. Meanwhile, the priority for Seemandhra would be to improve its foreign tourist arrivals. Around 3 lakh foreigners visited Andhra Pradesh annually in the last three years, which is a decline from the arrivals witnessed before 2009 when the Telangana agitation intensified. As of now, Hyderabad is the biggest contributor of foreign tourist revenues.
